Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling — Juzgado Contencioso-Administrativo de Valladolid — Interpretation of clause of the
                  Annex to Council Directive 1999/70/EC of June concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work concluded by ETUC,
                  UNICE and CEEP (OJ L 175, p. 43) — Principle of non-discrimination — Grant to teaching staff of a six-yearly continuing
                  professional education increment — Increment granted exclusively to established (career) civil servants.
               
Operative part 
Clause 4(1) of the framework agreement on fixed-term work, concluded on March and annexed to Council Directive 1999/70/EC
         of June concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work concluded by ETUC, UNICE and CEEP, must be interpreted
         as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which restricts, when there are no objective
         reasons to justify this, the right to receive a six-yearly continuing education increment solely to teachers employed as established
         (career) civil servants, to the exclusion of those working as temporary officials, when, in respect of the receipt of that
         increment, those two categories of workers are in comparable situations.
