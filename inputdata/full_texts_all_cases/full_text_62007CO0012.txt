Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Tribunale Civile di Genova – Direct attribution of the management of public services
                  and infrastructures to a company with a controlling role in the market concerned – Attribution to that company of the right
                  to determine the content of concession contracts existing between its own competitors and the State to determine those contracts
                  – Compatibility with Arts 43, 49, 82, and EC
               
Operative part 
The reference for a preliminary ruling by the Tribunale di Gevova, by decision of January 2007, is clearly inadmissible.
