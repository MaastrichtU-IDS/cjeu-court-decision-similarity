Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON DECEMBER 1981, THE APPLICANTS, WHO ARE OFFICIALS OR SERVANTS OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THEIR SALARY STATEMENTS AS FROM FEBRUARY .  IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DECIDED THAT THE PROCEEDINGS WOULD BE SUSPENDED PENDING THE DELIVERY OF JUDGMENTS IN CASE 737/BATTAGLIA ( JUDGMENTS OF DECEMBER AND JANUARY (( )) ECR AND (( )) ECR RESPECTIVELY ), CASE 59/COMMISSION V COUNCIL ( JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER (( )) ECR ) AND CASES TO 176, 233, AND 264/AMMAN AND OTHERS ( JUDGMENTS OF SEPTEMBER 1986, ECR 2647,2667,2687,2709, AND ).  BY A LETTER RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON DECEMBER 1986, THE COMMISSION CONFIRMED THAT IT HAD PAID TO THE APPLICANTS IN THESE PROCEEDINGS THE ARREARS DUE TO THEM UNDER COUNCIL REGULATION NO 3681/OF DECEMBER ADJUSTING THE WEIGHTINGS APPLICABLE IN ITALY TO THE REMUNERATION AND PENSIONS OF OFFICIALS AND OTHER SERVANTS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL 1983, L 368, P . ), ADOPTED FOLLOWING THE INTERLOCUTORY JUDGMENT DELIVERED BY THE COURT ON DECEMBER IN CASE 737/BATTAGLIA, CITED ABOVE . FOLLOWING THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF JANUARY 1985, WHICH FOLLOWED ON FROM THE ABOVEMENTIONED JUDGMENT OF DECEMBER 1982, IT ALSO PAID TO THE APPLICANTS DEFAULT INTEREST AT THE RATE OF 6% ON THE ARREARS PAID BY THE COMMISSION IN PURSUANCE OF THAT REGULATION .  THE SUPPLEMENTARY REMUNERATION CLAIMED WAS, ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSION, PAID TO THE APPLICANTS RETROACTIVELY PURSUANT TO COUNCIL REGULATION NO 3139/OF NOVEMBER AMENDING THE TABLES OF BASIC SALARIES LAID DOWN IN REGULATIONS ( ECSC, EEC, EURATOM ) NO 371/AND ( ECSC, EEC, EURATOM ) NO 372/AND ADJUSTING, WITH EFFECT FROM APRIL 1980, THE WEIGHTINGS APPLICABLE TO REMUNERATION AND PENSIONS PAYABLE IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES OF EMPLOYMENT ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL 1982, L 331, P . ), WHICH WAS ADOPTED FOLLOWING THE COURT' S JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER IN CASE 59/81, CITED ABOVE . THE COMMISSION DID NOT ACCEDE TO THE APPLICANTS' CLAIM REGARDING DEFAULT INTEREST ON THE SUPPLEMENTARY REMUNERATION PAID PURSUANT TO REGULATION NO 3139/. IN THAT CONNECTION, THE COMMISSION STATES THAT AN IDENTICAL CLAIM WAS DISPOSED OF BY THE JUDGMENTS OF THE COURT OF SEPTEMBER IN CASES TO 176, 233, AND 264/83, CITED ABOVE, ACCORDING TO WHICH DEFAULT INTEREST IS NOT PAYABLE . THE COMMISSION CONSIDERED THAT, IN VIEW OF THOSE JUDGMENTS, THE APPLICATION NO LONGER HAD ANY PURPOSE AND REQUESTED THE COURT TO DECLARE, PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, THAT THERE IS NO NEED TO GIVE A DECISION ON THE APPLICATION .  AS REGARDS THE COSTS, THE COMMISSION HAS CONCEDED THAT TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT THE PRESENT APPLICATION WAS PROMPTED BY THE POSITION THAT IT TOOK IN CASE 737/79, CITED ABOVE, IN WHICH IT RAISED OBJECTIONS OF INADMISSIBILITY . IT POINTS OUT, HOWEVER, THAT THE APPLICANTS HAVE FAILED IN THEIR SUBMISSIONS REGARDING DEFAULT INTEREST ON THE ARREARS PAID FOLLOWING THE ADOPTION OF REGULATION NO 3192/. IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMMISSION TOOK THE VIEW THAT IT WAS EQUITABLE FOR IT TO PAY, IN ADDITION TO BEARING ITS OWN COSTS, TWO-THIRDS OF THE COSTS OF THE APPLICANTS, AND THAT THE APPLICANTS SHOULD BEAR THE BALANCE THEMSELVES .  BY A LETTER RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON FEBRUARY 1987, COUNSEL FOR THE APPLICANTS INFORMED THE COURT THAT HE COULD NOT DISCONTINUE THE PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE MANDATE RECEIVED FROM HIS CLIENTS HE HAD NO AUTHORITY TO DO SO . HE LEFT IT FOR THE COURT TO RULE AS IT THOUGHT FIT ON THE PROPOSAL THAT IT SHOULD DECLARE THAT THERE WAS NO NEED TO GIVE A DECISION ON THE APPLICATION .  COUNSEL FOR THE PARTIES STATES, WITH RESPECT TO THE COSTS, THAT A CLAIM FOR INTEREST IS, IN PRINCIPLE, MERELY A SUBSIDIARY CLAIM, AS IN THIS CASE . THE COURT ORDERS INSTITUTIONS TO BEAR THE WHOLE OF THE COSTS WHERE AN OFFICIAL HAS IN ALL ESSENTIAL RESPECTS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN HIS SUBMISSIONS . MOREOVER, THE APPLICATION FOR PAYMENT OF INTEREST WAS FORMULATED IN BUT THE JUDGMENTS OF THE COURT DECIDING THAT ISSUE IN CASES TO 176, 233, AND 264/WERE NOT DELIVERED UNTIL SEPTEMBER .  IT MUST BE OBSERVED THAT THE APPLICANTS HAVE NOT DISPUTED THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BY THE COMMISSION IN ITS ABOVEMENTIONED LETTER OF DECEMBER OF THE MEASURES TAKEN BY IT WITH REGARD TO THEM . NOR HAVE THEY DENIED THAT, IN VIEW OF THOSE MEASURES, THE APPLICATION NO LONGER HAS ANY PURPOSE . IT MUST THEREFORE BE FOUND THAT THE APPLICATION NO LONGER HAS ANY PURPOSE AND THAT THERE IS NO NEED TO GIVE A DECISION ON IT .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  UNDER ARTICLE 69*() OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, WHERE A CASE DOES NOT PROCEED TO JUDGMENT, THE COSTS ARE TO BE AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COURT . THE COMMISSION CONCEDES THAT THE PRESENT APPLICATION WAS, TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT, PROMPTED BY THE POSITION THAT IT TOOK IN CASE 737/. MOREOVER, THE MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICANTS SHOW THAT IT CONCEDED THAT THEIR SUBMISSIONS WERE IN ALL ESSENTIAL RESPECTS WELL-FOUNDED . IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMMISSION MUST BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS NECESSARILY INCURRED BY THE APPLICANTS .  
Operative part
On those grounds,  THE COURT ( Second Chamber )  hereby orders :  ( ) There is no need to give a decision;  ( ) The defendant shall bear the costs .  Luxembourg, June .
