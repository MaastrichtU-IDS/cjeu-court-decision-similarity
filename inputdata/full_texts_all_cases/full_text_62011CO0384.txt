Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling — Rechtbank van eerste aanleg te Brussel — Interpretation of Article TFEU — Restrictions
                  on the free movement of capital — Tax legislation — Corporation tax — Tax on dividends — National rules providing for a 10%
                  withholding tax on dividends distributed by resident companies and on assimilated income — Imputation to corporation tax of
                  the amount withheld possible only for resident companies.
               
Operative part
Article TFEU must be interpreted as precluding the legislation of a Member State, such as that at issue in the main proceedings,
         which applies withholding tax to dividends distributed by a resident company to resident and non-resident recipient companies
         which have a holding of less than 10% in the capital of the distributing company but with a purchase value of at least EUR 1.million, while at the same time providing a mechanism for the mitigation of a series of charges to tax only for resident recipient
         companies. Where a Member State relies on a convention for the avoidance of double taxation concluded with another Member
         State, it is for the national court to establish whether account should be taken, in the main proceedings, of that convention,
         and, if so, to determine whether it enables the effects of the restriction on the free movement of capital to be neutralised.
