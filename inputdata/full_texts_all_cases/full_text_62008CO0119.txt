Article of Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of May on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating
         to turnover taxes – Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment, as amended by Council Directive 91/680/EEC
         of December 1991, must be interpreted as meaning that it does not preclude a tax such as the levy on revenue laid down
         by the Lithuanian Law on the financing of the road maintenance and development programme (Lietuvos Respublikos kelių priežiūros
         ir plėtros programos finansavimo įstatymas).
