Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1408/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE APPLICATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEMES TO EMPLOYED PERSONS AND THEIR FAMILIES MOVING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY ( OJ ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P . ) AND DECISION NO OF THE COMMISSION OF JULY CONCERNING THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE ( ) OF COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1408/RELATING TO THE AWARD OF BENEFITS DUE UNDER PARAGRAPH OF THE SAID ARTICLE ( OJ C OF . . , P . ), 
Grounds
BY JUDGMENT DATED JUNE , RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON THE FOLLOWING JULY , THE ARBEIDSRECHTBANK OF THE JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF HASSELT , BELGIUM , REFERRED UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY SEVERAL QUESTIONS ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1408/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ( OJ ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P . ) AND DECISION NO OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMISSION ON SOCIAL SECURITY FOR MIGRANT WORKERS CONCERNING THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE SAID REGULATION ( OJ C OF . . , P . ).   THESE QUESTIONS ARE RAISED IN THE CONTEXT OF AN ACTION RELATING TO THE CALCULATION BY THE RELEVANT BELGIAN INSTITUTION OF THE INVALIDITY PENSION OF A BELGIAN NATIONAL , THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION , WHO WORKED PARTLY IN BELGIUM AS AN UNDERGROUND MINER AND PARTLY IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY OUTSIDE THE MINING SECTOR .   THIS WORKER FULFILLED IN BELGIUM ALL THE CONDITIONS REQUIRED BY THE NATIONAL LEGISLATION TO ENTITLE HIM TO AN INVALIDITY PENSION UNDER THE SYSTEM APPLYING TO MINERS .   ON THE OTHER HAND TO ENTITLE HIM TO BENEFIT IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY HE HAD TO RELY ON THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1408/AND FOR THE CALCULATION OF THIS BENEFIT THE PERIODS COMPLETED IN THE TWO MEMBER STATES WERE AGGREGATED AND THE GERMAN BENEFIT APPORTIONED .   TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE RULE LIMITING THE OVERLAPPING OF BENEFITS PROVIDED IN DIFFERENT MEMBER STATES , WHICH IS LAID DOWN BY ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/AND DECISION NO OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMISSION , THE BELGIAN INSTITUTION BY DECISION DATED MAY REDUCED THE INVALIDITY PENSION FROM FB TO WHICH HE WAS ENTITLED UNDER BELGIAN LEGISLATION ALONE TO FB .    THIS SUM REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HIGHEST THERORETICAL AMOUNT , NAMELY THAT OF THE GERMAN PENSION ( FB ) AND THE GERMAN APPORTIONED AMOUNT ( FB ).   THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION CLAIMS THAT HE SHOULD BE AWARDED AT LEAST THE BELGIAN APPORTIONED AMOUNT ( FB ).   THIS METHOD OF CALCULATION BY THE BELGIAN INSTITUTION IS INTENDED TO PUT INTO PRACTICE A PRINCIPLE ACCORDING TO WHICH THE MIGRANT WORKER IS ASSURED OF RECEIVING IN TOTAL , BY VIRTUE OF THE VARIOUS PENSIONS GRANTED TO HIM BY THE VARIOUS MEMBER STATES , AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE HIGHEST BENEFIT HE WOULD HAVE OBTAINED IF HE HAD SPENT HIS WHOLE WORKING LIFE SUBJECT TO THE LEGISLATION OF ONE OR OTHER OF THE MEMBER STATES CONCERNED .   THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ARE ASKED :    ( A ) IT IS TO BE NOTED THAT DECISION NO REFERS TO THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) ( CALCULATION OF THE ADJUSTMENT ) WHILST THE PRINCIPLE OF THE LIMITATION OF THE TOTAL OF THE VARIOUS BENEFITS IS LAID DOWN IN THE FIRST SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ). DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF THE FIRST SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) IS NOT AFFECTED BY DECISION NO , OR IS IT TO BE ASSUMED THAT WHERE DECISION NO LAYS DOWN THE METHOD OF CALCULATION BY WHICH ANY AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT MUST BE ADJUSTED , IT ALSO IMPLIES A POSSIBILITY OF EXCEEDING THE HIGHEST THEORETICAL AMOUNT OPERATIVE IN THIS CONNEXION?    ( B ) MUST THE NATIONAL AMOUNTS WHICH HAVE BEEN CALCULATED BE COMPARED , FIRST , WITH THE THEORETICAL AMOUNT AND , SECONDLY , WITH THE APPORTIONED AMOUNT?    ( C ) OR IS A COMPARISON MADE ONLY BETWEN THE NATIONAL AMOUNT AND THE APPORTIONED AMOUNT?    ( D ) MUST A NATIONAL INSURANCE INSTITUTION COMPARE ONLY ITS OWN AMOUNTS WITH ONE ANOTHER ( NATIONAL , THEORETICAL AND/OR APPORTIONED AMOUNT)?    ( E ) OR MUST THE FIGURES FROM THE FOREIGN INSTITUTION ALSO BE INCLUDED IN THIS COMPARISON?    ( F ) WHAT IS THE POSITION IN THE CASE OF THE HYPOTHESIS UNDER QUESTION ( D ) WHERE DECISION NO IS APPLICABLE FOR ONE COUNTRY AND NOT FOR THE OTHER?    ( G ) IS IT IN AN APPROPRIATE CASE UNNECESSARY FOR THE TOTAL OF THE APPORTIONED AMOUNTS TO BE COMPARED WITH THE NATIONAL AMOUNTS?    BEFORE CONSIDERING THESE QUESTIONS IT IS WELL TO CONSIDER THE QUESTION OF THE VALIDITY OF THE REGULATION AND DECISION THE INTERPRETATION OF WHICH IS REQUESTED .   AS HAS ALREADY BEEN STATED IN OTHER CONTEXTS AND LASTLY BY THE JUDGMENT IN CASE 24/( PETRONI ( ) ECR ), THE REGULATIONS IN THE FIELDS OF SOCIAL SECURITY FOR MIGRANT WORKERS HAVE AS THEIR BASIS , THEIR FRAMEWORK AND THEIR BOUNDS ARTICLES TO OF THE TREATY .   ARTICLE REQUIRES THE COUNCIL TO ADOPT IN THE FIELD OF SOCIAL SECURITY SUCH MEASURES AS ARE ' NECESSARY '  TO PROVIDE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT FOR WORKERS , PROVIDING FOR THE AGGREGATION , IN PARTICULAR FOR THE PURPOSE OF ACQUIRING AND RETAINING THE RIGHT TO BENEFIT AND OF CALCULATING THE AMOUNT OF BENEFIT , OF ALL PERIODS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT UNDER THE VARIOUS NATIONAL LAWS .   THE AIM OF ARTICLES TO WOULD NOT BE ATTAINED IF , AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE EXERCISE OF THEIR RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT , WORKERS WERE TO LOSE ADVANTAGES IN THE FIELD OF SOCIAL SECURITY GUARANTEED TO THEM IN ANY EVENT BY THE LAWS OF A SINGLE MEMBER STATE .   ARTICLE ( ) TAKES THE FORM OF A RULE LIMITING OVERLAPPING AND THE COUNCIL , IN THE EXERCISE OF THE POWERS WHICH IT HOLDS UNDER ARTICLE CONCERNING THE COORDINATION OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEMES OF THE MEMBER STATES , HAS THE POWER , IN CONFORMITY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY , TO LAY DOWN DETAILED RULES FOR THE EXERCISE OF RIGHTS TO SOCIAL BENEFITS WHICH THE PERSONS CONCERNED DERIVE FROM THE TREATY .   DECISION NO OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMISSION ON SOCIAL SECURITY FOR MIGRANT WORKERS IS INTENDED TO INTERPRET THE SAID ARTICLE .   A LIMITATION ON THE OVERLAPPING OF BENEFITS WHICH WOULD LEAD TO A DIMINUTION OF THE RIGHTS WHICH THE PERSONS CONCERNED ALREADY ENJOY IN A MEMBER STATE BY VIRTUE OF THE APPLICATION OF THE NATIONAL LEGISLATION ALONE IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH ARTICLE .    IT IS THEREFORE PROPER TO CONCLUDE THAT ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/AND DECISION NO OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMISSION ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH ARTICLE OF THE TREATY TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY IMPOSE A LIMITATION ON THE OVERLAPPING OF TWO BENEFITS ACQUIRED IN DIFFERENT MEMBER STATES BY A REDUCTION OF THE AMOUNT OF THE BENEFIT ACQUIRED UNDER NATIONAL LEGISLATION ALONE .   THE ABOVE FINDINGS ON THE VALIDITY OF THE SAID REGULATION AND DECISION RENDER SUPERFLUOUS AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTIONS ON THEIR INTERPRETATATION .
