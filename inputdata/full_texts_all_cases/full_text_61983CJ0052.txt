Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE FRENCH REPUBLIC , BY NOT COMPLYING WITH THE COMMISSION DECISION OF JANUARY ON AN AID SCHEME IN FAVOUR OF THE TEXTILE AND CLOTHING INDUSTRY IN FRANCE , HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON MARCH , THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION PURSUANT TO THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE FRENCH REPUBLIC , BY NOT COMPLYING WITHIN THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED WITH COMMISSION DECISION NO 82/245/EEC OF JANUARY ON AN AID SCHEME IN FAVOUR OF THE TEXTILE AND CLOTHING INDUSTRY IN FRANCE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , . . , P . ), HAD FAILED TO FULFIL AN OBLIGATION UNDER THE TREATY .   IT APPEARS FROM THE FILE THAT , ON FEBRUARY , THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT NOTIFIED THE COMMISSION , IN PURSUANCE OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TREATY , OF A DRAFT ORDER FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN AID SCHEME IN FAVOUR OF THE TEXTILE AND CLOTHING INDUSTRY UNDER WHICH THE STATE WAS TO TAKE OVER PART OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY CONTRIBUTIONS PAYABLE BY EMPLOYERS IN THE INDUSTRY . THAT AID SCHEME WAS LATER ESTABLISHED BY ORDER NO 82-OF MARCH , PUBLISHED IN OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE FRENCH REPUBLIC NO OF MARCH . MEASURES FOR ITS IMPLEMENTATION WERE NOTIFIED TO THE COMMISSION ON APRIL AND BROUGHT INTO FORCE BY DECREE NO 82-OF THE SAME DATE , PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE FRENCH REPUBLIC NO OF  APRIL .        ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED ORDER NO 82-, THE TAKING OVER BY THE STATE OF PART OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY CONTRIBUTION IS TO BE SUBJECT TO THE CONCLUSION BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE EMPLOYER OF A CONTRACT FOR A PERIOD OF MONTHS SPECIFYING THE PROPORTION OF CONTRIBUTIONS TAKEN OVER AND THE COMMITMENTS ENTERED INTO BY THE EMPLOYER WITH REGARD TO THE MAINTENANCE OR CREATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND ATTAINING A CERTAIN LEVEL OF INVESTMENT . THE ARTICLE ALSO PROVIDES THAT NO CONTRACT MAY BE CONCLUDED AFTER DECEMBER , BUT CONTRACTS CONCLUDED BEFORE THAT DATE MAY BE RENEWED FOR A FURTHER PERIOD OF MONTHS .   THE COMMISSION GAVE THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT FORMAL NOTICE TO SUBMIT ITS OBSERVATIONS AND SUBSEQUENTLY , PURSUANT TO THE FIRST SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TREATY TOOK THE AFORMENTIONED DECISION WHICH LED TO THIS ACTION .   ARTICLE OF THAT DECISION PROVIDES :    ' ' THE FRENCH REPUBLIC SHALL , WITHIN ONE MONTH OF NOTIFICATION OF THIS DECISION , ABOLISH THE AID SCHEME IN FAVOUR OF THE TEXTILE AND CLOTHING INDUSTRY UNDER WHICH THE STATE TAKES OVER RESPONSIBILITY FOR PART OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY CONTRIBUTIONS PAYABLE BY EMPLOYERS IN THE INDUSTRY , INTRODUCED BY ORDER NO OF MARCH , THE IMPLEMENTING RULES FOR WHICH WERE LAID DOWN BY DECREE NO 82-OF APRIL .   FURTHERMORE , THE FRENCH REPUBLIC SHALL CEASE TO GRANT AID UNDER THE SCHEME IN QUESTION FROM THE DATE OF NOTIFICATION OF THIS DECISION .   THE DECISION WAS NOTIFIED TO THE FRENCH REPUBLIC ON JANUARY AND THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT DID NOT BRING AN ACTION WITHIN THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED BY THE THIRD PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT IT WAS VOID .   ON FEBRUARY , THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT SENT TO THE COMMISSION A COMMUNIQUE STATING THAT THE PROCEDURE FOR ' ' EMPLOYMENT-INVESTMENT ' '  CONTRACTS WOULD BE RE-IMPLEMENTED , DEGRESSIVELY , FOR A SECOND AND FINAL YEAR . THE COMMISSION TOOK THE VIEW THAT THE ISSUE OF THE COMMUNIQUE WAS     TANTAMOUNT TO A REFUSAL BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT TO COMPLY WITH ITS DECISION AND ACCORDINGLY BROUGHT THIS ACTION .   THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS THAT IT HAS FULLY COMPLIED WITH THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION . IT RECALLS THAT THE DECISION WAS ADOPTED AFTER THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED FOR THE CONCLUSION OF CONTRACTS HAD EXPIRED . CONSEQUENTLY , NO CONTRACT WAS CONCLUDED AFTER THE NOTIFICATION OF THE DECISION . THE GOVERNMENT ADMITS , ON THE OTHER HAND , THAT THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES CONTINUED TO FULFIL UNDERTAKINGS INTO WHICH THEY HAD ENTERED BY THE CONTRACTS ALREADY CONCLUDED . HOWEVER , IT IS OF THE VIEW THAT IT WAS ENTITLED TO INTERPRET THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION IN A MANNER WHICH WOULD PERMIT IT TO OBSERVE THE PRINCIPLE OF THE PROTECTION OF LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION , WHICH THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES WOULD HAVE BREACHED IF THEY HAD UNILATERALLY ABROGATED CONTRACTS ALREADY CONCLUDED . THE COURT ITSELF , IT IS CLAIMED , RECOGNIZED THE EXISTENCE OF THAT PRINCIPLE IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN ITS JUDGMENT OF JULY ( IN CASE 70/COMMISSION V GERMANY ( ) ECR ).   IT MUST BE OBSERVED THAT , IN CONTRAST TO THE DECISION WHICH LED TO CASE 70/, THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION OF JANUARY INDICATED CLEARLY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY THE OBLIGATIONS THEREBY IMPOSED ON THE FRENCH REPUBLIC . IT REQUIRED THE LATTER , FROM THE DATE OF NOTIFICATION , NO LONGER TO GRANT ANY AID UNDER THE SCHEME IN QUESTION AND , WITHIN A PERIOD OF ONE MONTH , TO ABOLISH THE SCHEME . HOWEVER , IT IS COMMON GROUND THAT THE FRENCH REPUBLIC CONTINUED TO PAY THE AID FOR WHICH THE SCHEME PROVIDED TO ANY EMPLOYER WHO HAD MADE A CONTRACT AND THAT THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT TOOK NO STEPS TO ABOLISH THE AID SCHEME WITHIN THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED BY THE DECISION .   MOREOVER , THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT ' S ARGUMENT WITH REGARD TO THE PRINCIPLE OF THE PROTECTION OF LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION DOES NOT RELATE TO THE INTERPRETATION OF THE DECISION , BUT CONSTITUTES A CONTENTION RELATING TO ITS VALIDITY , WHICH COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN RAISED IN SUPPORT OF AN APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT IT WAS VOID . IN FACT , AS THE COURT HAS ALREADY STRESSED IN ITS JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER ( CASE 156/COMMISSION V BELGIUM , ( )     ECR ), TO ALLOW A MEMBER STATE TO WHICH A DECISION ADOPTED UNDER THE FIRST SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) HAS BEEN ADDRESSED A FURTHER OPPORTUNITY TO CALL IN QUESTION THE VALIDITY OF THAT DECISION ON THE OCCASION OF AN APPLICATION REFERRED TO IN THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF THAT ARTICLE , IN SPITE OF THE EXPIRY OF THE PERIOD LAID DOWN IN THE THIRD PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY , WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO RECONCILE WITH THE PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE LEGAL REMEDIES ESTABLISHED BY THE TREATY AND WOULD JEOPARDIZE THE STABILITY OF THAT SYSTEM AND THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY UPON WHICH IT IS BASED .   IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES , IT MUST BE DECLARED THAT THE MEMBER STATE IN QUESTION HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS , AS CONTENDED IN THE COMMISSION ' S CONCLUSIONS .
