Subject of the case
APPLICATION CONCERNING , AT THE PRESENT STAGE OF THE PROCEDURE , THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION MADE BY COCKERILL-SAMBRE SA FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE COMMISSION ' S INDIVIDUAL DECISION C ( ) 1958/OF DECEMBER IMPOSING A FINE ON THE APPLICANT IS VOID , 
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON FEBRUARY , COCKERILL-SAMBRE SA , A STEEL UNDERTAKING WHOSE REGISTERED OFFICE IS AT SERAING , BELGIUM , BROUGHT AN ACTION BEFORE THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT COMMISSION DECISION C ( ) 1958/OF DECEMBER IMPOSING A FINE OF ECU ON THE APPLICANT FOR EXCEEDING THE QUOTAS FIXED FOR THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS OF UNDER COMMISSION DECISION 1696/OF JUNE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) IS VOID . IN THE ALTERNATIVE , THE APPLICANT ASKS THE COURT TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF THE FINE .  THE DECISION AT ISSUE WAS ADDRESSED TO APPLICANT COMPANY ' S REGISTERED OFFICE BY A REGISTERED LETTER DATED JANUARY IN RESPECT OF WHICH THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF RECEIPT WAS SIGNED ON JANUARY . THE COMPANY THEN TRANSMITTED THE DOCUMENT TO ITS CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION IN BRUSSELS , WHERE IT WAS RECEIVED ON JANUARY .   THE COMMISSION RAISED A PRELIMINARY OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY ALLEGING THAT THE APPLICATION WAS OUT OF TIME . IT CONTENDED THAT ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF THE STATUTE OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLES AND OF THE ECSC TREATY , ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COURT AND ARTICLE OF ANNEX II TO THOSE RULES , THE APPLICATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT WITHIN ONE MONTH AND TWO DAYS OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THAT ON WHICH THE APPLICANT RECEIVED NOTICE OF THE DECISION . SINCE NOTICE WAS RECEIVED BY THE APPLICANT ON JANUARY , THE APPLICATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN LODGED NOT LATER THAN FEBRUARY .   THE APPLICANT CONTESTS THE PROPOSITION THAT NOTICE OF THE DECISION TO ITS REGISTERED OFFICE AT SERAING CAUSED TIME TO RUN IN REGARD TO THE TIME-LIMIT FOR THE BRINGING OF ACTIONS . IT EMPHASIZES THAT AS EARLY AS MAY IT INFORMED INTER ALIA THE COMMISSION BY LETTER THAT IT HAD DECIDED TO TRANSFER THE OFFICES OF THE PRESIDENT AND OF THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER DEPARTMENTS OF THE COMPANY ' S TOP MANAGEMENT TO BRUSSELS . FURTHERMORE , SINCE THE COMMISSION FAILED TO ACT UPON THAT CHANGE , THE APPLICANT EXPRESSLY ASKED IT , IN TWO LETTERS OF DECEMBER , TO ADDRESS ' ALL CORRESPONDENCE '  TO ITS CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION IN BRUSSELS ' IN ORDER TO AVOID ITS BEING LOST OR DELAYED AT THE REGISTERED OFFICE IN SERAING AND TO MARK IT FOR THE ATTENTION OF THE PERSON FOR WHOM IT WAS ULTIMATELY INTENDED OR OF G . PAULUS , GROUP QUOTAS , WHO WILL TRANSMIT IT ' . HOWEVER , WITHOUT INFORMING THE APPLICANT THAT IT WAS UNWILLING TO ACCEDE TO THAT REQUEST , THE COMMISSION SENT THE CONTESTED DECISION ON JANUARY TO THE REGISTERED OFFICE AT SERAING WHICH TRANSMITTED IT WITH THE GREATEST POSSIBLE DILIGENCE TO THE APPLICANT ' S ADMINISTRATIVE HEADQUARTERS IN BRUSSELS .  THE APPLICANT ACCEPTS THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY INDICATION TO THE CONTRARY , THE COMMISSION IS ENTITLED TO GIVE NOTICE OF SUCH A DECISION AT THE REGISTERED OFFICE OF THE UNDERTAKING CONCERNED . HOWEVER , SINCE THE PLACE AT WHICH NOTICE MUST BE GIVEN IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED EITHER IN THE TREATY OR IN THE PROVISIONS IMPLEMENTING IT , NOTHING PREVENTS AN UNDERTAKING FROM ASKING THE COMMISSION TO GIVE IT NOTICE OF THE DECISIONS WHICH IT TAKES CONCERNING IT AT AN ADDRESS WHICH PERMITS IT TO REACT AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE . CONSEQUENTLY , IF THE COMMISSION IGNORES SUCH A REQUEST ON THE PART OF THE UNDERTAKING , NOTICE OF THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION IS NOT DULY GIVEN AND THE TIME-LIMIT FOR BRINGING AN ACTION IS TO BE CALCULATED FROM THE TIME AT WHICH THE UNDERTAKING ACTUALLY ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE OF THE DECISION . IN THIS CASE , THE APPLICANT ONLY ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE OF THE DECISION ON JANUARY , WITH THE RESULT THAT THE ACTION WAS BROUGHT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED TIME-LIMIT .  IN THE ALTERNATIVE , THE APPLICANT CLAIMS THAT THE COMMISSION IS NOT WELL PLACED TO RAISE AN OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY IN THIS CASE SINCE THE FACT THAT THE APPLICANT ONLY BECAME AWARE OF THE DECISION AT ISSUE ON JANUARY IS DUE TO THE COMMISSION ' S NEGLIGENCE . IN ANY EVENT , THERE WERE A NUMBER OF UNFORESEEABLE CIRCUMSTANCES IN THIS CASE WHICH OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED IN FAVOUR OF THE APPLICANT .  THE COMMISSION REPLIES THAT NOTICE OF A DECISION SUCH AS THE ONE AT ISSUE MUST BE GIVEN AT THE REGISTERED OFFICE OF THE UNDERTAKING CONCERNED IN ORDER TO AVOID ANY AMBIGUITY . IN THE ALTERNATIVE , THE COMMISSION OBSERVES THAT NEITHER THE LETTER OF MAY NOR THOSE OF DECEMBER MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE COMMISSION WAS REQUIRED TO GIVE NOTICE OF A DECISION IMPOSING A FINE ON THE APPLICANT COMPANY AT THE LATTER ' S NEW ADDRESS .  IT IS NOT DISPUTED THAT ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS REFERRED TO ABOVE BY THE COMMISSION THE TIME-LIMIT FOR BRINGING AN ACTION IN THIS CASE WAS ONE MONTH AND TWO DAYS FROM THE DAY AFTER THE ONE ON WHICH THE APPLICANT RECEIVED NOTICE OF THE DECISION AT ISSUE . IT IS ALSO NOT DISPUTED THAT A REGISTERED LETTER WITH ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF RECEIPT IS A PERFECTLY SUITABLE METHOD OF GIVING NOTICE INASMUCH AS IT ENABLES THE DATE FROM WHICH TIME BEGINS TO RUN TO BE DETERMINED , AS THE COURT EXPRESSLY HELD IN ITS JUDGMENT OF MAY ( CASE 224/FERRIERA VITTORIA SRL V COMMISSION ( ) ECR ).  THE ONLY QUESTIONS WHICH REMAIN TO BE DECIDED BY THE COURT ARE WHETHER THE COMMISSION COULD PROPERLY GIVE NOTICE OF THE DECISION AT ISSUE AT THE APPLICANT ' S REGISTERED OFFICE IN SERAING AND IF THAT IS SO , WHETHER THE APPLICANT HAS DEMONSTRATED THE EXISTENCE OF UNFORESEEABLE CIRCUMSTANCES OR FORCE MAJEURE WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE STATUTE OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY .  AS THE COURT DECIDED IN ITS JUDGMENT OF JULY ( CASE 209/FERRIERA VALSABBIA V COMMISSION ( ) ECR ), THE STRICT APPLICATION OF COMMUNITY RULES ON PROCEDURAL TIME-LIMITS SERVES THE REQUIREMENT OF LEGAL CERTAINTY AND THE NEED TO AVOID ANY DISCRIMINATION OR ARBITRARY TREATMENT IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE . IT IS ALSO SETTLED CASE-LAW THAT THE EXISTENCE OF VALID NOTICE IS IN NO WAY SUBJECT TO EFFECTIVE KNOWLEDGE ACTUALLY BEING ACQUIRED BY THE PERSON WHO , ACCORDING TO THE INTERNAL RULES OF THE UNDERTAKING TO WHICH THE DECISION IS ADDRESSED , IS COMPETENT TO DEAL WITH THE MATTER AND THAT A DECISION IS DULY NOTIFIED ONCE IT HAS BEEN COMMUNICATED TO THE PERSON TO WHOM IT IS ADDRESSED AND THE LATTER IS IN A POSITION TO TAKE COGNIZANCE OF IT .  ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF COMPANY LAW IN THE MEMBER STATES , AS COORDINATED BY COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES , THE REGISTERED OFFICE OF A COMPANY IS THE ONLY PLACE WHICH IS REQUIRED TO BE MENTIONED IN THE COMPANY ' S OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS AND TO BE RECORDED IN THE PUBLIC REGISTERS . FOR THAT REASON , NOTIFICATION OF A MEASURE TO THE REGISTERED OFFICE MEETS IN ALL CASES THE REQUIREMENT OF LEGAL CERTAINTY AND , MOREOVER , MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY TO TAKE COGNIZANCE OF THE MEASURE BEING NOTIFIED . CONSEQUENTLY , COMPANIES HAVE NO RIGHT TO REQUIRE THAT THE COMMISSION GIVE NOTICE AT A PLACE OTHER THAN THE REGISTERED OFFICE OR TO A PARTICULAR PERSON .  IT FOLLOWS THAT THE DECISION AT ISSUE WAS PROPERLY AND VALIDLY SERVED ON THE APPLICANT ON JANUARY . NEITHER THE FACT THAT THE COMMISSION DID NOT REPLY TO THE APPLICANT ' S LETTERS SEEKING TO HAVE DECISIONS NOTIFIED TO THE COMPANY ' S CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION NOR , EVEN LESS , THE COMPANY ' S INTERNAL PROBLEMS OF COMMUNICATION CONSTITUTE UNFORESEEABLE CIRCUMSTANCES OR FORCE MAJEURE WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE STATUTE OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY . THE ACTION HAS THEREFORE BEEN BROUGHT OUT OF TIME AND MUST CONSEQUENTLY BE DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE .
