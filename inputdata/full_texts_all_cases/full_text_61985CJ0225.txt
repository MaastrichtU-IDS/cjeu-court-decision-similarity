Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JULY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT BY DISCRIMINATING, AS REGARDS CONDITIONS OF WORK AND EMPLOYMENT, AGAINST NATIONALS OF OTHER MEMBER STATES WORKING FOR THE CONSIGLIO NAZIONALE DELLE RICERCHE ( NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL, HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS "THE CNR ") IN FAVOUR OF RESEARCHERS OF ITALIAN NATIONALITY WORKING FOR THAT BODY, THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY AND ARTICLE ( ) AND ( ) OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1612/OF THE COUNCIL OF OCTOBER ON FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT OF WORKERS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL, ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P . ).  ARTICLE ( ) OF ITALIAN LAW NO OF MARCH ( GAZZETTA UFFICIALE DELLA REPUBBLICA ITALIANA NO OF APRIL ) PROVIDES THAT STAFF EMPLOYED UNDER CONTRACT BY THE CNR ON THE DATE OF THAT LAW' S ENTRY INTO FORCE ( APRIL ) ARE TO BE APPOINTED TO ESTABLISHED POSTS PROVIDED THAT THEY HAVE THE REQUISITE QUALIFICATIONS AND FULFIL THE PRESCRIBED REQUIREMENTS . ARTICLE ( ) PROVIDES THAT, IN THE ABSENCE OF ESTABLISHED POSTS, STAFF EMPLOYED UNDER CONTRACT ARE TO CONTINUE TO BE ENGAGED FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD AND TO RECEIVE THE SAME REMUNERATION AS ESTABLISHED STAFF OF THE CORRESPONDING LEVEL . IN BOTH CASES "ACCOUNT SHALL BE TAKEN OF PREVIOUS YEARS OF SERVICE FOR THE PURPOSE OF CALCULATING PERIODICAL INCREASES IN SALARY ".  IN ADDITION, ARTICLE ( ) OF LAW NO REFERS TO THE "LEGAL RULES IN FORCE IN THE CIVIL SERVICE WITH REGARD TO RECRUITMENT REQUIREMENTS ". THESE INCLUDE THE PROVISIONS CONCERNING THE REGULATIONS FOR CIVIL SERVANTS ( DECRETO DEL PRESIDENTE DELLA REPUBBLICA NO OF JANUARY 1957, GAZZETTA UFFICIALE DELLA REPUBBLICA ITALIANA, ORDINARY SUPPLEMENT TO GAZZETTA UFFICIALE NO OF JANUARY ), ARTICLE OF WHICH PROVIDES THAT : "ANY PERSON WHO SATISFIES THE FOLLOWING GENERAL CONDITIONS MAY BE APPOINTED A CIVIL SERVANT : ( ) POSSESSION OF ITALIAN NATIONALITY ...".  THE COMMISSION, CONSIDERING THAT THE ABOVEMENTIONED NATIONALITY REQUIREMENT FOR RESEARCHERS APPLYING FOR ESTABLISHED POSTS ( OR, WHERE SUCH POSTS ARE TEMPORARILY UNAVAILABLE, FOR  CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD ) WAS CONTRARY TO ARTICLE OF THE TREATY AND TO REGULATION NO 1612/68, BROUGHT THIS ACTION AGAINST THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC FOR FAILURE TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS .  REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING FOR A FULLER ACCOUNT OF THE FACTS OF THE CASE, THE PROCEDURE AND THE SUBMISSIONS AND ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES, WHICH ARE MENTIONED OR DISCUSSED HEREINAFTER ONLY IN SO FAR AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE REASONING OF THE COURT .  THE FIRST QUESTION RAISED BY THIS APPLICATION IS WHETHER RESEARCHERS' POSTS AT THE CNR ARE TO BE REGARDED AS BEING "EMPLOYMENT IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE" TO WHICH THE RULE PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION SET OUT IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THE EEC TREATY DOES NOT APPLY BY VIRTUE OF ARTICLE ( ).  IN DECIDING THIS QUESTION IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND THAT, AS A DEROGATION FROM THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE THAT WORKERS IN THE COMMUNITY SHOULD ENJOY FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AND NOT SUFFER DISCRIMINATION, ARTICLE ( ) MUST BE CONSTRUED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO LIMIT ITS SCOPE TO WHAT IS STRICTLY NECESSARY FOR SAFEGUARDING THE INTERESTS WHICH THAT PROVISION ALLOWS THE MEMBER STATES TO PROTECT .  AS THE COURT HAS ALREADY STATED, MOST RECENTLY IN ITS JUDGMENT OF JULY IN CASE 66/LAWRIE-BLUM V LAND BADEN-WUERTTEMBERG (( )) ECR AT P . 2139, ACCESS TO CERTAIN POSTS MAY NOT BE LIMITED BY REASON OF THE FACT THAT IN A GIVEN MEMBER STATE PERSONS APPOINTED TO SUCH POSTS HAVE THE STATUS OF CIVIL SERVANTS . TO MAKE THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLE ( ) DEPENDENT ON THE LEGAL NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE  EMPLOYEE AND THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD ENABLE THE MEMBER STATE TO DETERMINE AT WILL THE POSTS COVERED BY THE EXCEPTION LAID DOWN IN THAT PROVISION .  IT MUST BE HELD THAT THE CONDITIONS DEFINED IN THE COURT' S CASE-LAW, IN PARTICULAR IN THE JUDGMENT OF DECEMBER IN CASE 149/COMMISSION V BELGIUM (( )) ECR 3881, WHICH A POST MUST SATISFY IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE REGARDED AS EMPLOYMENT IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE EEC TREATY ARE NOT FULFILLED IN THIS CASE . SIMPLY REFERRING TO THE GENERAL TASKS OF THE CNR AND LISTING THE DUTIES OF ALL ITS RESEARCHERS IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH THAT THE RESEARCHERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EXERCISING POWERS CONFERRED BY PUBLIC LAW OR FOR SAFEGUARDING THE GENERAL INTERESTS OF THE STATE . ONLY THE DUTIES OF MANAGEMENT OR OF ADVISING THE STATE ON SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL QUESTIONS COULD BE DESCRIBED AS EMPLOYMENT IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ). HOWEVER, IT HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT THOSE DUTIES WERE CARRIED OUT BY CNR RESEARCHERS .  AS TO THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT' S ARGUMENT THAT IF FOREIGN RESEARCHERS WERE TO BECOME PART OF THE CNR' S PERMANENT STAFF, IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE TO DENY THEM ACCESS, BY PROMOTION, TO THE HIGHER MANAGERIAL POSTS OF THAT BODY, IT IS SUFFICIENT TO POINT OUT THAT COMMUNITY LAW DOES NOT PROHIBIT A MEMBER STATE FROM RESERVING FOR ITS OWN NATIONALS THOSE POSTS WITHIN A CAREER BRACKET WHICH INVOLVE PARTICIPATION IN THE EXERCISE OF POWERS CONFERRED BY PUBLIC LAW OR THE SAFEGUARDING OF THE GENERAL INTERESTS OF THE STATE . HOWEVER, AS THE COURT HAS ALREADY STATED IN THE JUDGMENT OF DECEMBER 1980, CITED ABOVE, THE POSSIBILITY THAT NATIONALS OF OTHER MEMBER STATES MIGHT BE EXCLUDED FROM PROMOTION OR TRANSFER TO CERTAIN POSTS MUST NOT  HAVE THE EFFECT OF DEBARRING THEM GENERALLY FROM POSTS WHICH ARE NOT IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TREATY .  FURTHERMORE, AS THE COURT HELD IN ITS JUDGMENT OF FEBRUARY IN CASE 152/SOTGIU V DEUTSCHE BUNDESPOST (( )) ECR 153, EVEN IF EMPLOYMENT IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) IS INVOLVED, THAT PROVISION CANNOT JUSTIFY DISCRIMINATORY MEASURES WITH REGARD TO REMUNERATION OR OTHER CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT AGAINST WORKERS FROM OTHER MEMBER STATES ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN ADMITTED TO THE PUBLIC SERVICE .  IT THEREFORE FALLS TO BE DETERMINED WHETHER THE NON-APPLICATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE AFOREMENTIONED ITALIAN LAW NO CONSTITUTES DISCRIMINATION CONTRARY TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TREATY AND TO ARTICLE ( ) AND ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1612/.  IN THIS REGARD IT MUST BE OBSERVED THAT THE SITUATION OF RESEARCHERS WHO ARE NATIONALS OF OTHER MEMBER STATES IS DISCRIMINATORY BY COMPARISON WITH THAT OF ITALIAN RESEARCHERS, PARTICULARLY AS REGARDS JOB SECURITY, SINCE THEY ARE EMPLOYED BY THE CNR UNDER CONTRACTS OF LIMITED DURATION AND THEY HAVE NO GUARANTEE THAT THOSE CONTRACTS WILL BE RENEWED . MOREOVER, IT MUST BE NOTED THAT THE FACT THAT RESEARCHERS WHO ARE NATIONALS OF OTHER MEMBER STATES HAVE NO CAREER STRUCTURE MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO MOVE TO HIGHER GRADES AND HAS AN IMPACT ON THEIR PAY AND RETIREMENT PENSIONS . CONSEQUENTLY, THOSE RESEARCHERS DO NOT ENJOY A SYSTEM ENTAILING ADVANTAGES AND GUARANTEES EQUIVALENT TO THOSE DERIVING FROM THE STATUS RESERVED FOR ITALIAN NATIONALS .  IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, IT MUST BE HELD THAT BY  DISCRIMINATING, AS REGARDS CONDITIONS OF WORK AND EMPLOYMENT, AGAINST RESEARCHERS WORKING FOR THE CONSIGLIO NAZIONALE DELLE RICERCHE WHO ARE NATIONALS OF OTHER MEMBER STATES IN FAVOUR OF RESEARCHERS OF ITALIAN NATIONALITY WORKING FOR THAT BODY, THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY AND ARTICLE ( ) AND ( ) OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1612/OF THE COUNCIL OF OCTOBER .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS . SINCE THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED IN ITS SUBMISSIONS, IT MUST BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .  
Operative part
On those grounds,  THE COURT  hereby :  ( ) Declares that by discriminating, as regards conditions of work and employment, against researchers working for the Consiglio nazionale delle ricerche who are nationals of other Member States in favour of researchers of Italian nationality working for that body, the Italian Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article of the EEC Treaty and Article ( ) and ( ) of Regulation ( EEC ) No 1612/of the  Council of October 1968;  ( ) Orders the Italian Republic to pay the costs .
