	Declares that, by maintaining in its legislation a requirement of French nationality for access to the posts of master (captain)
                     and officer (chief mate) on all vessels flying the French flag, the French Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under
                     Article EC;
                  
2.
	Orders the French Republic to pay the costs.
