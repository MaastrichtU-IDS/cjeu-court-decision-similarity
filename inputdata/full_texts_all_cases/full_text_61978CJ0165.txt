FOR AN INTERPRETATION OF THE NOMENCLATURE OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF AND OF THE GENERAL RULES FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF THAT NOMENCLATURE .  
Grounds
1BY AN ORDER OF JUNE WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JULY , THE BUNDESFINANZHOF SUBMITTED THE FOLLOWING PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY :  ' ' . IS THE APPLICATION OF THE SECOND SENTENCE OF RULE ( A ) OF THE GENERAL RULES FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF THE NOMENCLATURE OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF EXCLUDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE THIRD SENTENCE OF GENERAL RULE IF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF CONTAINS A SPECIAL TARIFF HEADING FOR THE PARTS OF AN UNASSEMBLED OR DISASSEMBLED ( ' ZERLEGT ' ) ARTICLE?   IF THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION IS IN THE NEGATIVE :    . MUST THE SECOND SENTENCE OF GENERAL RULE ( A ) OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT , IN ADDITION TO ARTICLES WHICH ARE ' ZERLEGT '  IT ALSO COVERS ARTICLES WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN ASSEMBLED?   IF THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION IS IN THE AFFIRMATIVE :    . DOES THE SECOND SENTENCE OF GENERAL RULE ( A ) ALSO APPLY IF , WHEN A NUMBER OF PARTS OF ARTICLES WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN ASSEMBLED IS PRESENTED FOR CUSTOMS CLEARANCE , IT IS UNCERTAIN WHICH PARTS WILL BE ASSEMBLED WITH WHICH OTHER PARTS TO FORM AN ARTICLE?  ' '    2THESE QUESTIONS WERE RAISED IN THE CONTEXT OF A DISPUTE CONCERNING A BINDING OPINION AS TO TARIFF CLASSIFICATION ( VERBINDLICHE ZOLLTARIFAUSKUNFT ), ISSUED ON THE APPLICATION OF A GERMAN IMPORTER , THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION , BY THE OBERFINANZDIREKTION BERLIN , THE DEFENDANT IN THE MAIN ACTION , SETTING OUT THE HEADINGS OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF APPLICABLE TO THE ARTICLES DESCRIBED BY THE PLAINTIFF AS ' ' PARTS FOR ' FISHER SPACE PEN '  ( CAPS , BARRELS AND MAGAZINES ) ' '  WHICH IT INTENDED TO IMPORT FROM THE UNITED STATES INTO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY WITH A VIEW TO ASSEMBLING THEM TO FORM BALL-POINT PENS .   3THE FILE ESTABLISHES THAT THE CAPS AND BARRELS , IN VARIOUS FINISHES , CONTAIN ALL THE PARTS OF THE DEVICE AND ARE SUPPLIED IN PAIRS , WHILST THE MAGAZINES , WHICH ARE OF DIFFERENT SIZES AND MIXED COLOURS , AND ARE SUPPLIED IN BOXES OF UNITS , ARE INTENDED IN PART TO BE ASSEMBLED WITH THE CAPS AND BARRELS WITH WHICH THEY ARE IMPORTED AND IN PART TO SUPPLEMENT THE PLAINTIFF ' S STOCK OF REFILL-MAGAZINES .   4THE DEFENDANT , IN ITS CLASSIFICATION OPINION OF JUNE , STATED THAT THE CAPS , BARRELS AND THE CORRESPONDING NUMBER OF MAGAZINES CAME UNDER SUBHEADING 98.A OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF ( ' ' FOUNTAIN-PENS AND STYLOGRAPH PENS AND PENCILS ( INCLUDING BALL-POINT , FELT-TIPPED AND FIBRE-TIPPED PENS AND PENCILS ) ' ' ) AS PARTS FOR BALL-POINT PENS . FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE CAPS AND BARRELS AND THE CORRESPONDING NUMBER OF MAGAZINES INTENDED TO BE ASSEMBLED IN THE FORM OF BALL-POINT PENS , THE DEFENDANT RELIED ON GENERAL RULE ( A ) OF THE RULES FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF THE NOMENCLATURE OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF , WHICH PROVIDES :    ' ' ANY REFERENCE IN A HEADING TO AN ARTICLE SHALL BE TAKEN TO INCLUDE A REFERENCE TO THAT ARTICLE INCOMPLETE OR UNFINISHED , PROVIDED THAT , AS IMPORTED , THE INCOMPLETE OR UNFINISHED ARTICLE HAS THE ESSENTIAL CHARACTER OF THE COMPLETE OR FINISHED ARTICLE . IT SHALL ALSO BE TAKEN TO INCLUDE A REFERENCE TO THAT ARTICLE COMPLETE OR FINISHED ( OR FALLING TO BE CLASSIFIED AS COMPLETE OR FINISHED BY VIRTUE OF THIS RULE ), IMPORTED UNASSEMBLED OR DISASSEMBLED . ' '   5THE PLAINTIFF CLAIMS THAT ALL THE ABOVE-MENTIONED ARTICLES CONSTITUTE PARTS OF BALL-POINT PENS FOR WHICH THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF CONTAINS A SPECIAL SUBHEADING , NAMELY SUBHEADING 98.C II , AND THAT THE SECOND SENTENCE OF GENERAL RULE ( A ) IS THEREFORE NOT APPLICABLE TO THEM . THE PLAINTIFF RELIES ON THE GERMAN VERSION OF THAT PROVISION WHICH , UNLIKE THE VERSIONS IN ALL THE OTHER LANGUAGES OF THE COMMUNITY , DOES NOT REFER TO THE ' ' UNASSEMBLED OR DISASSEMBLED ' '  ARTICLE BUT ONLY TO THE ' ' DISASSEMBLED ' '  ( ' ' ZERLEGT ' ' ) ARTICLE ; THE PLAINTIFF THEREFORE CLAIMS IN PARTICULAR THAT SINCE THE ARTICLES IN QUESTION ARE ASSEMBLED IN THE FORM OF BALL-POINT PENS ONLY AFTER THEIR IMPORTATION INTO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY THEY CANNOT CONSTITUTE ' ' DISASSEMBLED ' '  ARTICLES WITHIN THE MEANING OF GENERAL RULE ( A ).   6THE QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY THE NATIONAL COURT REQUIRE THE FOLLOWING ANSWER .   7WITH REGARD TO QUESTION AND , TARIFF HEADING 98.COVERS ON THE ONE HAND COMPLETE ARTICLES SUCH AS FOUNTAIN-PENS AND STYLOGRAPH PENS , AND , ON THE OTHER , ' ' PARTS AND FITTINGS ' ' . IT IS CLEAR FROM THE GENERAL PLAN OF THAT HEADING AND FROM THE VERY CONCEPT OF ' ' PARTS AND FITTINGS ' '  THAT THAT TARIFF CATEGORY IMPLIES THE EXISTENCE , EVEN IF POSSIBLY ONLY IN THE FUTURE , OF A COMPLETE ARTICLE OF WHICH SUCH PIECES ARE FITTINGS OR PARTS . IT FOLLOWS THAT , GIVEN THE EXISTENCE OF THE CONSTITUENT PARTS , DISASSEMBLED OR NOT YET ASSEMBLED , OF A COMPLETE ARTICLE , SUCH PARTS CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED AS ' ' PARTS AND FITTINGS ' ' , WITHIN THE MEANING OF SUBHEADING 98.C II , IN RESPECT OF THE COMPLETE ARTICLE OF WHICH THEY FORM THE TOTALITY OF THE COMPONENTS .   8THE REPLY TO THE FIRST TWO QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY THE NATIONAL COURT MUST THEREFORE BE THAT GENERAL RULE ( A ) FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF THE NOMENCLATURE OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF COVERS ARTICLES NOT YET ASSEMBLED AS WELL AS ARTICLES WHICH HAVE BEEN DISASSEMBLED AND TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PARTS NOT YET ASSEMBLED ALLOW OF THE ASSEMBLY OF A COMPLETE ARTICLE THEY ARE COVERED BY THE PROVISIONS GOVERNING THAT ARTICLE EVEN THOUGH THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF CONTAINS A SPECIFIC HEADING FOR PARTS AND FITTINGS .   9QUESTION IS INTENDED TO SETTLE A SPECIAL DIFFICULTY ARISING FROM THE FACT THAT IN A LARGE CONSIGNMENT OF PARTS OF A GIVEN ARTICLE WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN ASSEMBLED THERE IS NO CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN ANY ONE OF SUCH PARTS AND ANY OTHER , SO THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH WHICH , WHEN PUT TOGETHER , WILL ULTIMATELY FORM THE FINISHED ARTICLE .   10IN SUCH A SITUATION , SINCE STANDARD AND INTERCHANGEABLE PARTS ARE CONCERNED , ONLY THOSE PARTS WHICH MAY BE ASSEMBLED TO FORM THE FINISHED ARTICLE MUST BE CLASSIFIED UNDER THE TARIFF HEADING FOR THAT ARTICLE WHILST ANY SURPLUS MUST THUS BE COVERED BY THE CONCEPT OF ' ' PARTS AND FITTINGS ' ' . THE REPLY TO QUESTION MUST THEREFORE BE THAT WHEN UNASSEMBLED PARTS OF AN ARTICLE ARE PRESENTED FOR CUSTOMS CLEARANCE ONLY ANY SURPLUS PARTS NOT ALLOWING OF THE ASSEMBLY OF A COMPLETE ARTICLE ARE TO BE REGARDED AS ' ' PARTS AND FITTINGS ' '  OF THE SAID ARTICLE WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF .
