Subject of the case
APPLICATION CONCERNING THE GRANT OF AN EXPATRIATION ALLOWANCE PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) OF ANNEX VII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , 
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON NOVEMBER , CLAUDE RICHTER , A LUXEMBOURG NATIONAL , WHO HAS BEEN AN OFFICIAL OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES SINCE APRIL AND WHOSE PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT IS LUXEMBOURG , BROUGHT AN ACTION ESSENTIALLY FOR THE GRANT OF AN EXPATRIATION ALLOWANCE PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) OF ANNEX VII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES .  ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) PROVIDES THAT AN EXPATRIATION ALLOWANCE IS TO BE PAID   ' TO OFFICIALS WHO ARE OR WHO HAVE BEEN NATIONALS OF THE STATE IN WHOSE TERRITORY THE PLACE WHERE THEY ARE EMPLOYED IS SITUATED BUT WHO DURING THE YEARS ENDING AT THE DATE OF THEIR ENTERING THE SERVICE HABITUALLY RESIDED OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN TERRITORY OF THAT STATE FOR REASONS OTHER THAN THE PERFORMANCE OF DUTIES IN THE SERVICE OF A STATE OR OF AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION ' .  MR RICHTER WAS BORN IN IN LUXEMBOURG , WHERE HE LIVED UNTIL OCTOBER . FROM OCTOBER UNTIL OCTOBER HE RESIDED IN STRASBOURG FOR THE PURPOSES OF HIS STUDIES . FROM OCTOBER UNTIL MAY HIS NAME WAS ENTERED WITHOUT INTERRUPTION IN THE POPULATION REGISTER OF GERMERSHEIM IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY . DURING THE PERIOD FROM OCTOBER UNTIL MARCH THE APPLICANT STUDIED LANGUAGES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MAINZ . BETWEEN SEPTEMBER AND APRIL HE WORKED AS A FREELANCE TRANSLATOR AT GERMERSHEIM AND BETWEEN SEPTEMBER AND FEBRUARY HE WAS ALSO A TRAINEE WITH THE TERMINOLOGY DIVISION OF THE COMMISSION IN LUXEMBOURG AND , BETWEEN MARCH AND APRIL HE WAS A FREELANCE TRANSLATOR FOR THE COMMISSION IN LUXEMBOURG . ON HIS APPLICATION FORM FOR A POST WITH THE COMMISSION IN LUXEMBOURG , HE STATED THAT BOTH HIS PERMANENT ADDRESS AND HIS ADDRESS FOR CORRESPONDENCE WERE IN LUXEMBOURG . HIS JUDICIAL RECORD , INCLUDED IN HIS PERSONNEL FILE AND DATED MARCH , REFERS TO HIM AS ' LIVING IN LUXEMBOURG ' .  REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING FOR A MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FACTS OF THE CASE AND FOR THE ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES .  THE APPLICANT SUBMITS THAT THE COMMISSION INFRINGED ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) OF ANNEX VII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS BY NOT GRANTING HIM AN EXPATRIATION ALLOWANCE .  THAT SUBMISSION CANNOT BE ACCEPTED . THE COURT HAS REPEATEDLY HELD THAT THE OBJECT OF THE EXPATRIATION ALLOWANCE IS TO COMPENSATE OFFICIALS FOR THE EXTRA EXPENSE AND INCONVENIENCE OF TAKING UP EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMMUNITIES AND BEING THEREBY OBLIGED TO CHANGE THEIR RESIDENCE AND MOVE TO THE COUNTRY OF EMPLOYMENT ( SEE JUDGMENT OF MAY IN CASE 246/DE ANGELIS V COMMISSION ( ) ECR ). FURTHERMORE , THE CONCEPT OF EXPATRIATION ALSO DEPENDS ON THE PERSONAL SITUATION OF AN OFFICIAL , NOTABLY WHETHER , ALTHOUGH HE IS A NATIONAL OF THE MEMBER STATE OF THE PLACE OF HIS EMPLOYMENT , HE HAS ACTUALLY BROKEN HIS SOCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL TIES WITH THAT STATE BY MOVING COMPLETELY AND ON A LONG-TERM BASIS HIS HABITUAL RESIDENCE OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN TERRITORY OF THAT STATE . THE EXCEPTION PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) OF ANNEX VII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS COVERS ONLY PERSONS WHO HAD TO MOVE THEIR PERMANENT CENTRE OF INTERESTS OUTSIDE THE STATE WHERE THEY ARE EMPLOYED BY THE COMMUNITY AND CAN THEREFORE BE REGARDED AS NO LONGER HAVING PERMANENT LINKS WITH THAT STATE .  IN THIS CASE , IT IS CLEAR FROM THE APPLICANT ' S OWN STATEMENTS THAT HE DID NOT SEVER HIS LASTING LINKS WITH LUXEMBOURG . IN HIS APPLICATION FORM HE GAVE LUXEMBOURG BOTH AS HIS PERMANENT ADDRESS AND AS HIS ADDRESS FOR CORRESPONDENCE . MOREOVER , HE WORKED FOR MONTHS BETWEEN SEPTEMBER AND APRIL AT THE COMMISSION IN LUXEMBOURG , INITIALLY AS A TRAINEE AND SUBSEQUENTLY AS A FREELANCE TRANSLATOR .  IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THE FACT THAT THE APPLICANT STUDIED IN STRASBOURG FROM OCTOBER TO OCTOBER AND LIVED IN GERMANY FROM OCTOBER TO MAY IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO PROVE THAT HE HABITUALLY RESIDED OUTSIDE LUXEMBOURG DURING THE YEARS PRECEDING THE DATE OF HIS ENTERING THE SERVICE OF THE COMMISSION . DURING THAT PERIOD HE NEVER ACTUALLY SEVERED HIS SOCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL TIES WITH LUXEMBOURG NOR DID HE MOVE HIS PERMANENT CENTRE OF INTERESTS OUTSIDE THAT STATE .  THE APPLICATION MUST THEREFORE BE DISMISSED .
