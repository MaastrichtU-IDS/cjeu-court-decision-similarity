Re: 
Preliminary ruling – Bundesfinanzhof – Interpretation of Articles EC, 57(1) EC and EC – Deduction from the taxable profits
                  of a German company of losses resulting from the activity of a permanent establishment in a non-member country – Deduction
                  refused on the basis of a bilateral double taxation convention concluded with that non-member country.
               
Operative part: 
A national system of taxation under which a company having its head office in a Member State, when determining its results,
         cannot deduct losses incurred by an establishment in a non-Member State fundamentally affects the exercise of the freedom
         of establishment within the meaning of Articles EC to EC. Those provisions cannot be relied upon in a situation involving
         such an establishment in a non-Member State.
