IN CASE 125/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE HESSISCHES FINANZGERICHT ( FINANCE COURT , HESSE ) FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN :    FIRMA PETER CREMER , HAMBURG ,   AND  BUNDESANSTALT FUR LANDWIRTSCHAFTLICHE MARKTORDNUNG ( FEDERAL OFFICE FOR AGRICULTURAL MARKET ORGANIZATION ), FRANKFURT AM MAIN ,   
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION AND VALIDITY OF REGULATION NO 166/OF THE COUNCIL OF OCTOBER ON THE SYSTEM APPLICABLE TO CERTAIN CLASSES OF COMPOUND ANIMAL FEEDING-STUFFS AND ON THE INTERPRETATION OF REGULATION NO 171/OF THE COMMISSION OF OCTOBER LAYING DOWN THE CONDITIONS FOR THE GRANT OF REFUNDS ON THE EXPORT TO THIRD COUNTRIES OF CERTAIN CLASSES OF COMPOUND FEEDING-STUFFS , 
Grounds
BY ORDER DATED DECEMBER RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON DECEMBER THE HESSISCHES FINANZGERICHT SUBMITTED TO THE COURT FOUR QUESTIONS ON THE INTERPRETATION OF REGULATION NO 166/OF THE COUNCIL OF OCTOBER ON THE SYSTEM APPLICABLE TO CERTAIN CLASSES OF COMPOUND ANIMAL FEEDING-STUFFS ( JOURNAL OFFICIEL , P . ) AND REGULATION NO 171/OF THE COMMISSION OF OCTOBER LAYING DOWN THE CONDITIONS FOR THE GRANT OF REFUNDS ON EXPORTS TO THIRD COUNTRIES OF CERTAIN CLASSES OF COMPOUND FEEDING-STUFFS ( JOURNAL OFFICIEL , P . ) AND A QUESTION ON THE VALIDITY OF THE AFORESAID REGULATION NO 166/.  BEFORE THE QUESTIONS PUT BY THE NATIONAL COURT ARE CONSIDERED IT APPEARS APPROPRIATE TO SET OUT THE PROVISIONS OF COMMUNITY LAW RELEVANT TO THE CASE .   ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO OF THE COUNCIL OF APRIL ON THE PROGRESSIVE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN CEREALS ( JOURNAL OFFICIEL , P . ) EMPOWERED THE COUNCIL TO INTRODUCE A SYSTEM OF REFUNDS ON EXPORT TO THIRD COUNTRIES OF PREPARATIONS OF FEEDING-STUFFS CONTAINING CEREALS OR OTHER PRODUCTS COMING UNDER THAT REGULATION .  ARTICLES ( ) AND ( ) OF REGULATION NO 13/OF THE COUNCIL OF FEBRUARY ON THE PROGRESSIVE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS ( JOURNAL OFFICIEL , P . ) CONTAINED SIMILAR PROVISIONS ON THE GRANT OF REFUNDS ON THE EXPORT OF PREPARATIONS OF FEEDING-STUFFS CONTAINING MILK POWDER OR CERTAIN OTHER MILK PRODUCTS .   ON THE BASIS OF THOSE PROVISIONS REGULATION NO 166/OF THE COUNCIL DETERMINED THE SYSTEM APPLYING TO THE IMPORT AND EXPORT OF CERTAIN CLASSES OF COMPOUND FEEDING-STUFFS . ARTICLE OF THAT REGULATION DEFINES SUCH COMPOUND FEEDING-STUFFS BY REFERENCE TO CERTAIN SUBHEADINGS OF HEADING NO 23.OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF WHICH AT THE TIME READ AS FOLLOWS :   SWEETENED FORAGE ; OTHER PREPARATIONS OF A KIND USED IN ANIMAL FEEDING . . .  B : OTHER . . .  - CONTAINING NOT LESS THAN % BY WEIGHT OF POWDERED MILK ;  OTHER :   - CONTAINING CEREALS OR PRODUCTS TO WHICH REGULATION NO APPLIES . . .  ARTICLE OF THE REGULATION PROVIDES THAT THE MEMBER STATES MAY IN TRADE WITH THIRD COUNTRIES GRANT A REFUND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT IN PARTICULAR ' THE SITUATION OF THE WORLD MARKET AND THE MARKET PRICES OF THE PRODUCTS RELEVANT FOR THE COMPUTATION OF THE VARIABLE COMPONENT ' ; ACCORDING TO THE FIRST INDENT OF ARTICLE THAT REGULATION , WHICH GOVERNS THE COMPUTATION OF THE ' VARIABLE COMPONENT '  THE PRODUCTS ARE MAIZE , BARLEY AND SORGHUM . ARTICLE ( ) PROVIDES THAT THE DETAILED IMPLEMENTING PROVISIONS ON THE GRANT OF THE REFUND ON EXPORT TO THIRD COUNTRIES SHOULD BE ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION ACCORDING TO THE SO-CALLED ' MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE PROCEDURE ' .   ON THAT BASIS REGULATION NO 171/WAS ADOPTED . FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF REFUND ARTICLE MAKES REFERENCE TO THE REFUND WHICH IS GRANTED ON THE EXPORT OF THE ' THREE KINDS OF CEREALS ON THE BASIS OF THE QUANTITIES USED FOR THE COMPUTATION OF THE VARIABLE COMPONENT '  MULTIPLIED ' BY THE COEFFICIENT SHOWN IN COLUMN OF TABLE A OF THE ANNEX TO REGULATION NO 166/CORRESPONDING TO THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE COMPOUND FEEDING-STUFF ' , THE COEFFICIENT BEING DETERMINED ON THE BASIS OF THE ' STARCH CONTENT ' .   IT APPEARS FROM THE ORDER REFERRING THE MATTER TO THE COURT THAT BETWEEN DECEMBER AND MARCH THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION EXPORTED TO DENMARK ANIMAL FEEDING-STUFFS CONSISTING OF % TAPIOCA CHIPS , % BROKEN SOYA , % MINERAL MATTER AND % TAPIOCA FLOUR , THOUGH THERE IS NO AGREEMENT ABOUT THE ADDITION OF THE LAST-MENTIONED INGREDIENT . IT IS NOT CONTESTED THAT THIS FEEDING-STUFF , APART FROM THE TAPIOCA FLOUR , CONSISTED OF PRODUCTS NOT COMING UNDER REGULATION NO 19/. IT IS ALSO AGREED THAT THE STARCH CONTENT OF THE FEEDING-STUFF ON EXPORT WAS MORE THAN % IN ALL CASES .   AT FIRST THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION RECEIVED FROM THE GERMAN AUTHORITY , THE DEFENDANT IN THE MAIN ACTION , FOR THE EXPORT OF THE FEEDING-STUFF SO MADE UP THE REFUNDS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMMUNITY RULES IN THE FORM OF LICENCES FOR THE IMPORT FREE FROM THE LEVY OF AN EQUIVALENT QUANTITY OF MAIZE , BARLY AND SORGHUM . THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES SUBSEQUENTLY ESTABLISHED THAT THE GREATER PART OF THE TAPIOCA CHIPS HAD BEEN SEGREGATED FROM THE PRODUCT BY SIFTING AFTER THE IMPORT OF THE FEEDING-STUFF INTO DENMARK AND HAD BEEN REIMPORTED INTO THE COMMUNITY ; THEREUPON THE DEFENDANT IN THE MAIN ACTION BY NOTICE DATED SEPTEMBER REVOKED THE IMPORT LICENCES GRANTED IN PLACE OF THE REFUNDS . THAT NOTICE IS THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF THE MAIN ACTION .  THE FIRST QUESTION   THE FIRST QUESTION ASKS WHETHER REGULATION NO 171/OF THE COMMISSION ALSO APPLIES TO COMPOUND ANIMAL FEEDING-STUFFS WITHOUT THE ADDITION OF POWDERED MILK .   THE REASON FOR THIS QUESTION IS THAT REGULATION NO 171/( LIKE REGULATION NO 166/OF THE COUNCIL ON WHICH IT IS BASED ) IS FOUNDED BOTH ON REGULATION NO RELATING TO THE CEREAL MARKET AND REGULATION NO 13/RELATING TO THE MILK MARKET SO THAT DOUBTS MIGHT ARISE AS TO WHETHER THE FEEDING-STUFF REFERRED TO IN THE REGULATION OF THE COMMISSION MUST CONTAIN IN ANY CASE PRODUCTS OF BOTH OF THOSE MARKETS . THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION MUST BE SOUGHT IN THE DEFINITION OF ' ANIMAL FEEDING-STUFF '  CONTAINED IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 166/WHICH AS MENTIONED REFERS TO PARTICULAR SUBHEADINGS OF HEADING NO 23.OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF . IT IS CLEAR FROM THE CONTEXT OF THOSE SUBHEADINGS THAT THE RULES RELATE TO VARIOUS CLASSES OF FEEDING-STUFFS , NAMELY SUCH AS CONTAIN NOT LESS THAN % BY WEIGHT OF POWDERED MILK AND SUCH AS CONTAIN CEREALS OR OTHER PRODUCTS TO WHICH REGULATION NO APPLIES .   THE ANSWER MUST THEREFORE BE THAT REGULATION NO 171/OF THE COMMISSION APPLIES ALSO TO COMPOUND ANIMAL FEEDING-STUFFS NOT CONTAINING POWDERED MILK .  SECOND AND THIRD QUESTIONS   THE SECOND QUESTION ASKS WHETHER THE WORDS IN ARTICLE ( A ) THEREOF ' FOR EACH OF THE THREE KINDS OF CEREALS ON THE BASIS OF THE QUANTITIES USED '  ARE TO BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT ( A ) ONLY A PRODUCT IN THE PREPARATION OF WHICH CEREALS HAD IN FACT TO BE USED OR ( B ) WHETHER THE EXPRESSION ' THE QUANTITIES USED '  ARE TO BE REGARDED AS NOTIONAL FOR CALCULATING THE AMOUNT OF CEREALS TO BE TAKEN AS THE BASIS FOR THE REFUND ( IN THE SAME WAY AS IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 166/OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE CHARGING OF THE LEVY ). THE THIRD QUESTION , WHICH IS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVIOUS QUESTION , ASKS WHETHER WITH REFERENCE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF GRANTING A REFUND FOR COMPOUND ANIMAL FEEDING-STUFFS ( ARTICLE ( D ) OF AND THE ANNEX TO REGULATION NO 19/OF THE COUNCIL ; ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 166/OF THE COUNCIL ) IT DEPENDED UPON THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE ANIMAL FEEDING-STUFF ' CONTAINED PRODUCTS '  TO WHICH REGULATION NO APPLIED AND , IN PARTICULAR , WHETHER THE ADMIXTURE OF % OF A PRODUCT UPON WHICH A LEVY WAS CHARGEABLE , SUCH AS TAPIOCA FLOUR , SUFFICES TO DEMAND IN THIS WAY A REFUND AMOUNTING TO % EXEMPTION FROM THE LEVY FOR IMPORTS OF CEREALS FROM THIRD COUNTRIES . BASICALLY BOTH QUESTIONS ARE CONCERNED WITH THE QUESTION WHETHER EXPORT REFUNDS ON COMPOUND ANIMAL FEEDING-STUFFS MUST BEAR A PARTICULAR RELATIONSHIP TO THE PROPORTION IN THE MIXTURE OF PRODUCTS COMING UNDER REGULATION NO OR WHETHER IT MUST BE REGARDED AS SUFFICIENT FOR THE GRANT OF THE FULL REFUND IF ONLY ONE PRODUCT COMING UNDER THAT REGULATION IS CONTAINED THEREIN AND THAT ONLY IN A VERY SMALL PROPORTION ( FOR EXAMPLE % ).   THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION CLAIMS THAT REGULATIONS NOS 166/AND 171/MEAN THAT THE FULL REFUND MUST BE GRANTED WHENEVER A COMPOUND FEEDING-STUFF CONTAINS AN INGREDIENT COMING UNDER THE COMMUNITY RULES NO MATTER WHAT THE AMOUNT IS . THE COMMISSION SUPPORTS THIS VIEW AND CONSIDERS THAT THE SAID PROVISIONS CONTAIN A ' MODEL CALCULATION '  FOR DETERMINING THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF REFUND AND LAY DOWN NO REQUIREMENTS REGARDING THE ACTUAL COMPOSITION OF THE COMPOUND FEEDING-STUFFS . ALTHOUGH THE DEFENDANT IN THE MAIN ACTION ADMITS THAT THE MANNER OF COMPUTATION IS DETERMINED BY REGULATIONS NOS 166/AND 171/ON A FLAT-RATE AND LARGELY FICTITIOUS BASIS , IT NEVERTHELESS TAKES THE VIEW THAT THE APPLICATION OF THOSE PROVISIONS CANNOT BE EXTENDED TO ABUSIVE PRACTICES INVOLVING CLAIMS FOR THE PAYMENT OF REFUNDS FOR THE EXPORT OF COMPOUND FEEDING-STUFFS CONTAINING ONLY A VERY SMALL PROPORTION OF ONE OF THE PRODUCTS COMING UNDER THE COMMUNITY RULES RELATING TO THE CEREAL MARKET .   ALTHOUGH THE PROVISIONS OF THE REGULATIONS REFERRED TO BY THE NATIONAL COURT ARE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THEIR WORDING AND CONTEXT , THEY MAY BE SATISFACTORILY INTERPRETED HAVING REGARD TO THE OBJECTIVES OF THE SYSTEM OF EXPORT REFUNDS AS IS EXPRESSED IN THE PREAMBLE TO REGULATION NO 171/. ACCORDING TO THE FIRST RECITAL IN THE PREAMBLE TO THAT REGULATION REFUNDS ARE INTENDED ' TO MAKE UP FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRICES WITHIN THE EXPORTING MEMBER STATE AND THOSE ON THE WORLD MARKET ' . IT CONTINUES : ' THAT DIFFERENCE MAY BE PROPERLY ASSESSED FOR THE MEMBER STATES ON THE BASIS OF THAT APPLYING TO THE BASIC PRODUCTS . ACCORDINGLY THE REFUND MUST BE CALCULATED FOR THOSE PRODUCTS ON THE BASIS OF THAT WHICH APPLIES TO THEIR BASIC INGREDIENTS AND IN PROPORTIONS VARYING ACCORDING TO THE QUANTITIES INVOLVED ' . IT APPEARS CLEARLY FROM THESE RECITALS THAT THE OBJECTIVE OF THE REFUND ON EXPORT TO THIRD COUNTRIES IS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE EFFECT ON THE PRICES OF THE COMPOUND FEEDING-STUFFS OF THE RULES APPLICABLE TO THE INGREDIENTS USED .   FROM THIS IT FOLLOWS , AS THE PREAMBLE TO REGULATION NO 171/STRESSES , THAT THE REFUND MUST BE PROPORTIONATE TO THE AMOUNT OF THE BASIC PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO AN ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE COMPOUND FEEDING-STUFFS . ALTHOUGH IN FIXING THE AMOUNT OF THE REFUND THE APPLICATION OF FLAT-RATE METHODS OF CALCULATION CANNOT BE AVOIDED , THE GRANT OF A REFUND ALWAYS PRESUPPOSES THE ACTUAL PRESENCE IN THE COMPOUND FEEDING-STUFF , IN SIGNIFICANT PROPORTIONS , OF PRODUCTS COMING UNDER REGULATION NO ( CEREALS ) OR REGULATION NO 13/( MILK PRODUCTS ). SINCE REGULATION NOS . 166/AND 171/DO NOT GIVE MORE PRECISE INDICATION OF THE CRITERIA FOR DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN COMPOUND FEEDING-STUFFS , THE EXPORT OF WHICH GIVES RISE TO AN ENTITLEMENT TO THE GRANT OF REFUNDS AND THOSE FOR WHICH IT DOES NOT , IT IS FOR THE COMPETENT NATIONAL AUTHORITIES TO JUDGE THE FACTS WITH A VIEW TO PREVENTING UNDUE PAYMENT OF REFUNDS AS A RESULT OF MANIPULATION BY THE PRODUCERS OF THE PROPORTION OF THE INGREDIENTS OF COMPOUND ANIMAL FEEDING-STUFFS . IT APPEARS IN ANY EVENT CLEAR THAT A COMPOUND FEEDING-STUFF WHICH CONTAINS ONLY ONE PRODUCT COMING UNDER REGULATION NO AND THAT IN INSIGNIFICANT PROPORTIONS CANNOT GIVE RISE TO A CLAIM FOR A REFUND .   THE QUESTIONS REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING SHOULD THEREFORE BE ANSWERED TO THE EFFECT THAT APART FROM COMPOUND FEEDING-STUFFS CONTAINING NOT LESS THAN % BY WEIGHT OF POWDERED MILK , A REFUND ON THE EXPORT OF A COMPOUND FEEDING-STUFF ON THE BASIS OF REGULATION NO 166/OF THE COUNCIL AND REGULATION NO 171/OF THE COMMISSION CAN BE GRANTED ONLY WHERE CEREALS OR PRODUCTS TO WHICH REGULATION NO APPLIES ARE IN FACT CONTAINED IN THE MIXTURE IN SIGNIFICANT PROPORTIONS .  THE FOURTH QUESTION   THE FOURTH QUESTION ASKS WHETHER THE COEFFICIENTS WHICH , PURSUANT TO ARTICLE , TOGETHER WITH ARTICLE OF TABLE A OF THE ANNEX TO REGULATION NO 166/, ARE TO BE APPLIED ACCORDING TO THE STARCH CONTENT OF THE ANIMAL FEEDING-STUFF WITH DUE REGARD TO ARTICLE THEREOF ( ' CEREALS . . . ACTUALLY USED IN COMPOUND FEEDING-STUFFS ' ) ARE TO BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT THE STARCH CONTENT OF A PRODUCT WHICH DETERMINES THE COEFFICIENT HAD TO BE DERIVED FROM PRODUCTS TO WHICH REGULATION NO 19/APPLIED .   IT IS APPARENT FROM THE VERY HEADING OF TABLE A : ' PREPARATIONS CONTAINING CEREALS OR PRODUCTS TO WHICH REGULATION NO OR REGULATION NO 16/( EEC ) APPLIES ' , TAKEN IN TURN FROM TARIFF HEADING NO 23., THAT THE SYSTEM OF EXPORT REFUNDS APPLIES , SUBJECT TO WHAT HAS BEEN SAID IN ANSWER TO THE SECOND AND THIRD QUESTIONS , TO ALL PREPARATIONS CONTAINING CEREALS AND OTHER PRODUCTS FALLING UNDER REGULATION NO , NO MATTER WHAT THE PROPORTIONS . THIS PROVISION RELATES TO ' PREPARATIONS '  AS SUCH AND NOT SIMPLY TO CERTAIN OF THEIR INGREDIENTS . THE WORDS ' CEREALS '  . . . ACTUALLY USED IN THE PRODUCT ' , WHICH THE NATIONAL COURT HAS TAKEN FROM ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 166/MUST BE REGARDED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SPECIAL PURPOSE OF THAT ARTICLE , WHICH IS INTENDED TO APPLY ONLY WHERE THERE ARE DISTURBANCES OF THE MARKET . THE USE OF THESE WORDS IN THIS QUITE SPECIAL CONNEXION THEREFORE CONFIRMS THAT FOR OTHER PURPOSES THE PROVISIONS OF REGULATION NO 166/AND OF ANNEX A THERETO ARE APPLICABLE WITHOUT ITS BEING NECESSARY TO DISTINGUISH , FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THE STARCH CONTENT , BETWEEN THE INGREDIENTS OF A COMPOUND FEEDING-STUFF COMING UNDER REGULATION NO AND OTHER INGREDIENTS .   THE ANSWER SHOULD THEREFORE BE THAT FOR THE PURPOSES OF APPLYING THE COEFFICIENTS LAID DOWN BY ANNEX A TO REGULATION NO 166/THE STARCH CONTENT OF THE PREPARATIONS REFERRED TO THEREIN MUST BE CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF THE COMPOUND FEEDING-STUFF AS A WHOLE AND NOT SIMPLY WITH REGARD TO THE INGREDIENTS TO WHICH REGULATION NO WAS APPLICABLE .  THE FIFTH QUESTION   THE FIFTH QUESTION ASKS WHETHER THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF REGULATION NO 166/ARE NOT INVALID TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY FIX FOR PRODUCTS LISTED UNDER TARIFF HEADING NO 23.OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF A STANDARD REFUND APPLICABLE IRRESPECTIVE OF THE QUANTITY WHETHER NEGLIGIBLE OR SUBSTANTIAL OF PRODUCTS UPON WHICH THE LEVY IS CHARGEABLE CONTAINED IN THOSE PRODUCTS ( AS THE COURT RULED IN ITS JUDGMENT OF MARCH IN RESPECT OF A REGULATION FIXING A LEVY ).   THE REFERENCE BY THE FINANZGERICHT TO THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF MARCH ( CASE 95/EFFEM V HAUPTZOLLAMT LUNEBURG ( ) ECR ) SHOWS THAT THE COURT MAKING THE REFERENCE HAS DOUBTS ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF REGULATION NO 166/SINCE IT MIGHT LEAD TO THE GRANT OF UNJUSTIFIED ADVANTAGES SINCE IN CALCULATING THE EXPORT REFUNDS IT MAKES NO DISTINCTION ACCORDING TO WHETHER THE INGREDIENTS OF A COMPOUND FEEDING-STUFF FALL UNDER THE AGRICULTURAL RULES OF THE COMMUNITY OR NOT .   WITH REGARD TO THESE DOUBTS IT SHOULD BE OBSERVED THAT THE COUNCIL , HAVING REGARD TO THE SPECIAL NATURE OF THE PRODUCTS IN QUESTION , HAD NECESSARILY TO HAVE RECOURSE , SO AS TO ENSURE THAT THE RULES WERE PRACTICABLE , TO APPROXIMATE AND FLAT-RATE METHODS OF FIXING . FURTHER , IT APPEARS FROM THE ANSWERS TO THE SECOND AND THIRD QUESTIONS THAT THE SCOPE OF REGULATION NO 166/AND REGULATION NO 171/MUST IN NO CASE BE EXTENDED TO COVER ABUSIVE PRACTICES OF AN EXPORTER IN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE FLAT-RATE ASSESSMENT IN CALCULATING THE REFUNDS ESPECIALLY AS AT THE TIME IT WAS NOT A QUESTION OF ADOPTING A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF RULES BUT ONLY OF CREATING A FRAME-WORK WITHIN WHICH THE NATIONAL AUTHORITIES WERE TO REGULATE THE MARKET FOR THE PRODUCTS IN QUESTION AT THEIR OWN DISCRETION .   IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE VALIDITY OF REGULATION NO 166/IS NOT OPEN TO CHALLENGE .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , WHICH HAS SUBMITTED OBSERVATIONS TO THE COURT , ARE NOT RECOVERABLE AND AS THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE , IN SO FAR AS THE PARTIES TO THE MAIN ACTION ARE CONCERNED , IN THE NATURE OF A STEP IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THE HESSISCHES FINANZGERICHT , THE DECISION ON COSTS IS A MATTER FOR THAT COURT .  
Operative part
