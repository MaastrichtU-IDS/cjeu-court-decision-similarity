                  (EC) No 1400/of July on the application of Article 81(3) of the Treaty to categories of vertical agreements and
                  concerted practices in the motor vehicle sector (OJ L 203, p. 30) – Termination of a distribution agreement by the supplier
                  on one year’s notice on the ground that reorganisation of the whole or a substantial part of the network is needed owing to
                  the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1400/2002.
               
Operative Part
 
The entry into force of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1400/of July on the application of Article 81(3) of the
                     Treaty to categories of vertical agreements and concerted practices in the motor vehicle sector does not in itself make it
                     necessary to reorganise the distribution network of a supplier within the meaning of the first indent of the first subparagraph
                     of Article 5(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1475/of June on the application of Article [81](3) of the Treaty
                     to certain categories of motor vehicle distribution and servicing agreements. However, that entry into force may, in relation
                     to the specific organisation of the distribution network of each supplier, necessitate changes that are so substantial that
                     they constitute a real reorganisation of the network within the meaning of that provision.
                  
 
The putting in place by a supplier after the entry into force of Regulation No 1400/of a selective distribution system
                     under which, first, the dealers are no longer restricted to a territory on which they may sell the contractual goods and,
                     secondly, the authorised repairers may limit their activities to only providing repair and maintenance services is capable
                     of constituting a reorganisation of the distribution network within the meaning of first indent of the first subparagraph
                     of Article 5(3) of Regulation No 1475/95. It is for the national courts or arbitrators to determine whether that is the case,
                     in the light of all the evidence in the specific case and, in particular, of the evidence submitted to this end by the supplier.
