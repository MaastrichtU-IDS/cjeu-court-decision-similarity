APPLICATION PRINCIPALLY FOR AN INTERIM ORDER THAT THE DEFENDANTS SHOULD PRODUCE TO THE COURT ALL THE DOCUMENTS IN THEIR POSSESSION CONCERNING COUNCIL DECISION NO 86/OF MARCH TERMINATING THE ANTI-DUMPING PROCEEDING CONCERNING IMPORTS OF DEAD-BURNED ( SINTERED ) NATURAL MAGNESITE ORIGINATING IN THE PEOPLE ' S REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND NORTH KOREA ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ) AND THAT THEIR AGENTS SHOULD DECLARE UNDER OATH THAT NO OTHER DOCUMENTS EXIST , 
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON MAY , THE HELLENIC REPUBLIC BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT DECISION 86/OF MARCH BY WHICH THE COUNCIL TERMINATED THE ANTI-DUMPING PROCEEDING CONCERNING IMPORTS OF DEAD-BURNED NATURAL MAGNESITE ORIGINATING IN THE PEOPLE ' S REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND NORTH KOREA ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ) AND ANY PRECEDING OR SUCCEEDING ACT CONNECTED THEREWITH ARE VOID .  BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JUNE , THE APPLICANT APPLIED UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY AND ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE FOR INTERIM RELIEF IN THE FORM OF AN ORDER THAT THE DEFENDANTS SHOULD PRODUCE ALL THE DOCUMENTS RELATING TO COUNCIL DECISION 86/AND THAT THEIR AGENTS SHOULD DECLARE UNDER OATH THAT THEY HAVE NO OTHER DOCUMENTS .  THE DEFENDANTS SUBMITTED THEIR WRITTEN OBSERVATIONS ON JUNE . THE PARTIES PRESENTED ORAL ARGUMENT ON JUNE .   BEFORE CONSIDERING WHETHER THE PRESENT APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES IS WELL-FOUNDED , IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE USEFUL TO RECALL TO MIND BRIEFLY THE VARIOUS STAGES IN THE ANTI-DUMPING PROCEEDING WHICH PRECEDED THE ADOPTION BY THE COUNCIL OF DECISION 86/.   IN JUNE , THE COMMISSION RECEIVED A COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE OF COUNCIL REGULATION NO 3017/OF DECEMBER ON PROTECTION AGAINST DUMPED OR SUBSIDIZED IMPORTS FROM COUNTRIES NOT MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ) LODGED BY FIVE GREEK UNDERTAKINGS WHOSE COLLECTIVE OUTPUT CONSTITUTED AT THAT TIME ALL COMMUNITY PRODUCTION OF DEAD-BURNED NATURAL MAGNESITE , ALLEGING THAT DUMPING WAS BEING PRACTISED IN RESPECT OF IMPORTS OF THAT PRODUCT ORIGINATING IN THE PEOPLE ' S REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND IN NORTH KOREA .  SINCE THE COMMISSION CONSIDERED THAT THE COMPLAINT CONTAINED SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF DUMPING AND OF MATERIAL INJURY RESULTING THEREFROM , IT ANNOUNCED , IN A NOTICE OF JUNE , THE INITIATION OF AN ANTI-DUMPING PROCEDURE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL C , P . ) AND UNDERTOOK THE NECESSARY INQUIRIES IN THAT REGARD .  SINCE THE COMMISSION ' S PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION SUCCEEDED IN ESTABLISHING THAT THE COMMUNITY PRODUCTS AND THE IMPORTED PRODUCTS SHOULD BE REGARDED AS LIKE PRODUCTS AND IN REVEALING THE EXISTENCE OF A DUMPING PRACTICE WITH A MARGIN OF 114% IN RESPECT OF THE PRODUCTS ORIGINATING IN THE PEOPLE ' S REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND 85% IN THE CASE OF THE PRODUCT ORIGINATING IN NORTH KOREA AS WELL AS VARIOUS FACTORS REVEALING THE EXISTENCE OF INJURY , SUCH AS , IN PARTICULAR , A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN THE MARKET SHARE HELD BY THE GREEK PRODUCERS OF THAT PRODUCT WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AND A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE MARKET SHARE HELD BY THE CHINESE AND NORTH KOREAN PRODUCTS , A 47% DROP IN THE SALES OF COMMUNITY PRODUCTS AND A DROP IN THE AVERAGE UTILIZATION OF PRODUCTION CAPACITY FROM 54% IN TO 22% IN , THE COMMISSION , BY REGULATION NO 3542/OF DECEMBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ) IMPOSED AN ANTI-DUMPING DUTY EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE PRICE PER TONNE NET , FREE-AT-COMMUNITY FRONTIER , BEFORE DUTY , WAS LESS THAN ECU , VALID FOR A PERIOD OF FOUR MONTHS FROM JANUARY .   THAT PROVISIONAL ANTI-DUMPING DUTY WAS EXTENDED FOR A PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS BEGINNING ON MAY BY COUNCIL REGULATION NO 991/OF APRIL ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ). ON JUNE , THE COMMISSION , SINCE IT CONSIDERED THAT THE NECESSARY CONDITIONS WERE FULFILLED , SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL TO THE COUNCIL FOR THE IMPOSITION OF A DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING DUTY ON THE IMPORTS OF MAGNESITE CONCERNED ( COM() FINAL ). THE COUNCIL DECLINED , HOWEVER , TO ADOPT THAT PROPOSAL .  THE COMMISSION THEN BROKE OFF ITS INQUIRIES UNTIL MID-JUNE , THE DATE ON WHICH IT RECEIVED NEW PRIMA FACIE EVIDENCE OF DUMPING AND RENEWED INJURY CAUSED BY THE IMPORTS FROM CHINA OF DEAD-BURNED NATURAL MAGNESITE . ON THE BASIS OF THAT INFORMATION , THE COMMISSION DECIDED TO CONTINUE THE ANTI-DUMPING PROCEDURE IN REGARD TO THOSE IMPORTS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL C , P . ), BUT THIS TIME ON THE BASIS OF COUNCIL REGULATION NO 2176/OF JULY ON PROTECTION AGAINST DUMPED OR SUBSIDIZED IMPORTS FROM COUNTRIES NOT MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ), WHICH HAS REPLACED COUNCIL REGULATION NO 3017/.   FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY WHICH IT CONDUCTED DURING THE SUMMER OF , THE COMMISSION , AFTER MAKING A COMPARISON OF THE FIGURES IN ITS POSSESSION FOR THE YEARS TO , CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE EVIDENCE BEFORE IT CLEARLY SHOWED THAT IMPORTS OF DEAD-BURNED NATURAL MAGNESITE ORIGINATING IN THE PEOPLE ' S REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND IN NORTH KOREA WERE NO LONGER CAUSING TO COMMUNITY PRODUCTION SERIOUS INJURY OF SUCH A DEGREE AS TO JUSTIFY THE IMPOSITION OF A DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING DUTY . IT THEREFORE SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL TO THE COUNCIL FOR THE TERMINATION OF THE ANTI-DUMPING PROCEEDING CONCERNING THOSE IMPORTS .  THE COUNCIL ACCEPTED THAT PROPOSAL AND , ON MARCH , ON THE BASIS OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 2176/, ADOPTED THE ABOVEMENTIONED DECISION TERMINATING THE ANTI-DUMPING PROCEEDING WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES .  ARTICLE OF THE TREATY PROVIDES THAT THE COURT OF JUSTICE MAY IN ANY CASES BEFORE IT PRESCRIBE ANY NECESSARY INTERIM MEASURES .  IN ORDER FOR INTERIM MEASURES OF THE KIND SOUGHT IN THIS CASE TO BE ADOPTED , ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE REQUIRES THAT THE APPLICATION STATE THE FACTUAL AND LEGAL GROUNDS ESTABLISHING A PRIMA FACIE CASE FOR THE INTERIM MEASURES APPLIED FOR AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO URGENCY .  THE COURT HAS CONSISTENTLY HELD THAT URGENCY WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE IN REGARD TO AN APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES MUST BE ASSESSED ON THE BASIS OF WHETHER IT IS NECESSARY TO ADOPT SUCH MEASURES IN ORDER TO AVOID SERIOUS AND IRREPARABLE DAMAGE TO THE PARTY SEEKING THE ADOPTION OF THOSE MEASURES .  IN THAT REGARD , THE APPLICANT CLAIMS THAT BY REASON OF THE INITIATION OF PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COURT , THERE WAS A DANGER THAT RELEVANT DOCUMENTS WOULD BE CONCEALED OR ALTERED WHEREAS IT WAS ESSENTIAL THAT IT SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THEM IF IT WAS TO BE IN A POSITION TO REPLY TO THE DEFENDANTS '  ARGUMENTS AND PROVE THAT ITS ALLEGATIONS ARE WELL-FOUNDED .  FOR THEIR PART , THE DEFENDANTS , IN THE WRITTEN OBSERVATIONS WHICH THEY SUBMITTED IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES , CONSIDER THAT THE APPLICANT HAS PUT FORWARD NO ARGUMENT DEMONSTRATING THE EXISTENCE OF A RISK OF IRREPARABLE DAMAGE SINCE IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE DEFENDANT INSTITUTIONS MIGHT CONCEAL OR FALSIFY DOCUMENTS .  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MUST BE PROVED AND WHICH DO NOT EXIST IN THIS CASE , AN APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES IS NOT IN PRINCIPLE AN APPROPRIATE PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING THE PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS OF THE KIND APPLIED FOR IN THIS CASE . SUCH A MEASURE IS SIMILAR TO A MEASURE OF INQUIRY OF THE KIND WHICH THE COURT MAY ORDER UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STATUTE OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PROCEDURE DEALING WITH THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CASE . IT SHOULD ALSO BE MENTIONED THAT DURING THE HEARING , THE COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS CONFIRMED THE UNDERTAKING APPEARING IN THEIR WRITTEN OBSERVATIONS TO THE EFFECT THAT THEY WOULD MAKE AVAILABLE TO THE COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE PROCEDURES ANY DOCUMENT PRODUCTION OF WHICH THE COURT CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN ORDER TO BE ADEQUATELY INFORMED ON THIS CASE .  THAT PRINCIPLE IS REINFORCED BY THE FACT THAT THE RISK OF CONCEALMENT OR ALTERATION ALLEGED BY THE APPLICANT IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY THE NEED TO PRODUCE DOCUMENTS BEFORE THE COURT APPEARS TO BE WHOLLY IRRELEVANT , SINCE THE APPLICANT , WHICH IS REPRESENTED IN THE COUNCIL AND WHICH NORMALLY RECEIVES ALL DOCUMENTS CONNECTED WITH THAT INSTITUTION , DID NOT CONSIDER IT NECESSARY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE POSSIBILITY AVAILABLE TO IT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COUNCIL OF OBTAINING THE MINUTES OF THAT INSTITUTION IF IT SO WISHED . THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS ARE FURTHER REINFORCED BY THE FACT THAT THE GREEK UNDERTAKINGS WHICH SUBMITTED THE COMPLAINT GIVING RISE TO THE ANTI-DUMPING PROCEDURE AT ISSUE ALSO DID NOT CONSIDER IT NECESSARY TO ADDRESS A FORMAL WRITTEN REQUEST TO THE COMMISSION UNDER ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) OF COUNCIL REGULATION NO 2176/INDICATING THE INFORMATION REQUIRED .  IT APPEARS FROM THE DOCUMENTS IN THE CASE THAT THE ONLY ARGUMENT PUT FORWARD TO JUSTIFY URGENCY IS THE OBVIOUS RISK OF MODIFICATION OR CONCEALMENT OF RELEVANT DOCUMENTS BY THE EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED IN THE DISPUTE . IN THAT REGARD , THE COURT MADE IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR AT THE HEARING THAT IT WAS NOT PREPARED TO PERMIT AN ACCUSATION OF THAT NATURE , CASTING DOUBT ON THE GOOD FAITH AND IMPARTIALITY OF THE EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS , TO BE MADE WITHOUT ANY PROOF BEING ADVANCED IN SUPPORT OF IT . IN THE LIGHT OF THE COURT ' S POSITION ON THAT POINT , THE APPLICANT INFORMED IT THAT IT WITHDREW FROM ITS APPLICATION ANY STATEMENT CONTAINING AN ACCUSATION OF THAT SORT . IT MUST THEREFORE BE FOUND THAT THAT WITHDRAWAL REMOVES THE ONLY ARGUMENT ADVANCED BY THE APPLICANT ON THE QUESTION OF URGENCY .  THE OBSERVATIONS SET OUT ABOVE SHOW CLEARLY THAT THE APPLICANT HAS NOT SUCCEEDED IN PROVING URGENCY AS REQUIRED BY ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE AND IT THUS DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE FACTUAL AND LEGAL GROUNDS ADVANCED BY IT ESTABLISH A PRIMA FACIE CASE FOR THE INTERIM MEASURES APPLIED FOR .
