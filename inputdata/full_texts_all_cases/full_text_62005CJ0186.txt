Free movement of goods – Quantitative restrictions (Arts EC and EC) (see para. 26, operative part)
Re: 
Failure of a Member State to fulfil obligations – Infringement of Articles EC and EC – National legislation relating

Operative part
The Court: 
 
Declares that, by prohibiting the importation of alcoholic beverages by private individuals acting by their designated independent
                     intermediaries or professional transporters, the Kingdom of Sweden has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article EC
                     and that prohibition cannot be regarded as being justified under Article EC;
                  
 
Orders the Kingdom of Sweden to pay the costs.
