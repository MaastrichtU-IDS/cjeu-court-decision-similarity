Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR COMPENSATION FOR THE DAMAGE SUFFERED BY THE APPLICANT AS A RESULT OF THE COMMISSION ' S FAILURE TO REINSTATE HIM IN A POST IN HIS CATEGORY ON COMPLETION OF LEAVE ON PERSONAL GROUNDS , 
Grounds
THE APPLICANT COMPLAINS OF THE COMMISSION ' S DELAY IN REINSTATING HIM IN A POST IN HIS CATEGORY AND GRADE AT THE END OF LEAVE ON PERSONAL GROUNDS WHICH EXPIRED ON MAY AND SEEKS COMPENSATION FOR THE DAMAGE WHICH HE CLAIMS TO HAVE SUFFERED AS A RESULT .   DESPITE ITS AMBIGUOUS TERMS , THE APPLICATION MAY BE REGARDED AS SEEKING , FIRST , THE PARTIAL ANNULMENT OF THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION OF SEPTEMBER , REINSTATING THE APPLICANT IN A POST IN HIS CATEGORY AND GRADE WITH EFFECT FROM AUGUST AND , SECONDLY , THE AWARD OF DAMAGES UNDER VARIOUS HEADS .  APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT  ADMISSIBILITY   THE DEFENDANT CONTESTS THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION ON THE GROUND THAT THE CONTESTED DECISION IS NOT THE CAUSE OF THE ALLEGED DAMAGE , WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF EARLIER DECISIONS BY WHICH , IN DISREGARD OF THE OBLIGATION TO REINSTATE THE APPLICANT , VACANCIES WHICH AROSE AFTER HIS LEAVE ON PERSONAL GROUNDS HAD ENDED WERE FILLED .   WHILE COMPLAINING OF THE DELAY IN REINSTATING HIM , THE APPLICANT DOES NOT CONTEST THE LEGALITY OF THE DISPUTED DECISION IN SO FAR AS IT REINSTATES HIM , BUT ONLY IN SO FAR AS IT FAILS TO MAKE CERTAIN PROVISIONS , ESPECIALLY AS REGARDS THE DATE ON WHICH IT TAKES EFFECT AND THE BACKDATING OF SENIORITY IN GRADE AND STEP , WHICH WOULD HAVE CANCELLED THE EFFECTS OF THAT DELAY .   HIS INTEREST IN SEEKING ANNULMENT IS THE OBLIGATION WHICH MIGHT AS A RESULT BE IMPOSED ON THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY TO MAKE THE REINSTATEMENT SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT AND MORE FAVOURABLE CONDITIONS .   THE APPLICATION IS ADMISSIBLE .  THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CASE   IT IS APPARENT FROM THE FILE THAT , IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE ACCOUNT OF THE FACTS GIVEN IN THE PRESENT JUDGMENT , WHEN HIS LEAVE ON PERSONAL GROUNDS ENDED ON MAY THE APPLICANT MADE HIMSELF AVAILABLE TO THE COMMISSION FOR THE PURPOSE OF BEING REINSTATED IN A POST CORRESPONDING TO HIS CATEGORY AND GRADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE ( ) ( D ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS .   HIS REINSTATEMENT WAS ONLY GIVEN EFFECT BY A DECISION OF SEPTEMBER WHICH , MOREOVER , PROVIDES THAT IT SHALL TAKE EFFECT ON AUGUST ( ARTICLE ) AND THAT THE APPLICANT SHALL BE CLASSIFIED IN GRADE A WITH SENIORITY AS FROM SEPTEMBER AND IN STEP OF THAT GRADE WITH SENIORITY AS FROM MAY .    THE REASON FOR THE TWO LASTMENTIONED DATES IS THE FACT THAT , WHEN LEAVE ON PERSONAL GROUNDS WAS GRANTED TO HIM THE APPLICANT HAD MONTHS '  SENIORITY IN GRADE A AND MONTHS '  IN STEP OF THAT GRADE AND THAT THESE TWO PERIODS WERE INCORPORATED IN THE DECISION BY REFERENCE TO THE DATE ON WHICH HIS REINSTATEMENT TOOK EFFECT , AUGUST .    THE APPLICANT CONTESTS THE SELECTION OF THESE DATES AND CLAIMS ESPECIALLY THAT THE BACKDATING OF SENIORITY SHOULD HAVE BEEN BASED NOT ON THE ACTUAL DATE OF HIS REINSTATEMENT BUT THE DATE ON WHICH , AS REQUIRED BY ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , HE WAS REQUIRED TO BE REINSTATED .   ARTICLE ( ) ( D ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS IN THE VERSION APPLICABLE AT THE DATE ( JUNE ) ON WHICH THE APPLICANT ' S LEAVE ON PERSONAL GROUNDS ENDED PROVIDED THAT ' ON THE EXPIRY OF HIS LEAVE AN OFFICIAL MUST BE REINSTATED IN THE FIRST POST CORRESPONDING TO HIS GRADE WHICH FALLS VACANT IN HIS CATEGORY OR SERVICE . IF HE DECLINES THE POST OFFERED TO HIM , HE SHALL RETAIN HIS RIGHT TO REINSTATEMENT WHEN THE NEXT VACANCY . . . OCCURS ' .   BY REGULATION NO 1473/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE , WHICH CAME INTO FORCE ON JULY , THIS PROVISION WAS SUPPLEMENTED BY THE INCLUSION OF THE WORDS ' PROVIDED THAT HE SATISFIES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THAT POST ' .   THIS ADDITION IS NOT , HOWEVER , SUCH AS TO ALTER THE ASSESSMENT OF THE DEFENDANT ' S CONDUCT SINCE ALL IT DOES IS TO CONFIRM A DISCRETION WHICH , IN THE INTERESTS OF THE SERVICE , THE ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY HAS IN ANY CASE TO EXERCISE .   DURING THE ORAL PROCEDURE THE DEFENDANT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT VARIOUS POSTS CAPABLE OF BEING FILLED BY THE APPLICANT FELL VACANT SHORTLY AFTER THE EXPIRY OF THE LEAVE ON PERSONAL GROUNDS .   IN CONSEQUENCE , BY FAILING TO REINSTATE THE APPLICANT UNTIL MORE THAN TWO YEARS HAD ELAPSED , THE DEFENDANT IS IN BREACH OF ARTICLE ( ) ( D ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   BY BRINGING TO AN END , ALBEIT BELATEDLY , A SITUATION WHICH WAS CONTRARY TO THE LAW , THE DEFENDANT WAS UNDER A DUTY TO EXPUNGE , IN SO FAR AS POSSIBLE , THE CONSEQUENCES OF ITS ILLEGAL CONDUCT .   ALTHOUGH THE BASIC RULE LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS THAT A POST SHALL BE FILLED ONLY IF IT IS VACANT PREVENTS THE DECISION OF REINSTATEMENT FROM HAVING RETROACTIVE EFFECT , THE SITUATION COULD BE RESTORED TO LEGALITY , AT LEAST IN PART , BY ANTEDATING SENIORITY IN GRADE AND STEP AND MONTHS PRIOR , NOT TO THE DATE WHEN THE APPLICANT WAS REINSTATED BUT TO THE DATE WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN REINSTATED .   IT IS CLEAR FROM THE LIST OF VACANCIES PRODUCED BY THE APPLICANT THAT , ALTHOUGH MANY POSTS IN GRADE A 6/A HAVE BEEN FILLED SINCE JULY THESE POSTS WERE OF A VERY DIFFERENT KIND , SO THAT IT CANNOT BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT EACH OF THEM CORRESPONDED TO THE APPLICANT ' S ABILITIES .   IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES , IN VIEW BOTH OF THE DISCRETION VESTED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY AND OF THE RIGHT GRANTED TO AN OFFICIAL TO DECLINE THE FIRST OFFER OF REINSTATEMENT , IT SEEMS APPROPRIATE TO ACCEPT THAT IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF EVENTS THE APPLICANT SHOULD HAVE BEEN REINSTATED BY AUGUST .    THE DEFENDANT CONTENDS THAT THE ALLEGED DELAY IS IN PART DUE TO THE WRONGFUL OMISSION OF THE APPLICANT IN FAILING TO DRAW THE AUTHORITY ' S ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT HE WAS NOT BEING REINSTATED WITHIN THE NORMAL TIME .   IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO EXAMINE WHETHER THIS POSSIBILITY IS SUCH AS TO AFFECT THE ASSESSMENT OF THE CLAIM FOR DAMAGES BUT , IN THE CONTEXT OF AN APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT , THERE IS NO NEED TO TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE NORMAL DATE ON WHICH THE DEFENDANT WAS REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE DEFENDANT , IN FIXING , BY THE CONTESTED DECISION , THE DATE OF CLASSIFICATION ACCORDING TO SENIORITY IN GRADE AND STEP AT RESPECTIVELY SEPTEMBER AND MAY , WAS IN BREACH OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND OF THE RULE REQUIRING IT TO REMEDY SO FAR AS POSSIBLE THE CONSEQUENCES OF A BELATED APPLICATION OF THAT PROVISION .   THE DECISION MUST , TO THAT EXTENT , BE ANNULLED AND , FOR THE PURPOSE OF GIVING EFFECT TO THIS JUDGMENT , IT WILL BE FOR THE DEFENDANT TO DETERMINE THE APPLICANT ' S SENIORITY IN GRADE AND STEP AND TO CALCULATE HIS PENSION AS IF THE IRREGULARITY WHICH HAS BEEN FOUND HAD NOT OCCURRED .   THE COURT ACCORDINGLY EXPECTS THIS SENIORITY IN GRADE AND STEP TO BE FIXED AT , RESPECTIVELY , AND MONTHS FROM AUGUST .   THE CLAIM FOR DAMAGES   THE APPLICANT FURTHER SEEKS AN ORDER FOR THE PAYMENT TO HIM BY THE DEFENDANT , BY WAY OF COMPENSATION FOR THE DAMAGE WHICH HE CLAIMS TO HAVE SUFFERED AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE ALLEGED DELAY , OF VARIOUS SUMS UNDER THE FOLLOWING HEADINGS .  . LOSS OF SALARY FROM JULY TO AUGUST : BF . DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SALARY TO WHICH THE APPLICANT WOULD HAVE BEEN ENTITLED AS AN OFFICIAL OF THE COMMUNITY AND THE SALARY WHICH HE RECEIVED AS A FRENCH OFFICIAL FROM SEPTEMBER TO JULY : BF . LOSS OF CHANCES OF PROMOTION : BF . EXPENSES INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE DELAY IN REINSTATEMENT : BF IN ADDITION , THE APPLICANT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO OBTAIN COMPENSATION FOR ANY DAMAGE WHICH MAY BE CAUSED HIM OWING TO THE FACT THAT , BECAUSE HE WAS FORCED TO GIVE UP HIS OFFICE IN THE FRENCH ADMINISTRATION WITHOUT HAVING ARRANGED IN ADVANCE FOR HIS SECONDMENT OR RESIGNATION IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE OFFER OF REINSTATEMENT IN A COMMISSION POST , HE WAS DISMISSED BY THE SAID ADMINISTRATION ; THE LEGALITY OF THAT DISMISSAL IS , HOWEVER , THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE FRENCH ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS .  ADMISSIBILITY   ACCORDING TO THE DEFENDANT , THE CLAIM FOR DAMAGES IS INADMISSIBLE BECAUSE THE DECISION OF REINSTATEMENT IS NOT ILLEGAL AND , IN CONSEQUENCE , CANNOT CONSTITUTE A MEASURE CAPABLE OF ENGENDERING A CLAIM FOR COMPENSATION .   IT HAS ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT THE ILLEGALITY ATTACHING TO THE DECISION OF REINSTATEMENT CONSISTS BOTH IN IN THE DELAY IN TAKING THE DECISION AND IN THE FAILURE TO COMPENSATE FOR THAT DELAY .   THIS ILLEGALITY IS SUCH AS TO CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE APPLICANT , SO THAT THE SUBMISSION OF INADMISSIBILITY MUST BE DISMISSED .   THE DEFENDANT FURTHER CLAIMS THAT TWO OF THE VARIOUS HEADS OF DAMAGE ARE INADMISSIBLE , SPECIFICALLY THAT RELATING TO EXPENSES INCURRED BF AND THAT RELATING TO THE RESERVATION ARISING FROM THE APPLICANT ' S DISMISSAL BY THE FRENCH MINISTER OF FINANCE , ON THE GROUND THAT , CONTRARY TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , NO MENTION WAS MADE OF THOSE CLAIMS IN THE COMPLAINT ADDRESSED TO THE DEFENDANT ON DECEMBER .    UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AN APPEAL TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE SHALL LIE ONLY IF THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY HAS PREVIOUSLY HAD A COMPLAINT SUBMITTED TO IT AND THE COMPLAINT HAS BEEN REJECTED BY A DECISION .   THE OBJECT OF THAT PROVISION IS TO ENABLE AND ENCOURAGE AN AMICABLE SETTLEMENT OF DIFFERENCE WHICH HAS ARISEN BETWEEN OFFICIALS OR SERVANTS AND THE ADMINISTRATION ; IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THIS REQUIREMENT IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION BE IN A POSITION TO KNOW THE COMPLAINTS OR REQUESTS OF THE PERSON CONCERNED .   ON THE OTHER HAND , IT IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF THAT PROVISION TO BIND STRICTLY AND ABSOLUTELY THE CONTENTIOUS STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS , IF ANY , PROVIDED THAT THE CLAIMS SUBMITTED AT THAT STAGE CHANGE NEITHER THE CAUSE NOR THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF THE COMPLAINT .   THIS IS PARTICULARLY SO WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION , BY REMAINING SILENT AND HAVING RECOURSE TO THE PROCEDURE OF IMPLIED REJECTION , HAS REFUSED ALL CONSIDERATION OR DISCUSSION OF THE COMPLAINT .   MOREOVER , IN HIS COMPLAINT , THE APPLICANT , AFTER SETTING OUT HIS GROUNDS FOR COMPLAINT , CLAIMED THAT HIS BELATED REINSTATEMENT WAS CAUSING HIM CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE ' THE MAIN CONSTITUENTS '  OF WHICH HE WENT ON TO ENUMERATE .   IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES , THE ADDITIONAL FACTORS WHICH ARE ALLEGED TO STEM FROM THE CONDUCT FOR WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION IS CRITICIZED AND TO BE DIRECTED TO THE QUESTION OF COMPENSATION FOR THE DAMAGE WHICH THE APPLICANT CLAIMS TO HAVE SUFFERED ON THAT ACCOUNT MAY BE SUBMITTED FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COURT .  THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CASE   THE MEASURES WHICH THE DEFENDANT WILL HAVE TO TAKE IN ORDER TO GIVE EFFECT TO THIS JUDGMENT , IN SO FAR AS IT PARTIALLY ANNULS THE DECISION OF SEPTEMBER , WILL ONLY IN PART COMPENSATE FOR THE DAMAGE SUFFERED BY THE APPLICANT .   IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO CONSIDER THE VARIOUS CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION .   ALTHOUGH , IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY SERVICES RENDERED , THE APPLICANT CANNOT CLAIM PAYMENT OF ARREARS OF SALARY , HE IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE COMPENSATION FOR THE ACTUAL DAMAGE HE HAS SUFFERED THROUGH THE LOSS OF THIS SALARY AS A RESULT OF THE UNLAWFUL CONDUCT OF THE DEFENDANT .   IN PRINCIPLE , THE COMPENSATION PAYABLE ON THAT ACCOUNT SHOULD BE EQUAL TO THE NET EMOLUMENTS TO WHICH HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENTITLED , SUBJECT HOWEVER TO DEDUCTION OF THE NET EARNED INCOME RECEIVED FOR THE SAME PERIOD WHILE ENGAGED IN OTHER EMPLOYMENT .   AT THE SAME TIME , CONSIDERATION MUST BE GIVEN TO THE QUESTION WHETHER , AS THE DEFENDANT MAINTAINS , THE APPLICANT IS NOT , ON ACCOUNT OF HIS CONDUCT , PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DAMAGE SUFFERED .   THE PARTIES DISAGREE ON THE FACTS CONCERNING THE PERSONAL APPROACHES WHICH THE APPLICANT MADE WITH A VIEW TO HIS REINSTATEMENT AFTER IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT THIS WAS TAKING TIME .   IT IS CLEAR FROM THE FILE THAT , AT THE END OF HIS LEAVE , ON MAY , THE APPLICANT NOTIFIED HIS WISH TO BE REINSTATED ; THAT , ON JUNE , THE ADMINISTRATION INFORMED HIM THAT HE WOULD BE NOTIFIED OF ' THE FIRST VACANCY WHICH WOULD ENABLE YOU TO BE REINSTATED ' ; AND THAT , NINE MONTHS LATER , IN APRIL , HE REPLIED WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME TO A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM .   NEVERTHELESS , IT SEEMS THAT DURING THIS LATTER PERIOD OR SHORTLY AFTERWARDS HE TOOK STEPS WITH A VIEW TO BEING RE-ENGAGED AS AN OFFICIAL IN THE FRENCH MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND THAT HE WAS IN FACT RE-ENGAGED SINCE HE WAS REMUNERATED AS SUCH FROM SEPTEMBER .    IT IS NOT EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE APPLICANT WHO , WITHOUT DOUBT , HAD TO TAKE A NUMBER OF OFFICIAL STEPS IN ORDER TO SECURE HIS RE-EMPLOYMENT IN THE FRENCH ADMINISTRATION , IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN EMPLOYED BEFORE HE ENTERED THE SERVICE OF THE COMMUNITIES IN , DID NOT TAKE SIMILAR STEPS , TRACES OF WHICH WOULD SURELY BE BOUND TO BE IN EVIDENCE , IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE HIS REINSTATEMENT .   THE ABSENCE DURING THE WHOLE OF THAT PERIOD OF ANY OFFICIAL REQUEST OR PROTEST INDICATES , AT THE VERY LEAST , A LACK OF ORDINARY VIGILANCE LIKELY TO HELP TO PROLONG THE DELAY OF WHICH HE COMPLAINS .   THIS FACT MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN ASSESSING THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE DEFENDANT MUST MAKE GOOD THE DAMAGE .   IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND IN VIEW OF THE REDRESS PROVIDED BY THE FINDING OF ANNULMENT , JUSTICE WILL BE DONE BY ORDERING THE COMMUNITY TO PAY TO THE APPLICANT DAMAGES EQUAL TO THE LOSS OF NET SALARY SUFFERED FROM AUGUST TO AUGUST , TOGETHER WITH LEGAL INTEREST , AND BY DISMISSING THE REMAINDER OF THE CLAIM .   THE FIGURE , NAMELY BF , SUBMITTED BY THE APPLICANT AS REPRESENTING LOSS OF SALARY FROM JULY TO AUGUST , HAS NOT BEEN CONTESTED BY THE DEFENDANT .   IT MUST , HOWEVER , BE REDUCED BY THE EQUIVALENT OF A MONTH AND A HALF ' S SALARY SINCE THE NORMAL DATE FOR REINSTATEMENT HAS BEEN FIXED ABOVE AT AUGUST .    THE COMMISSION MUST THEREFORE BE ORDERED TO PAY TO THE APPLICANT THE SUM OF BF MINUS = TOGETHER WITH LEGAL INTEREST AT % FROM DECEMBER , THE DATE OF THE COMPLAINT LODGED BY THE APPLICANT .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY SHALL BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS IF THEY HAVE BEEN ASKED FOR IN THE SUCCESSFUL PARTY ' S PLEADING .   THE DEFENDANT HAS NOT SUCCEEDED IN ITS DEFENCE .   IT MUST THEREFORE BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ( FIRST CHAMBER )   HEREBY :   . ANNULS THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION OF SEPTEMBER IN SO FAR AS IT LAYS DOWN THE DATES FROM WHICH THE APPLICANT ' S SENIORITY IN GRADE AND STEP IS TO BE RECKONED ;  . ORDERS THE COMMISSION TO PAY TO THE APPLICANT THE SUM OF BF TOGETHER WITH INTEREST AT % FROM DECEMBER ;  . ORDERS THE DEFENDANT TO BEAR THE COSTS .
