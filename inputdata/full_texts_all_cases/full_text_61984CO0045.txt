Subject of the case
APPLICATION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY FOR THE SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF ARTICLE B OF COMMISSION DECISION NO 234/84/ECSC OF JANUARY ON THE EXTENSION OF THE SYSTEM OF MONITORING AND PRODUCTION QUOTAS FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS OF UNDERTAKINGS IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY , 
Grounds
ON FEBRUARY THE APPLICANT BROUGHT AN ACTION IN WHICH IT REQUESTED THE COURT TO DECLARE VOID ARTICLE B OF COMMISSION DECISION NO 234/84/ECSC OF JANUARY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , , L ) ON THE EXTENSION OF THE SYSTEM OF MONITORING AND PRODUCTION QUOTAS FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS OF UNDERTAKINGS IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY .   AT THE SAME TIME THE APPLICANT MADE AN APPLICATION FOR THE SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF THAT ARTICLE OF THE DECISION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY .   IN SUPPORT OF ITS APPLICATION THE APPLICANT ARGUES THAT ARTICLE B OF THE DECISION COMPLETES THE IMPLEMENTATION BY THE COMMISSION OF THE POLICY OF FREEZING TRADITIONAL PATTERNS OF TRADE BETWEEN MEMBER STATES , ADOPTED BY THE COUNCIL ON DECEMBER .    ARTICLE B OF DECISION NO 234/PROVIDES THAT A MEMBER STATE MAY SUBMIT A COMPLAINT TO THE COMMISSION IF IT ESTABLISHES , WITH REGARD TO CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF STEEL PRODUCTS , THAT DELIVERIES OF PRODUCTS IN ONE OF THOSE CATEGORIES HAVE BEEN ALTERED DURING A QUARTER TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT COMPARED WITH TRADITIONAL DELIVERIES . AFTER EXAMINING WHETHER THE COMPLAINT IS JUSTIFIED , IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURES LAID DOWN IN THE DECISION , THE COMMISSION MAY REQUEST THE UNDERTAKINGS IN QUESTION TO GIVE A COMMITMENT IN WRITING THAT , DURING THE FOLLOWING QUARTER , THEY WILL CORRECT THE IMBALANCE IN THEIR TRADITIONAL DELIVERIES . IF AN UNDERTAKINGS DOES NOT GIVE SUCH A COMMITMENT , OR IF THE COMMITMENT IS NOT HONOURED , THE COMMISSION MAY , PURSUANT TO THAT PROVISION , REDUCE THE PART OF THE UNDERTAKING ' S QUOTA WHICH MAY BE DELIVERED IN THE COMMON MARKET FOR THE FOLLOWING QUARTER BY A QUANTITY NOT EXCEEDING THAT WHICH CAUSED THE IMBALANCE IN TRADITIONAL DELIVERIES .   ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF THE TREATY ESTABLISHING THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY , ACTIONS BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT DO NOT HAVE SUSPENSORY     EFFECT . THE COURT MAY , HOWEVER , IF IT CONSIDERS THAT CIRCUMSTANCES SO REQUIRE , ORDER THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE CONTESTED DECISION BE SUSPENDED . IT MAY ALSO PRESCRIBE ANY OTHER NECESSARY INTERIM MEASURES .   ACCORDING TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE COURT ' S RULES OF PROCEDURE , THE COURT MAY SUSPEND THE OPERATION OF A MEASURE OR GRANT OTHER INTERIM MEASURES ONLY WHERE THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO URGENCY AND FACTUAL AND LEGAL GROUNDS ESTABLISHING A PRIMA FACIE CASE FOR SUCH MEASURES .   ARTICLE B WAS ADOPTED ON THE BASIS , IN PARTICULAR , OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY . THAT ARTICLE PERMITS THE COMMISSION , IN THE EVENT OF A REDUCTION IN DEMAND AMOUNTING TO A MANIFEST CRISIS , TO ESTABLISH PRODUCTION QUOTAS . THOSE QUOTAS MUST BE DETERMINED ON AN EQUITABLE BASIS , TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE PRINCIPLES SET OUT IN ARTICLES , AND OF THE ECSC TREATY , WHICH IN THE LAST-MENTIONED ARTICLE DECLARES QUANTITATIVE RESTRICTIONS ON THE MOVEMENT OF STEEL PRODUCTS TO BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE COMMON MARKET FOR COAL AND STEEL .   SINCE THE PROCEDURE PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE B WILL BE USED AGAINST UNDERTAKINGS WHICH HAVE ALTERED THEIR DELIVERIES TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT COMPARED WITH TRADITIONAL DELIVERIES , IT CANNOT AT FIRST SIGHT BE EXCLUDED THAT ARTICLE B MAY BE DIRECTED TOWARDS OBJECTIVES OTHER THAN THOSE PERMITTED BY ARTICLE OF THE TREATY , INASMUCH AS IT CONDUCES TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF QUANTITATIVE RESTRICTIONS ON TRADE BETWEEN MEMBER STATES IN SOME STEEL PRODUCTS .   SIMPLY BY READING THE DECISION IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR A PRODUCER OR DEALER TO IDENTIFY THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH HE COULD CONTINUE TO EXPORT TO OTHER MEMBER STATES . FOR EXAMPLE , THE TERM ' ' TRADITIONAL DELIVERIES ' '  IS NOT DEFINED IN THE DECISION ; NOR DOES IT EXPLAIN WHAT IS MEANT BY ' ' ALTERATION OF DELIVERIES TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT ' ' .   THE DECISION CONTAINS NO LIMIT OR CONDITION ON THE USE OF THE POWER TO REDUCE QUOTAS IF A SIGNIFICANT ALTERATION IN TRADITIONAL DELIVERIES IS ESTABLISHED .     IN PARTICULAR , AN UNDERTAKING WHICH OBSERVES THE RULES ON PRICES , QUOTAS , COMPETITION AND STATE AID MAY FEAR SANCTIONS MERELY BECAUSE IT HAS INCREASED ITS DELIVERIES TO OTHER MEMBER STATES .   BECAUSE OF THE INFLUENCE WHICH IT IS LIKELY TO HAVE ON THE IMMEDIATE ACTIONS OF UNDERTAKINGS , THE SYSTEM SO ESTABLISHED IS SUCH THAT THE REQUIREMENT OF URGENCY WOULD NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN MET .   HOWEVER , DURING THE INTERLOCUTORY PROCEEDINGS THE COMMISSION HAS MADE A NUMBER OF STATEMENTS WITH REGARD TO THE WAY IN WHICH IT INTENDS TO APPLY THE PROVISION IN ISSUE . THE COURT HAS TAKEN NOTE OF THOSE STATEMENTS .   THE COMMISSION HAS UNDERTAKEN TO APPLY ARTICLE B ACCORDING TO THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS :    ( A ) FIRST , ARTICLE B WILL NOT BE APPLIED SIMPLY BECAUSE AN ALTERATION IN TRADITIONAL DELIVERIES HAS BEEN OBSERVED ; IT WILL ONLY BE APPLIED WHERE THE CHANGE IN TRADITIONAL DELIVERIES MAY BE ASCRIBED TO THE ACTION OF UNDERTAKINGS ENGAGING IN PRACTICES WHICH ARE CONTRARY TO COMMUNITY LAW .   ( B)SECONDLY , THE MERE FACT THAT THE UNDERTAKING CONCERNED IS IN RECEIPT OF AID AUTHORIZED BY THE COMMISSION MAY NOT GIVE RISE TO A QUOTA REDUCTION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE B .    ( C)THIRDLY , IF THE COMMISSION ' S INQUIRY REVEALS INFRINGEMENTS OF OTHER PROVISIONS OF COMMUNITY LAW SUCH AS THOSE ON PRICES , QUOTAS , COMPETITION OR STATE AID , IT WILL FIRST OF ALL APPLY THE SANCTIONS PROVIDED FOR THOSE INFRINGEMENTS .   IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES , PENDING A FULL EXAMINATION OF THE COMPATIBILITY OF ARTICLE B WITH THE TREATY , IT MAY BE HELD THAT THOSE ASSURANCES REMOVE THE THREAT WITH WHICH THE UNDERTAKINGS WERE CONFRONTED AND WHICH COULD HAVE JUSTIFIED THE URGENT MEASURES REQUESTED BY THE APPLICANT .
