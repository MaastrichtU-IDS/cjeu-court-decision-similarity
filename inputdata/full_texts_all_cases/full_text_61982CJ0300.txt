IN CASE 300/REFERENCE TO THE COURT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE FINANZGERICHT ( FINANCE COURT ) DUSSELDORF , FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN       GESAMTHOCHSCHULE ( POLYTECHNIC/UNIVERSITY ) ESSEN  AND  HAUPTZOLLAMT ( PRINCIPAL CUSTOMS OFFICE ) DUSSELDORF  
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1798/OF THE COUNCIL OF JULY ON THE IMPORTATION FREE OF COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF DUTIES OF EDUCATIONAL , SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL MATERIALS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), AS AMENDED BY REGULATION NO 1027/OF MAY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), 
Grounds
BY ORDER OF OCTOBER WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON DECEMBER , THE FINANZGERICHT ( FINANCE COURT ) DUSSELDORF REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY A     QUESTION ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1798/OF THE COUNCIL OF JULY ON THE IMPORTATION FREE OF COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF DUTIES OF EDUCATIONAL , SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL MATERIALS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), ADOPTED IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE FLORENCE AGREEMENT ( UNITED NATIONS TREATY SERIES VOLUME , , NO , PP . ET SEQ .).   THE QUESTION AROSE IN THE COURSE OF AN ACTION BROUGHT BEFORE THE NATIONAL COURT BY THE GESAMTHOCHSCHULE ( POLYTECHNIC/UNIVERSITY ) ESSEN FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION OF THE HAUPTZOLLAMT ( PRINCIPAL CUSTOMS OFFICE ) DUSSELDORF REFUSING EXEMPTION FROM CUSTOMS DUTIES ON THE IMPORTATION OF PLASTIC BLOCKS KNOWN AS ' ' PHANTOM MATERIAL A-' ' , ORIGINATING IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND INTENDED BY THE GESAMTHOCHSCHULE TO SIMULATE HUMAN MUSCLE TISSUE TO ENABLE THE EFFECT OF RADIATION ON THE HUMAN ORGANISM TO BE MEASURED , ON THE GROUND THAT THE MATERIAL WAS NOT A SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENT OR APPARATUS WITHIN THE MEANING OF REGULATION NO 1798/.    THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION CLAIMED BEFORE THE NATIONAL COURT THAT THE MATERIAL IN QUESTION OUGHT TO BE REGARDED AS A ' ' SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENT OR APPARATUS ' '  WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED REGULATION , SINCE IT CONSTITUTED NOT THE OBJECT BUT THE INSTRUMENT OF RESEARCH , BEING USED FOR THE NEUTRON DOSIMETERS EMPLOYED IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE , AND ALSO BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY BY USING THE MATERIAL THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO ASSESS AND COMPARE , AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL , THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM RESEARCH .   ON THE REJECTION OF THAT ARGUMENT BY THE HAUPTZOLLAMT , THE FINANZGERICHT DUSSELDORF REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING THE FOLLOWING QUESTION :    ' ' IN REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1798/OF THE COUNCIL OF JULY , IS THE TERM ' SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENT '  TO BE INTERPRETED BROADLY SO AS TO INCLUDE SCIENTIFIC AIDS AND WORKING MATERIALS SUCH AS PHANTOM MATERIAL A-, A SUBSTANCE MADE UP OF PLASTIC BLOCKS AND INTENDED FOR RADIOLOGICAL RESEARCH?  ' '   IT APPEARS FROM THE PAPERS BEFORE THE COURT THAT THE MATERIAL IN QUESTION HAS A SPECIAL COMPOSITION RESULTING FROM DISCOVERIES OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND IS MANUFACTURED BY ONLY ONE UNDERTAKING WHICH IS SITUATED OUTSIDE THE     COMMUNITY . ON BEING EXPOSED TO RADIATION IT PRODUCES , OWING TO ITS COMPOSITION , REACTIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF HUMAN TISSUE . FOR THAT REASON IT IS USED IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PROJECTS UNDERTAKEN IN THE INTERESTS OF HUMAN HEALTH AS A MEANS OF MEASURING THE EFFECT OF NEUTRON RAYS ON HUMAN TISSUE .   THE USE OF THE MATERIAL IN QUESTION ALSO SERVES TO FACILITATE THE ASSESSMENT AND COMPARISON , AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL , OF THE RESULTS OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PROJECTS IN THE FIELD OF NEUTRON DOSIMETRY .   CONSEQUENTLY , THE QUESTION REFERRED TO THE COURT ASKS WHETHER THE TERM ' ' SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENT ' '  IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1798/MUST BE INTERPRETED AS INCLUDING A MATERIAL SUCH AS THE ONE KNOWN AS PHANTOM MATERIAL A-, MADE UP OF PLASTIC BLOCKS AND INTENDED FOR RADIOLOGICAL RESEARCH , INASMUCH AS THAT MATERIAL FULFILS AN ESSENTIAL FUNCTION AS AN INDISPENSABLE MEANS OF OBTAINING CERTAIN RESULTS FROM LONG-TERM SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH .   IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT NEITHER THE FLORENCE AGREEMENT NOR REGULATION NO 1798/CONTAINS A DEFINITION OF THE TERM ' ' SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENT ' '  FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE SAID REGULATION . A DEFINITION MUST THEREFORE BE SOUGHT IN THE PURPOSE OF THAT PROVISION , CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF ALL THE PROVISIONS OF , AND THE PREAMBLE TO , REGULATION NO 1798/.    SINCE , ACCORDING TO THE FIRST RECITAL IN THE PREAMBLE TO THAT REGULATION , IT IS NECESSARY TO ALLOW ' ' BY ALL POSSIBLE MEANS ' '  THE ADMISSION FREE OF CUSTOMS DUTIES OF EDUCATIONAL , SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL MATERIALS , THE TERM ' ' SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENT ' '  IN ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1798/CANNOT BE GIVEN A NARROW INTERPRETATION .   THAT CONCLUSION IS CONFIRMED BY THE PREAMBLE TO THE FLORENCE AGREEMENT , WHICH IS BASED ON THE IDEA ' ' THAT THE FREE EXCHANGE OF IDEAS AND KNOWLEDGE AND , IN GENERAL , THE WIDEST POSSIBLE DISSEMINATION OF THE DIVERSE FORMS OF SELF-EXPRESSION USED BY CIVILIZATIONS ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT BOTH FOR INTELLECTUAL PROGRESS AND INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING ' '  AND ' ' THAT THIS INTERCHANGE IS     ACCOMPLISHED PRIMARILY BY MEANS OF BOOKS , PUBLICATIONS AND EDUCATIONAL , SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL MATERIALS ' ' .   IN THAT CONTEXT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND SUPPORT FOR A NARROW INTERPRETATION IN THE FACT THAT ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1798/REFERS GENERALLY TO SCIENTIFIC ' ' MATERIALS ' '  LISTED IN ANNEX II , WHEREAS ARTICLE ( ) RELATES TO ' ' SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS AND APPARATUS ' '  NOT INCLUDED IN ARTICLE .    ARTICLE IN FACT CONTAINS TWO ADDITIONAL CRITERIA WHICH PERMIT A SUFFICIENTLY PRECISE DEFINITION TO BE GIVEN OF A SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENT WHICH MAY BE ADMITTED FREE OF CUSTOMS DUTY , NAMELY THAT IT SHOULD BE INTENDED EXCLUSIVELY FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH OR EDUCATION AND THAT IT IS NOT BEING MANUFACTURED IN THE COMMUNITY . IN VIEW OF THOSE TWO CONDITIONS FOR THE GRANT OF EXEMPTION , IT IS INAPPROPRIATE TO INTERPRET THE CONCEPT IN QUESTION IN A MANNER CONTRARY TO THE PURPOSE OF REGULATION NO 1798/AS SET OUT ABOVE .   MOREOVER , IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1798/WAS AMENDED BY REGULATION NO 1027/( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) AND THAT ARTICLE ( ) AS AMENDED GIVES A GENERAL DEFINITION OF THE TERM ' ' SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENT OR APPARATUS ' ' , FOLLOWING IN PART THE EXAMPLE SET BY THE COURT IN ITS JUDGMENT OF FEBRUARY IN CASE 72/, UNIVERSITEITSKLINIEK UTRECHT V INSPECTEUR DER INVOERRECHTEN EN ACCIJNZEN , ( ) ECR .    ARTICLE ( ) AS AMENDED IS NOT APPLICABLE IN THIS CASE , SINCE THE FACTS UPON WHICH THE DISPUTE IN THE MAIN ACTION ARE BASED OCCURRED BEFORE THE AMENDMENT OF REGULATION NO 1798/; EVEN SO IT CANNOT JUSTIFY SUCH A NARROW INTERPRETATION .   NOR DOES THE ABOVE-MENTIONED JUDGMENT OF THE COURT PREVENT THE TERM ' ' SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENT ' '  FROM BEING INTERPRETED WIDELY ENOUGH TO INCLUDE MATERIALS MANUFACTURED ON THE BASIS OF SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES AND USED NOT AS     AN OBJECT BUT AS A MEANS OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH . THAT IS IN ANY EVENT TRUE IN THE CASE OF MATERIALS SUCH AS THOSE IN THIS CASE WHICH CANNOT EASILY BE REPLACED AND WHICH ARE THEREFORE USED FOR LONG-TERM SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH .   THESE FINDINGS ARE SUFFICIENT TO GIVE A REPLY TO THE NATIONAL COURT , WITHOUT ITS BEING NECESSARY TO PROVIDE HERE AN EXHAUSTIVE DEFINITION OF A SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENT .   FINALLY , IN RELATION TO THE COMMISSION ' S OPINION THAT CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES CANNOT FALL WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF A SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENT , IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS CASE IS NOT CONCERNED WITH ANY CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE BUT WITH A MATERIAL USED AS A TOOL IN A PARTICULAR SCIENTIFIC CONTEXT . FOR THE SAME REASON IT IS ALSO UNNECESSARY TO CONSIDER THE COMMISSION ' S ARGUMENT THAT CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES ARE COVERED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF REGULATION NO 1798/, NAMELY IN ARTICLE OF COUNCIL REGULATION NO 918/OF MARCH ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ).   THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION SUBMITTED TO THE COURT BY THE FINANZGERICHT DUSSELDORF SHOULD THEREFORE BE THAT THE TERM ' ' SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENT ' '  IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1798/MUST BE INTERPRETED AS INCLUDING A MATERIAL SUCH AS THE ONE KNOWN AS PHANTOM MATERIAL A-, MADE UP OF PLASTIC BLOCKS AND INTENDED FOR RADIOLOGICAL RESEARCH , INASMUCH AS THE MATERIAL FULFILS AN ESSENTIAL FUNCTION AS AN INDISPENSABLE MEANS OF OBTAINING CERTAIN RESULTS FROM LONG-TERM SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , WHICH HAS SUBMITTED OBSERVATIONS TO THE COURT , ARE NOT RECOVERABLE . AS THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE , IN SO FAR AS THE PARTIES TO THE MAIN ACTION ARE CONCERNED , IN THE NATURE OF A STEP IN THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE NATIONAL COURT , COSTS ARE A MATTER FOR THAT COURT .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ( SECOND CHAMBER )   IN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION SUBMITTED TO IT BY THE FINANZGERICHT DUSSELDORF BY ORDER OF OCTOBER HEREBY RULES :   THE TERM ' ' SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENT ' '  IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1798/MUST BE INTERPRETED AS INCLUDING A MATERIAL SUCH AS THE ONE KNOWN AS PHANTOM MATERIAL A-, MADE UP OF PLASTIC BLOCKS AND INTENDED FOR RADIOLOGICAL RESEARCH , INASMUCH AS THE MATERIAL FULFILS AN ESSENTIAL FUNCTION AS AN INDISPENSABLE MEANS OF OBTAINING CERTAIN RESULTS FROM LONG-TERM SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH .
