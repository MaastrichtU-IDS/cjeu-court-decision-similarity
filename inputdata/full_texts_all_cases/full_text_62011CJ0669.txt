                  rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1493/on the common organisation of the market in wine, with regard to market
                  mechanisms (OJ L 194, p. 45), of Article of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/of December on the
                  protection of the European Communities financial interests (OJ L 312, p. 1), and of the provisions of Commission Regulation

                  operations referred to in Articles 35, and of Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/and held by intervention agencies (OJ
                  L 43, p. 6) and of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/of July laying down common detailed rules for the application
                  of the system of securities for agricultural products (OJ L 205, p. 5) – Individual sales by invitation to tender for
                  the export of vinous alcohol held by intervention agencies for the purpose of an end use as motor fuel – Time-limit for export

Operative part
1.
	The failure of an operator to comply with the time-limit for export imposed in respect of quantities of alcohol obtained in
                     an invitation to tender procedure organised by the European Commission, as governed by Commission Regulation (EC) No 360/of February opening individual sales by invitation to tender for the export of vinous alcohol held by intervention
                     agencies, constitutes an ‘irregularity’ within the meaning of Article of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/of
                     December on the protection of the European Communities financial interests.
                  
2.
	The loss in whole or in part of a performance guarantee, such as that provided for in Article 5(5) of Regulation No 360/95,
                     or of a security to ensure export within the time allowed, such as that provided for in Article 91(12) of Commission Regulation
                     (EC) No 1623/of July laying down detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1493/on the common organisation
                     of the market in wine, with regard to market mechanisms, is covered by the concept of ‘administrative penalty’ within the
                     meaning of Article of Regulation No 2988/95.
                  
3.
	In circumstances such as those of the main proceedings, Article 5(5) of Regulation No 360/constitutes the necessary legal
                     basis for the imposition of a penalty consisting of the loss in whole or in part of a performance guarantee.
                  
4.
	In circumstances such as those of the main proceedings, Article 2(2) of Regulation No 2988/must be interpreted as meaning
                     that, in order to penalise a failure to comply with the time-limit allowed for the export to Brazil of quantities of alcohol
                     obtained by invitation to tender under the provisions of Regulation No 360/95, the national authorities must apply the penalty
                     laid down in Article 5(5) of the latter regulation, and not that laid down in Article 91(12) of Regulation No 1623/2000.
