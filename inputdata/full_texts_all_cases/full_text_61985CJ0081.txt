Summary
. AN APPLICANT MAY STILL , EVEN AFTER THE EXPIRY OF THE PERIOD FOR CHALLENGING A GENERAL DECISION , PLEAD THE ILLEGALITY OF THAT DECISION IN PROCEEDINGS INSTITUTED AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL DECISION BASED UPON THE GENERAL DECISION .  . IF A REQUEST IS TO SET IN MOTION THE PROCEDURE FOR AN ACTION FOR FAILURE TO ACT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY , IT MUST BE SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR AND PRECISE TO ENABLE THE COMMISSION TO ASCERTAIN IN SPECIFIC TERMS THE CONTENT OF THE DECISION WHICH IT IS BEING ASKED TO ADOPT . THAT IS NOT THE CASE WHERE A LETTER , WHILST STATING THE PURPOSE OF THE REQUEST , CONTEMPLATES THE POSSIBILITY OF FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH THE COMMISSION AND HENCE DOES NOT CLEARLY INDICATE THAT THE COMMISSION IS BEING CALLED UPON TO ADOPT A FORMAL DECISION WITHIN A MANDATORY PERIOD .  . SINCE A REQUEST FOR AN INCREASE IN ANNUAL REFERENCE PRODUCTION IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS AS FROM A GIVEN QUARTER AMOUNTS TO AN APPLICATION FOR ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION QUOTAS , THE COMMISSION DECISION WHICH MUST BE REGARDED AS AN IMPLIED REJECTION OF THAT REQUEST AND WHICH IS THEREFORE CAPABLE OF ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE UNDERTAKING CONCERNED IS THE FIRST DECISION WHICH , AFTER THE SUBMISSION OF THE REQUEST AND WITHOUT TAKING IT INTO ACCOUNT , FIXES THE PRODUCTION QUOTAS FOR THE UNDERTAKING . SINCE THE LATTER DID NOT CHALLENGE THAT DECISION WITHIN THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED FOR THE INITIATION OF PROCEEDINGS , AN APPLICATION DIRECTED AGAINST A SUBSEQUENT DECISION OF THE COMMISSION WHICH , BY FIXING THE PRODUCTION QUOTAS FOR ANOTHER QUARTER WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE REFERENCE PRODUCTION SOUGHT , MERELY REAFFIRMS THE FIRST DECISION ' S REFUSAL OF THE REQUEST MUST BE DISMISSED BY THE COURT OF ITS OWN MOTION , INASMUCH AS IT IS NOT DIRECTED AGAINST THE DECISION ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE UNDERTAKING .  . IT FOLLOWS FROM ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY THAT AN ACTION FOR COMPENSATION FOR THE DAMAGE ARISING FROM AN INDIVIDUAL DECISION MAY BE BROUGHT BY AN UNDERTAKING ONLY AFTER THE DECISION WHICH ALLEGEDLY CAUSED THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN DECLARED VOID AND AFTER IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT THE COMMISSION DOES NOT INTEND TO TAKE THE STEPS NEEDED TO REDRESS THE ILLEGALITY FOUND TO EXIST .

Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION OF FEBRUARY FIXING USINOR ' S STEEL PRODUCTION AND DELIVERY QUOTAS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF ( CASE 81/) AND THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION OF MARCH ( CASE 119/) ARE VOID , INASMUCH AS THEY REFUSE TO INCREASE USINOR ' S REFERENCE PRODUCTION FOR CATEGORY IC AND ID PRODUCTS , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATIONS LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON AND APRIL , THE UNION SIDERURGIQUE DU NORD ET DE L ' EST DE LA FRANCE , A LIMITED COMPANY WHOSE REGISTERED OFFICE IS SITUATED AT PUTEAUX ( HAUTS-DE-SEINE , FRANCE ), BROUGHT TWO ACTIONS UNDER THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY SEEKING ( IN CASE 81/) A DECLARATION THAT THE COMMISSION ' S INDIVIDUAL DECISION OF FEBRUARY IS VOID AND ( IN CASE 119/) A DECLARATION THAT THE COMMISSION ' S INDIVIDUAL DECISION OF MARCH AND , IN SO FAR AS IS NECESSARY , THE LETTER OF MARCH ARE VOID , IN SO FAR AS THOSE DECISIONS REFUSE TO INCREASE USINOR ' S REFERENCE PRODUCTION IN RESPECT OF CATEGORY IC AND ID PRODUCTS . IN ADDITION , THE APPLICANT SEEKS A DECLARATION FROM THE COURT THAT COMMISSION DECISIONS NO 2177/83/ECSC OF JULY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , , P . ) AND NO 234/84/ECSC OF JANUARY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , , P . ), ON THE EXTENSION OF THE SYSTEM OF MONITORING AND PRODUCTION QUOTAS FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS OF UNDERTAKINGS IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY , ARE UNLAWFUL INASMUCH AS THEY HAVE WITHDRAWN THE POSSIBILITY OF INCREASING REFERENCE PRODUCTION . FINALLY , THE APPLICANT SEEKS COMPENSATION FOR THE DAMAGE WHICH IT CLAIMS TO HAVE SUFFERED .  BY ORDER OF THE SECOND CHAMBER OF THE COURT OF FEBRUARY , THE TWO CASES WERE JOINED FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE ORAL PROCEDURE AND THE JUDGMENT .  BEFORE THOSE APPLICATIONS ARE CONSIDERED , IT IS NECESSARY TO RECALL THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THE CONTESTED DECISIONS WERE ADOPTED .  COMMISSION DECISION NO 1831/81/ECSC OF JUNE ESTABLISHING FOR UNDERTAKINGS IN THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY A MONITORING SYSTEM AND A NEW SYSTEM OF PRODUCTION QUOTAS IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , , P . ) PROVIDED THAT THE COMMISSION WAS TO CARRY OUT , ON CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF PRODUCTS , AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE REFERENCE PRODUCTION IF THE UNDERTAKING BROUGHT NEW PRODUCTION PLANT INTO OPERATION UNDER AN INVESTMENT PROGRAMME ON WHICH THE COMMISSION HAD NOT DELIVERED A NEGATIVE OPINION . THAT POSSIBILITY OF ADJUSTING THE REFERENCE PRODUCTION WAS RESTRICTED BY COMMISSION DECISION NO 1696/82/ECSC OF JUNE ON THE EXTENSION OF THE SYSTEM OF MONITORING AND PRODUCTION QUOTAS FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS OF UNDERTAKINGS IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , , P . ) AND IS NO LONGER PROVIDED FOR IN DECISIONS NO 2177/AND NO 234/. COMMISSION DECISION NO 470/85/ECSC OF FEBRUARY AMENDING DECISION NO 234/84/ECSC ON THE EXTENSION OF THE SYSTEM OF MONITORING AND PRODUCTION QUOTAS FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS OF UNDERTAKINGS IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , , P . ) AGAIN ALLOWS THE COMMISSION TO GRANT ADDITIONAL QUOTAS IN RESPECT OF CATEGORY ID ON CERTAIN CONDITIONS .  ON MAY , IN ACCORDANCE WITH COMMISSION DECISION NO 3302/81/ECSC OF NOVEMBER ON THE INFORMATION TO BE FURNISHED BY STEEL UNDERTAKINGS ABOUT THEIR INVESTMENTS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , , P . ), THE APPLICANT GAVE THE COMMISSION ADVANCE NOTICE OF A PLAN TO INVEST IN A NEW GALVANIZING PLANT . ON FEBRUARY THE COMMISSION DELIVERED A FAVOURABLE OPINION , TAKING THE VIEW THAT THE PLAN WAS IN CONFORMITY WITH THE GENERAL OBJECTIVES OF THE COMMUNITY .  ON THE BASIS OF THAT FAVOURABLE OPINION , THE APPLICANT REQUESTED THE COMMISSION , BY LETTER OF APRIL , TO INCREASE ITS REFERENCE PRODUCTION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF IN RESPECT OF CATEGORY IC AND ID PRODUCTS .  ON JUNE THE COMMISSION REPLIED THAT USINOR ' S REQUEST WOULD BE EXAMINED BY THE DIRECTORATE FOR STEEL .  BY LETTER OF JULY THE APPLICANT INFORMED THE COMMISSION THAT ITS NEW GALVANIZING PLANT HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO SERVICE .  ON DECEMBER THE COMMISSION NOTIFIED USINOR OF ITS PRODUCTION AND DELIVERY QUOTAS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF , WHICH WERE CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF ITS EXISTING ANNUAL REFERENCE PRODUCTION AND REFERENCE QUANTITIES . ON FEBRUARY IT SENT THE APPLICANT A FURTHER NOTIFICATION ADJUSTING THE PRODUCTION QUOTAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NEW ABATEMENT RATES ESTABLISHED BY DECISION NO 313/85/ECSC OF FEBRUARY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , , P . ).  AFTER THE APPLICANT HAD INSTITUTED PROCEEDINGS IN CASE 81/, THE COMMISSION SUGGESTED , IN A LETTER OF MARCH AND IN A FURTHER LETTER OF MARCH , THAT USINOR SHOULD REQUEST AN ADJUSTMENT PURSUANT TO DECISION NO 470/, WHICH HAD RECENTLY BEEN ADOPTED .  THE COMMISSION OBJECTS THAT THE TWO APPLICATIONS ARE INADMISSIBLE ON THE GROUND THAT THEY WERE SUBMITTED OUT OF TIME .  THE COMMISSION CONTENDS IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT SINCE THE POSSIBILITY OF GRANTING ADDITIONAL REFERENCE QUANTITIES WAS WITHDRAWN BY DECISION NO 2177/AND WAS NO LONGER PROVIDED FOR IN DECISION NO 234/, WHICH WAS IN FORCE AT THE TIME WHEN THE REQUEST WAS MADE , IT WAS LEGALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR IT TO ACCEDE TO THAT REQUEST . IF THE APPLICANT CONSIDERED THAT ITS RIGHTS WERE INFRINGED BY THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE POSSIBILITY OF GRANTING ADDITIONAL REFERENCE QUANTITIES , IT SHOULD HAVE CONTESTED THOSE GENERAL DECISIONS .  WITH REGARD TO THE FIRST OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY , IT SHOULD BE POINTED OUT THAT THE APPLICANT MAY STILL , EVEN AFTER THE EXPIRY OF THE PERIOD FOR CHALLENGING A GENERAL DECISION , PLEAD THE ILLEGALITY OF THAT DECISION IN PROCEEDINGS INSTITUTED AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL DECISION BASED UPON THE GENERAL DECISION ( SEE THE JUDGMENTS OF JUNE IN CASE 15/COMPAGNIE DES HAUTS FOURNEAUX DE CHASSE ( ) ECR ; OF JUNE IN CASE 9/MERONI ( ) ECR ; OF JUNE IN CASE 10/MERONI ( ) ECR ; AND OF JULY IN JOINED CASES AND 33/SNUPAT ( ) ECR ). IN THIS CASE , IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE DECISION REFUSING TO INCREASE THE REFERENCE PRODUCTION IS NECESSARILY BASED UPON THE FACT THAT DECISION NO 234/, WHICH WAS IN FORCE AT THE TIME WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL DECISION WAS ADOPTED , MAKES NO PROVISION FOR SUCH AN ADJUSTMENT , AND THAT THERE IS A DIRECT LEGAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT INDIVIDUAL DECISION AND THE GENERAL DECISION ( SEE THE COURT ' S JUDGMENT OF MARCH IN CASE 21/MACCHIORLATI DALMAS E FIGLI ( ) ECR ). MOREOVER , IT MUST BE POINTED OUT THAT THE APPLICANT ' S PRINCIPAL CLAIM IS NOT THAT DECISION NO 234/SHOULD BE DECLARED UNLAWFUL BUT THAT IT SHOULD BE INTERPRETED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO ALLOW THE INCREASES SOUGHT BY THE APPLICANT TO BE GRANTED ON A TEMPORARY BASIS IN ORDER TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE RIGHTS ACQUIRED BY IT IN THE PAST .  THE COMMISSION ALSO CONTENDS THAT THE FAILURE TO ADOPT AN EXPRESS DECISION IN REPLY TO THE APPLICANT ' S LETTER OF APRIL MUST BE REGARDED AS AN IMPLIED REJECTION PROVIDING A BASIS FOR AN ACTION FOR FAILURE TO ACT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY . IT CLAIMS THAT THE APPLICANT TOOK NO ACTION WITHIN THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED BY THAT PROVISION .  WITH REGARD TO THE SECOND OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY , IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND THAT , IF A REQUEST IS TO SET IN MOTION THE PROCEDURE FOR AN ACTION FOR FAILURE TO ACT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY , IT MUST BE SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR AND PRECISE TO ENABLE THE COMMISSION TO ASCERTAIN IN SPECIFIC TERMS THE CONTENT OF THE DECISION WHICH IT IS BEING ASKED TO ADOPT ( SEE THE JUDGMENTS OF APRIL IN JOINED CASES TO 26/MERONI ( ) ECR AND OF JULY IN CASE 75/HAKE ( ) ECR ). MOREOVER , IT MUST BE CLEAR FROM THE REQUEST THAT ITS PURPOSE IS TO COMPEL THE COMMISSION TO STATE ITS POSITION .  IN THIS CASE , IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT , ALTHOUGH THE LETTER OF APRIL REVEALS SUFFICIENTLY CLEARLY THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE APPLICANT ' S REQUEST WAS TO SECURE THE GRANT OF AN ADDITIONAL REFERENCE PRODUCTION TOTALLING TONNES PER ANNUM AS FROM THE SECOND QUARTER OF , IT DOES NOT CLEARLY INDICATE THAT THE COMMISSION WAS BEING CALLED UPON TO ADOPT A FORMAL DECISION IN RESPONSE TO THAT REQUEST . ON THE CONTRARY , BY EXPRESSING ITS READINESS , AT THE END OF THE LETTER , TO PROVIDE ANY DETAILS WHICH THE COMMISSION MIGHT REQUIRE , THE APPLICANT ITSELF CONTEMPLATED THE POSSIBILITY OF FURTHER DISCUSSIONS AND THUS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE LETTER COULD NOT MARK THE COMMENCEMENT OF A MANDATORY PERIOD FOR THE ADOPTION OF A DECISON .  THE TWO OBJECTIONS OF INADMISSIBILITY RAISED BY THE COMMISSION MUST THEREFORE BE REJECTED .  HOWEVER , IT IS FOR THE COURT TO CONSIDER OF ITS OWN MOTION WHETHER THE CONTESTED DECISION OF FEBRUARY IS IN FACT THE DECISION IN WHICH THE COMMISSION REPLIED FOR THE FIRST TIME - IF ONLY BY IMPLICATION - TO THE APPLICANT ' S REQUEST .  IN THAT REGARD , IT IS NECESSARY FIRST OF ALL TO DETERMINE THE PURPOSE OF THE APPLICANT ' S REQUEST .  IN SEEKING AN INCREASE IN ITS ANNUAL REFERENCE PRODUCTION AS FROM THE SECOND QUARTER OF , THE APPLICANT WAS ENDEAVOURING TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION QUOTAS IN RESPECT OF CATEGORIES IC AND ID AS FROM THAT QUARTER .  CONSEQUENTLY , THE DECISION WHICH MUST BE REGARDED AS AN IMPLIED REJECTION OF THAT REQUEST AND WHICH IS THEREFORE CAPABLE OF ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE APPLICANT CAN ONLY BE THE FIRST DECISION ADOPTED AFTER THE SUBMISSION OF THE REQUEST , IN WHICH THE PRODUCTION QUOTAS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF WERE FIXED WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE REQUEST FOR THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE REFERENCE PRODUCTION AS FROM THE SECOND QUARTER OF . THE APPLICANT DID NOT CHALLENGE THAT DECISION WITHIN THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED FOR THE INITIATION OF PROCEEDINGS .  THE CONTESTED DECISION OF FEBRUARY FIXING THE PRODUCTION QUOTAS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF , IN SO FAR AS IT DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE REFERENCE PRODUCTION SOUGHT BY THE APPLICANT BY LETTER OF APRIL , MERELY REAFFIRMS THE DECISIONS PREVIOUSLY ADOPTED . THAT IS CLEAR , MOREOVER , FROM A COMPARISON WITH THE INDIVIDUAL DECISION OF DECEMBER ( ANNEXED TO THE APPLICATION ) FIXING THE PRODUCTION QUOTAS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF , WHICH ADOPTS THE REFERENCE PRODUCTION FOR WITHOUT TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE INCREASES SOUGHT BY THE APPLICANT AND WHICH , IN THAT RESPECT , IS IDENTICAL TO THE TWO PRECEDING DECISIONS FIXING THE PRODUCTION QUOTAS FOR THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF . THE CONTESTED DECISION OF FEBRUARY MERELY ADJUSTED THE PRODUCTION QUOTAS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NEW ABATEMENT RATES INTRODUCED BY DECISION NO 313/, WITHOUT AMENDING THE REFERENCE PRODUCTION IN ANY WAY .  ACCORDINGLY , THE APPLICATION IN CASE 81/MUST BE DISMISSED INASMUCH AS IT IS NOT DIRECTED AGAINST THE DECISION ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE APPLICANT .  AS REGARDS THE APPLICATION FOR DAMAGES , THIS MUST ALSO BE DECLARED INADMISSIBLE HAVING REGARD TO THE WORDING OF ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY , WHICH ALLOWS SUCH AN APPLICATION TO BE BROUGHT ONLY AFTER THE DECISION WHICH ALLEGEDLY CAUSED THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN DECLARED VOID AND AFTER IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT THE HIGH AUTHORITY DOES NOT INTEND TO TAKE THE STEPS NEEDED TO REDRESS THE ILLEGALITY FOUND TO EXIST .  WITH REGARD TO THE APPLICATION IN CASE 119/, IT SHOULD BE NOTED , AS THE COMMISSION HAS RIGHTLY POINTED OUT , THAT THE LETTER OF MARCH WHEREBY IT SUGGESTED THAT USINOR SHOULD SUBMIT A FURTHER REQUEST FOR THE ADJUSTMENT OF ITS REFERENCE PRODUCTION PURSUANT TO DECISION NO 470/, IS MERELY INTENDED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND IS NOT THEREFORE IN THE NATURE OF A DECISION CAPABLE OF BEING CHALLENGED BY LEGAL PROCEEDINGS .  ACCORDINGLY , THE APPLICATION IN CASE 119/MUST ALSO BE DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE .
