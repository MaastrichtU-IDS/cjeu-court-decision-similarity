Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling — Hoge Raad der Nederlanden — Interpretation of Articles EC and EC (now Articles
                  TFEU and TFEU) — National rules requiring payment of a registration tax on the first use of a vehicle on the national
                  road network — Liability to that tax of a person who has transferred residence from another Member State, is a national of
                  that Member State and uses, on a permanent basis, a vehicle registered there, and included in the transfer of residence, for
                  purposes of private and work-related use involving work-related travel to that other Member State. 
               
Operative part 
Article EC must be interpreted as not precluding legislation of a Member State that requires its residents who have moved
         from another Member State and have brought with them a vehicle registered in that latter Member State, on the first use of
         that vehicle on the national road network, to pay a tax normally due on the registration of a vehicle in the first Member
         State, when that vehicle is essentially used permanently in the territory of that first Member State, even if that use includes
         journeys by those residents to their place of work in the second Member State.
