Re: 
References for a preliminary ruling – Tribunal de première instance de Namur – Interpretation of the first paragraph of Article
                  6(1) TEU and of Article of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union – Whether national legislation permitting
                  the production, import, promotion and sale of manufactured smoking tobacco, recognised to be seriously harmful, is compatible
                  with the object of protecting human health – Whether the provisions of national law authorising the levying of excise duty
                  on tobacco products are valid in the light of the [EU] rules cited.
               
Operative part 
 
	The Court of Justice of the European Union is manifestly incompetent to reply to the questions referred by the Tribunal de
                     première instance de Namur (Belgium) by decisions of March 2010.
