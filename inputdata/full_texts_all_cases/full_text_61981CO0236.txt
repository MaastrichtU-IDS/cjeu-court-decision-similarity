Grounds
THE REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT PUT FORWARD BY THE APPLICANT IS ACCEPTED .

THAT PROVISION MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT , WITH APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS , IN PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT .   IN THIS CASE IT APPEARS EQUITABLE TO ENSURE CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT FOR THE DOCUMENTS AND PARTS OF DOCUMENTS FOR WHICH SUCH TREATMENT HAS BEEN CLAIMED BY THE APPLICANT AND ALREADY ACCEPTED BY THE DEFENDANT INSTITUTIONS .   AS REGARDS THE DOCUMENTS WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN THE SUBJECT OF AN EXAM-  INATION BY BOTH SIDES IT WILL BE FOR THE APPLICANT TO EXAMINE THEM WITH THE     DEFENDANT INSTITUTIONS AND TO REPORT TO THE COURT SO AS TO ENABLE IT TO ARRIVE AT A DECISION . IN THE EVENT OF CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT ' S NOT BEING ENSURED TO THE FULL EXTENT DESIRED BY THE APPLICANT THE LATTER MUST HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY IF IT DESIRES TO WITHDRAW ANY DOCUMENTS AND PARTS OF DOCUMENTS TO WHICH SUCH A REFUSAL RELATES .   IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ARRANGEMENTS SET OUT ABOVE ALL THE MATERIAL WHOSE CONFIDENTIAL NATURE HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY THE COURT WILL BE PLACED IN A SPECIAL FILE , WHICH WILL ONLY BE DISCLOSED TO THE PRINCIPAL PARTIES AND THE OFFICERS OF THE COURT . THE ONUS WILL BE UPON THE APPLICANT TO TAKE ALL NECESSARY STEPS TO ENABLE THE COURT REGISTRY TO ASSEMBLE SUCH A FILE .   THE COURT HOWEVER RESERVES ITS DECISION AS REGARDS THE USE WHICH IT MAY NEED TO MAKE OF DOCUMENTS OF A CONFIDENTIAL NATURE IF RESPECT FOR THE CONFIDENTIAL NATURE OF SUCH MATERIAL SHOULD CREATE A CONFLICT WITH THE DUTY IMPOSED UPON THE COURT BY ARTICLES AND OF ITS STATUTE TO STATE THE REASONS ON WHICH ITS JUDGMENTS ARE BASED AND TO GIVE SUCH JUDGMENT IN OPEN COURT , OR WITH THE DUTY IMPOSED ON THE ADVOCATE GENERAL BY THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY TO DELIVER AN OPINION IN PUBLIC . IN THE EVENT OF SUCH A SITUATION ' S ARISING THE COURT MUST REMAIN FREE TO EXCLUDE FROM THE FILE ANY DOCUMENTS OR PARTS OF DOCUMENTS WHICH WOULD MAKE IMPOSSIBLE A PUBLIC STATEMENT OF THE REASONS ON WHICH ITS JUDGMENT IS BASED , AND TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF SUCH EXCLUSION WHEN DECIDING THE CASE .
