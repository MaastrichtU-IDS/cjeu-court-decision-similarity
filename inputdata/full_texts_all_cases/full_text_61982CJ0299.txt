Subject of the case
APPLICATION TO OBTAIN A REGRADING OF THE APPLICANT PURSUANT TO THE GENERAL DECISION OF THE COMMISSION OF JULY ON THE REINSTATEMENT ON PROMOTION OF OFFICIALS SECONDED TO THE OFFICE OF A MEMBER OF THE COMMISSION , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON DECEMBER HORST W . STEINFORT , AN OFFICIAL OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR A DECLARATION THAT HE WAS ENTITLED TO BE PROMOTED TO GRADE A .  THE APPLICANT ENTERED THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE COMMISSION IN AS A PRINCIPAL ADMINISTRATOR IN GRADE A AND FROM TO PERFORMED THE DUTIES OF CHEF DE CABINET TO MR MARGULIES , A MEMBER OF THE EAEC COMMISSION . AT THE END OF THAT SECONDMENT , DURING WHICH HE OCCUPIED A GRADE A POST , HE WAS ASSIGNED TO THE EAEC DIRECTORATE-GENERAL FOR RESEARCH AND THEN IN PROMOTED TO GRADE A IN DIRECTORATE-GENERAL XIII OF THE COMMISSION , INFORMATION MARKET AND INNOVATION . BY LETTER DATED FEBRUARY HE REQUESTED THAT THE COMMISSION PROMOTE HIM TO GRADE A ON THE BASIS OF A DECISION TAKEN BY THE COMMISSION IN JULY .    SINCE THE APPLICATION IS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BASED ON THE SAID DECISION OF JULY IT IS APPROPRIATE TO REFER FIRST OF ALL TO ITS TERMS . THE DECISION , WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN PUBLISHED , APPEARS IN THE MINUTES OF THE SITTING OF THE COMMISSION ON JULY . UNDER THE HEADING ' ' REINSTATEMENT ON PROMOTION OF OFFICIALS SECONDED TO A MEMBER ' S OFFICE ' '  THE MINUTES READ AS FOLLOWS :       ' ' ON A PROPOSAL FROM THE PRESIDENT AND MR O ' KENNEDY THE COMMISSION ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING DECISION :   . ' A '  OFFICIALS PROMOTED TO ANOTHER CAREER BRACKET DURING A PERIOD OF SECONDMENT TO A MEMBER ' S OFFICE SHALL REJOIN THE DEPARTMENTS IN WHICH PROMOTION IS ACCORDED THEM ' '  (. . . REINTEGRERONT LEUR SERVICE OU LA PROMOTION LEUR EST ASSUREE . . .) ' '  WITHIN MONTHS IN THE CASE OF PROMOTION TO A , A OR A OR AT THE END OF THE COMMISSION ' S TERM OF OFFICE IN THE CASE OF PROMOTION TO A .   . IN THE CASE OF PROMOTIONS WITHIN THE SAME CAREER BRACKET AND PROMOTIONS TO A . . . ' '    IN THE APPLICANT ' S VIEW THE DECISION MEANS THAT OFFICIALS OF CATEGORY A WHO ARE SECONDED TO A MEMBER ' S OFFICE ARE ENTITLED TO PROMOTION WITHIN A PARTICULAR PERIOD AFTER THEIR REINSTATEMENT IN THEIR ORIGINAL DEPARTMENT AND THAT PERIOD IS THREE MONTHS IN THE CASE OF PROMOTION TO GRADE A . THAT INTERPRETATION OF THE DECISION IS CONFIRMED BY THE CLAUSE ' ' OU LA PROMOTION LEUR EST ASSUREE ' '  AND IN PARTICULAR BY THE WORD ' ' ASSUREE ' '  WHICH WOULD HAVE NO MEANING IF FORMER STAFF OF A MEMBER ' S OFFICE WERE NOT TO BE PROMOTED .   IN THE VIEW OF THE COMMISSION THE DECISION RELATES NOT TO THE RIGHT TO PROMOTION OF OFFICIALS WHO HAVE BEEN SECONDED TO A MEMBER ' S OFFICE BUT TO THE PERIOD WITHIN WHICH OFFICIALS PROMOTED WHILE ON SECONDMENT SHOULD BE REINSTATED . THAT SUCH IS ITS PURPORT , AS APPEARS INTER ALIA FROM THE WORDING OF THE DECISION AND FROM THE FACT THAT IT HAS NEVER BEEN PUBLISHED AS BEING OF A PURELY INTERNAL NATURE , IS DEMONSTRATED BY THE NOTE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION AND FROM MR O ' KENNEDY WHICH WAS THE BASIS OF THE DECISION .  THAT NOTE CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE :    ' ' SINCE PROMOTION TO GRADES A , A AND A ENTAILS THE OCCUPATION OF HIGHLY RESPONSIBLE POSTS WHICH IT IS ESSENTIAL TO FILL SPEEDILY FOR THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF THE DEPARTMENTS , IT SEEMS DESIRABLE TO SHORTEN THE PERIODS AGREED ON IN AND TO MAKE THEM MONTHS FOR ALL THE GRADES UNDER CONSIDERATION . ' '       THE INTERPRETATION GIVEN BY THE COMMISSION MUST BE FOLLOWED . THE ARGUMENT FAVOURED BY THE APPLICANT WOULD RENDER THE MAIN CLAUSE IN THE DECISION AT ISSUE ( ' ' OFFICIALS . . . SHALL REJOIN THE DEPARTMENTS . . . WITHIN MONTHS . . . ' ' ) MEANINGLESS . MOREOVER , SINCE THAT HYPOTHESIS WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF CONFERRING RETROACTIVELY PROMOTION TO HIGH GRADES ON ALL OFFICIALS WHO HAVE BEEN SECONDED TO A MEMBER ' S OFFICE IT WOULD DEPART FROM THE PROCEDURE UNDER THE STAFF REGULATIONS GOVERNING PROMOTION WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE DIFFICULTY OF FINDING SUFFICIENT POSTS CORRESPONDING TO SUCH GRADES .   THE OTHER COMPLAINTS MADE BY THE APPLICANT , SUCH AS DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT AND MISUSE OF POWERS BY THE COMMISSION , ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY PRECISE TO WARRANT CONSIDERATION .   THE APPLICATION MUST THEREFORE BE REJECTED .
