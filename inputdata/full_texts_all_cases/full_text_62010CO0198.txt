Reference for a preliminary ruling – Corte d’appello di Milano – Interpretation of Articles and of Directive 98/71/EC
                  of the European Parliament and of the Council of October on the legal protection of designs – National legislation
                  transposing the directive into national law by introducing copyright protection for designs – Right of a Member State to extend
                  the conditions for the grant of such protection.
               
Operative part 
Article of Directive 98/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of October on the legal protection
         of designs must be interpreted as precluding legislation of a Member State which excludes, either entirely or within the limits
         of prior use, from protection by the law of copyright of that Member State designs which entered the public domain before
         that legislation entered into force, with regard to all third parties who have previously manufactured or marketed in the
         national territory products based on those designs before that date.
