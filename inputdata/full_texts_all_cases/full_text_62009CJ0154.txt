Operative part
The Court: 
1.
	Declares that, by failing to transpose correctly into national law the provisions of European Union law governing the designation
                     of universal service provider(s) and, in any event, by failing to ensure that those provisions are applied in practice, the
                     Portuguese Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles 3(2) and 8(2) of  Directive 2002/22/EC of the European
                     Parliament and of the Council of March on universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic communications
                     networks and services (Universal Service Directive). 
                  
2.
	Orders the Portuguese Republic to pay the costs.
