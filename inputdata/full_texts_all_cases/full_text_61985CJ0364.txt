Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON NOVEMBER THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION, PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY, FOR A DECLARATION THAT, BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH DIRECTIVES 80/219, 80/AND 80/1102, AMENDING DIRECTIVE 64/ON ANIMAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AFFECTING INTRA-COMMUNITY TRADE IN BOVINE ANIMALS AND SWINE, THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY .  THE DIRECTIVES IN QUESTION ARE AS FOLLOWS :  COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 80/219/EEC OF JANUARY AMENDING DIRECTIVE 64/432/EEC AS REGARDS TUBERCULOSIS AND BRUCELLOSIS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL 1980, L*47, P.*);  J . 364/- -  COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 80/1098/EEC OF NOVEMBER AMENDING DIRECTIVE 64/432/EEC WITH REGARD TO SWINE VESICULAR DISEASE AND CLASSICAL SWINE FEVER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL 1980, L*325, P.*);  COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 80/1102/EEC OF NOVEMBER AMENDING DIRECTIVE 64/432/EEC WITH REGARD TO ENZOOTIC BOVINE LEUKOSIS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL 1980, L*325, P.*).  ARTICLE OF DIRECTIVE 80/PROVIDES THAT THE MEMBER STATES ARE TO BRING INTO FORCE THE NECESSARY LAWS, REGULATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS BY DECEMBER AT THE LATEST AND ARE TO INFORM THE COMMISSION THEREOF FORTHWITH . ARTICLE OF DIRECTIVE 80/AND ARTICLE OF DIRECTIVE 80/REQUIRE THE SAME STEPS TO BE TAKEN BY JULY AND JANUARY RESPECTIVELY .  SINCE IT HAD RECEIVED NO COMMUNICATION FROM THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT ABOUT THE MEASURES TO BE TAKEN TO TRANSPOSE THE DIRECTIVES IN QUESTION INTO NATIONAL LAW, THE COMMISSION SENT IT A LETTER ON DECEMBER GIVING IT FORMAL NOTICE AND ASKING IT TO SUBMIT OBSERVATIONS . AFTER ISSUING A REASONED OPINION ON NOVEMBER 1985, TO WHICH NO RESPONSE WAS FORTHCOMING, THE COMMISSION BROUGHT THIS ACTION .  REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING FOR THE BACKGROUND TO THE CASE AND THE SUBMISSIONS AND ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES, WHICH ARE MENTIONED OR DISCUSSED HEREINAFTER ONLY IN SO FAR AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE REASONING OF THE COURT .  THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT ADMITS IT HAS NOT FULFILLED ITS OBLIGATIONS BUT POINTS OUT THAT A BILL DESIGNED TO SECURE THE TRANSPOSITION INTO NATIONAL LAW OF THE DIRECTIVES IN QUESTION IS AT PRESENT BEFORE THE SENATE . AT THE HEARING IT INTIMATED THAT ONE OF THE SENATE' S ADVISORY COMMITTEES HAD ADOPTED AN OPINION IN FAVOUR OF THE BILL, J . 364/- -  THAT THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES HAD NOT YET EXAMINED THE BILL AND THAT IT TRUSTED THAT THE BILL WOULD BE ABLE TO BECOME LAW WITHIN TWO TO THREE MONTHS .  ACCORDING TO WELL-ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW OF THE COURT, A MEMBER STATE MAY NOT PLEAD PROVISIONS, PRACTICES OR CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING IN ITS INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OBLIGATIONS AND TIME-LIMITS RESULTING FROM COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES .  MOREOVER, AS THE COURT HAS STATED IN ITS JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER ( CASE 136/COMMISSION V ITALIAN REPUBLIC (( )) ECR ), THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE MEMBER STATES PARTICIPATE IN THE PREPARATORY WORK FOR DIRECTIVES AND MUST THEREFORE BE IN A POSITION TO PREPARE, WITHIN THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED, THE DRAFT LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS NECESSARY FOR THEIR IMPLEMENTATION .  IT MUST THEREFORE BE DECLARED THAT, BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 80/219/EEC OF JANUARY AND COUNCIL DIRECTIVES 80/1098/EEC AND 80/1102/EEC OF NOVEMBER 1980, THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY .
