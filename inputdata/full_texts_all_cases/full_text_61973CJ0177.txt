APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT OF THE IMPLIED REJECTION BY THE DEFENDANT OF THE APPLICANT'S COMPLAINT FOR THE PURPOSE OF ESTABLISHING HIS RIGHT, AT THE TIME OF HIS TERMINATION OF SERVICE, TO A RESETTLEMENT ALLOWANCE EQUAL TO TIMES HIS FINAL SALARY . 
Grounds
THE APPEAL IN CASE 177/FILED AT THE REGISTRY ON OCTOBER AND THE APPEAL IN CASE 5/FILED ON JANUARY SEEK THE ANNULMENT OF THE IMPLIED DECISION REJECTING THE COMPLAINT MADE BY THE APPLICANT THAT HIS RESETTLEMENT ALLOWANCE SHOULD BE EQUAL TO FOUR TIMES HIS LAST BASIC SALARY .  THE APPLICANT MAINTAINS THAT UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TRANSITIONAL AND FINAL PROVISIONS OF THE ECSC STAFF REGULATIONS WHICH CAME INTO FORCE ON JANUARY 1962, HE HAS RETAINED THE BENEFIT OF THE SYSTEM OF RESETTLEMENT ALLOWANCE ORIGINALLY PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF THE GENERAL REGULATIONS OF WHICH DETERMINED THE AMOUNT OF THIS ALLOWANCE .  HE CONTENDS THAT NEW PROVISIONS THUS APPLICABLE TO STAFF WHO TOOK UP EMPLOYMENT AFTER THE REGULATIONS CAME INTO FORCE AND CONTINUED BY THE CONSOLIDATED STAFF REGULATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, WHICH REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF THIS ALLOWANCE TO TWICE THE BASIC SALARY, DO NOT APPLY TO HIM .  ADMISSIBILITY  IN CASE 177/THE COMMISSION HAS RAISED A DEFENCE OF INADMISSIBILITY BASED ON THE PREMATURE NATURE OF THE APPEAL, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT AT THE TIME THE APPEAL WAS FILED THERE HAD AS YET BEEN NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED DECISION ON THE DEPARTMENTAL COMPLAINT .  THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS PROVIDES THAT AN APPEAL SHALL LIE ONLY IF THE COMPLAINT HAS BEEN REJECTED BY EXPRESS DECISION OR BY IMPLIED DECISION .  ARTICLE ( ) PROVIDES FOR A SINGLE DEROGATION FROM PARAGRAPH IN THE CASE OF AN APPEAL ACCOMPANIED BY AN APPLICATION FOR A STAY OF EXECUTION OF THE CONTESTED ACT .  SINCE THIS DEROGATION DOES NOT APPLY TO THE PRESENT CASE APPEAL 177/IS INADMISSIBLE .  IN AN INTERLOCUTORY APPLICATION THE COMMISSION RAISED WITH REGARD TO APPEAL 5/A DEFENCE OF INADMISSIBILITY BASED IN THE FIRST PLACE ON THE LACK OF INTEREST ON THE PART OF THE APPLICANT IN CLAIMING PAYMENT OF A RESETTLEMENT ALLOWANCE SINCE THE APPLICANT WAS NOT AS YET RESETTLED .  IN THE SECOND PLACE, THE LETTER FROM THE DIRECTOR OF PERSONNEL OF MAY 1973, WHICH WAS LIMITED TO SUPPLYING THE APPLICANT WITH SIMPLE ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION RELATING TO THE SUBSTANCE OF A PURELY HYPOTHETICAL DECISION, DID NOT CONSTITUTE AN ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING HIM .  UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF ANNEX VII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS THE RESETTLEMENT ALLOWANCE IS TO BE CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO THE DATE OF TERMINATION OF SERVICE .  IF THE OFFICIAL MAY CLAIM HIS RIGHTS ONLY AFTER HIS EFFECTIVE RESETTLEMENT, HE COULD BE UNCERTAIN AS TO HIS FINANCIAL POSITION .  ON APPLICATION TO TERMINATE HIS SERVICE AN OFFICIAL HAS IN CONSEQUENCE AN INTEREST IN REQUESTING A DEFINITE DECISION AS TO THE AMOUNT OF THE RESETTLEMENT ALLOWANCE .  ONLY THOSE ACTS CAPABLE OF DIRECTLY AFFECTING A PRECISE LEGAL POSITION CAN BE REGARDED AS ADVERSELY AFFECTING AN OFFICIAL .  BEFORE HIS APPLICATION TO LEAVE THE SERVICE WAS ACCEPTED, THE APPLICANT REQUESTED OVER THE TELEPHONE AN INTERPRETATION OF THE PROVISIONS IN QUESTION .  BY LETTER DATED MARCH, WHICH REFERS TO THIS TELEPHONE CONVERSATION, THE APPLICANT, WHILE MENTIONING HIS CLAIM TO A RESETTLEMENT ALLOWANCE EQUAL TO FOUR TIMES HIS BASIC SALARY, REQUESTED A 'MORE AUTHORITATIVE' INTERPRETATION OF THE SAID PROVISIONS .  THIS SHOWS CLEARLY THAT HE WANTED A DEFINITE DECISION ON WHICH PROCEEDINGS, BOTH ADMINISTRATIVE AND CONTENTIOUS, COULD BE BASED .  THE APPLICANT LEFT THE SERVICE ON MAY AND THE DIRECTOR OF PERSONNEL REPLIED ON MAY REJECTING HIS CLAIM .  THE DECISION OF THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF MAY WAS CONSEQUENTLY AIMED AT DETERMINING THE RIGHTS WHICH THE APPLICANT HAD IN A PARTICULAR LEGAL SITUATION .  IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE DECISION CONTAINED IN THE LETTER OF MAY REJECTING THE APPLICANT'S CLAIM OF MARCH CONSTITUTED AN ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING HIM WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  THE DEFENCE OF INADMISSIBILITY MADE IN APPEAL 5/MUST THEREFORE BE REJECTED .  SUBSTANCE  ARTICLE ( ) OF THE ECSC STAFF REGULATIONS, WHICH COMES UNDER TITLE VIII CONCERNED WITH TRANSITIONAL AND FINAL PROVISIONS, PROVIDES THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE RESETTLEMENT ALLOWANCE DUE TO ESTABLISHED OFFICIALS UNDER THE OLD ECSC STAFF REGULATIONS WHO TERMINATE THEIR SERVICE AFTER THE NEW REGULATIONS COME INTO FORCE SHALL NOT BE LESS THAN THE AMOUNT WHICH THE PERSONS CONCERNED WOULD HAVE RECEIVED UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF THE FORMER ECSC GENERAL REGULATIONS .  A TRANSITIONAL PROVISION ISSUED ON THE TRANSITION TO A LESS GENEROUS SYSTEM DOES NOT NORMALLY SEEK TO GIVE EMPLOYEES GREATER RIGHTS THAN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD UNDER THE SYSTEM WHICH IS REVOKED .  SUCH A PROVISION CANNOT THEREFORE BE INTERPRETED AS ALLOWING A COMBINATION OF THE MORE FAVOURABLE METHOD OF CALCULATION OF ONE SYSTEM WITH THE MORE FAVOURABLE SALARY SCALE OF ANOTHER .  ARTICLE ( ), IN PROVIDING EXPRESSLY THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE PAID TO AN OFFICIAL SHALL NOT BE LESS THAN THAT WHICH HE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED UNDER ARTICLE OF THE FORMER REGULATIONS, WAS INTENDED TO PREVENT AN OFFICIAL WHO TERMINATES HIS SERVICE AFTER THE NEW SYSTEM HAS COME INTO FORCE FROM FINDING HIMSELF FINANCIALLY IN A LESS FAVOURABLE POSITION THAN HE WOULD HAVE HAD IF HE HAD LEFT THE SERVICE BEFORE THE NEW SYSTEM CAME INTO FORCE .  HAVING REGARD TO THE NEW SALARY SCALES IN FORCE SINCE JANUARY 1962, WHEN THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE EQUAL TO TWO MONTHS' BASIC SALARY IS LESS THAN THE AMOUNT EQUAL TO FOUR MONTHS' BASIC SALARY AT THE SAME GRADE CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF THE OLD SALARY SCALES, THIS PROVISION ENABLES THE OFFICIAL CONCERNED TO ENJOY THE MORE FAVOURABLE TERMS .  AS SOON AS THE NEW SALARY SCALES DOUBLE THE SALARIES PRIOR TO 1962, THIS SAFEGUARD CLAUSE IS NO LONGER APPLICABLE .  THE APPEAL IN CASE 5/MUST THEREFORE BE REJECTED AS UNFOUNDED .  
Decision on costs
THE APPLICANT HAS FAILED IN HIS APPEAL .  UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY MUST BEAR THE COSTS .  NEVERTHELESS, UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, IN ACTIONS BY STAFF OF THE COMMUNITIES THE INSTITUTIONS SHALL BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS,  THE COURT ( SECOND CHAMBER )  HEREBY :  . DISMISSES APPEAL 177/AS INADMISSIBLE;  . DISMISSES APPEAL 5/AS UNFOUNDED;  . ORDERS EACH PARTY TO BEAR ITS OWN COSTS .
