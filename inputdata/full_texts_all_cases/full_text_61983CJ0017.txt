Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT OF THE COMMISSION ' S REFUSAL TO GRANT THE APPLICANT ADDITIONAL SENIORITY OF TWO STEPS , 
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON FEBRUARY , ANGEL ANGELIDIS , AN OFFICIAL OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , BROUGHT AN ACTION SEEKING THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION RELATING TO HIS STEP CLASSIFICATION , CONTAINED IN THE INSTRUMENTS OF MAY AND DECEMBER APPOINTING THE APPLICANT AS A PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL AND AS AN ESTABLISHED OFFICIAL IN GRADE A RESPECTIVELY , AND ASSIGNING HIM TO THE DIRECTORATE GENERAL FOR AGRICULTURE AS A PRINCIPAL ADMINISTRATOR .   THE DOCUMENTS BEFORE THE COURT INDICATE THAT THE APPLICANT WAS ENGAGED , IN THE FIRST PLACE , BY A CONTRACT OF JULY AS A MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF IN THE CAPACITY OF TRANSLATOR AT GRADE L/A , STEP . BY A CONTRACT OF AUGUST , HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO A POST OF ADMINISTRATOR IN THE DIRECTORATE GENERAL FOR AGRICULTURE , STILL AS A TEMPORARY EMPLOYEE , IN GRADE A , STEP , KEEPING THE SENIORITY ACQUIRED IN HIS PREVIOUS POST . HAVING BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN COMPETITION NO COM/A/, HE WAS APPOINTED , BY A DECISION OF MAY , AS A PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL IN THE CAPACITY OF PRINCIPAL ADMINISTRATOR IN GRADE A , STEP .    ON JUNE , MR ANGELIDIS SUBMITTED A COMPLAINT , REGISTERED ON JULY , SEEKING ADDITIONAL SENIORITY OF MONTHS AND THEREFORE CLASSIFICATION IN STEP OF GRADE A . NO REPLY WAS MADE TO THAT COMPLAINT . BY A DECISION     OF DECEMBER , THE APPLICANT WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE SAME CAPACITY AND AT THE SAME GRADE AND STEP .   THE SUBJECT OF THE DISPUTE IS THE APPLICANT ' S STEP CLASSIFICATION . MR ANGELIDIS CONSIDERS THAT IN THE LIGHT OF HIS EXPERIENCE BEFORE ENTERING THE SERVICE OF THE COMMUNITIES , HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED , AT THE TIME OF HIS APPOINTMENT AS AN OFFICIAL , IN STEP OF HIS GRADE , BY VIRTUE OF THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND ARTICLE OF THE COMMISSION DECISION OF JUNE ON THE CRITERIA APPLICABLE TO GRADE AND STEP CLASSIFICATION UPON RECRUITMENT .   THE APPLICANT CLAIMS THAT THE COURT SHOULD :    ( A ) ANNUL THE DECISIONS OF MAY AND DECEMBER IN SO FAR AS THEY CONCERN HIS CLASSIFICATION IN STEP ; AND   ( B)DECLARE THAT HE MUST BE ASSIGNED TO STEP OF GRADE A .     THE COMMISSION ' S PRINCIPAL ARGUMENT IS THAT ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , RELIED UPON BY THE APPLICANT , IS NOT RELEVANT . THAT ARTICLE APPLIES ONLY TO CASES OF RECRUITMENT . HOWEVER , MR ANGELIDIS WAS NOT RECRUITED AS A RESULT OF THE CONTESTED DECISIONS BECAUSE HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF BEFORE BEING APPOINTED AS AN OFFICIAL . HIS CASE MUST THEREFORE BE DEALT WITH BY ANALOGY WITH ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , WHICH DEALS WITH PROMOTIONS . HOWEVER , IN VIEW OF THE DISTANCE SEPARATING GRADE A , STEP , PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED BY THE APPLICANT , AND GRADE A , MR ANGELIDIS COULD ONLY OBTAIN THE FIRST STEP IN HIS NEW GRADE .   IN THE ALTERNATIVE , THE COMMISSION CONTENDS THAT EVEN IF THE APPLICANT ' S APPOINTMENT TO GRADE A MUST BE REGARDED AS A RECRUITMENT , HE DOES NOT MEET THE CONDITIONS LAID DOWN BY THE DECISION OF JUNE BECAUSE HIS EXPERIENCE HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY LONG . THE COMMISSION HAS ALREADY RECOGNIZED THAT HE HAS SEVEN YEARS '  EXPERIENCE , WHICH WAS ONE OF THE     CONDITIONS OF COMPETITION NO COM/A/. HOWEVER , THE TABLE ANNEXED TO THE DECISION OF JUNE GRANTS ADDITIONAL SENIORITY ONLY IN RESPECT OF PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE OF MORE THAN EIGHT YEARS .   THE PARTIES '  ARGUMENTS MAKE IT NECESSARY TO DEFINE THE SCOPE OF ARTICLE , CONCERNING RECRUITMENT , AND OF ARTICLE CONCERNING THE DETERMINATION OF STEP IN CASES OF PROMOTION TO A HIGHER GRADE .   ACCORDING TO THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE : ' ' AN OFFICIAL SHALL BE RECRUITED AT THE FIRST STEP IN HIS GRADE ' ' . THE SECOND PARAGRAPH ADDS : ' ' HOWEVER , THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY MAY , TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE TRAINING AND SPECIAL EXPERIENCE FOR THE POST OF THE PERSON CONCERNED , ALLOW ADDITIONAL SENIORITY IN HIS GRADE ' ' , WHICH IS LIMITED TO MONTHS , OR TWO STEPS , IN THE GRADE IN QUESTION .   ACCORDING TO THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE , AN OFFICIAL APPOINTED TO A HIGHER GRADE IS TO HAVE , IN HIS NEW GRADE , THE SENIORITY CORRESPONDING TO THE NOTIONAL STEP EQUAL TO OR NEXT ABOVE THE NOTIONAL STEP REACHED IN HIS FORMER GRADE , PLUS THE AMOUNT OF THE TWO-YEARLY INCREMENT FOR HIS NEW GRADE , SUBJECT TO THE PROVISO THAT , ACCORDING TO THE THIRD PARAGRAPH OF THE SAME ARTICLE , AN OFFICIAL APPOINTED TO A HIGHER GRADE IS ALWAYS TO BE CLASSIFIED NOT LOWER THAN THE INITIAL STEP FOR THAT GRADE .   THE PROVISIONS CONCERNING PROMOTIONS , OF WHICH ARTICLE FORMS PART , WHETHER FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THEIR WORDING OR FROM THAT OF THEIR CONTEXT , ARE INTENDED TO GOVERN THE ADVANCEMENT , IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CATEGORIES AND BRANCHES , OF EMPLOYEES OF THE COMMUNITY WHO , AT THE TIME OF THEIR PROMOTION , ALREADY HAVE THE STATUS OF OFFICIALS . THOSE PROVISIONS ARE THUS NOT ADAPTED TO THE POSITION OF AN EMPLOYEE WHO , AFTER A PERIOD OF SERVICE AS A MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF , OBTAINS , BY MEANS OF AN OPEN COMPETITION , HIS FIRST DEFINITIVE APPOINTMENT WITHIN THE COMMUNITY ADMINISTRATION AFTER COMPLETING THE REQUIRED PROBATIONARY PERIOD .       ON THE OTHER HAND , THE APPLICANT ' S CASE IS GOVERNED BY ARTICLE , WHOSE VERY PURPOSE IS TO GOVERN THE POSITION OF AN EMPLOYEE WHO HAS BECOME AN OFFICIAL OF THE COMMUNITY FOR THE FIRST TIME AS A RESULT OF A RECRUITMENT PROCEDURE WHICH WILL NORMALLY HAVE BEEN A COMPETITION .   IT FOLLOWS THAT THE COMMISSION , WHEN IT APPOINTED THE APPLICANT FOLLOWING UPON THE COMPETITION , WAS REQUIRED TO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ADDITIONAL SENIORITY UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE , IN THE LIGHT OF THE CRITERIA LAID DOWN IN ITS DECISION OF JUNE . SINCE THE COMMISSION APPLIED ARTICLE IN DETERMINING THE APPLICANT ' S STEP IN HIS GRADE , IT CANNOT HAVE CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY OF TAKING THE APPLICANT ' S PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE INTO ACCOUNT PURSUANT TO THE AFOREMENTIONED PROVISIONS . THE DECISIONS OF MAY AND DECEMBER MUST THEREFORE BE ANNULLED IN SO FAR AS THEY CONCERN THE APPLICANT ' S CLASSIFICATION IN STEP .   HOWEVER , THE APPLICANT ALSO ASKS THE COURT TO DECLARE THAT HE MUST BE ASSIGNED TO STEP OF GRADE A .    THAT ANCILLARY CLAIM IS INADMISSIBLE INASMUCH AS IT GOES BEYOND THE POWER OF REVIEW CONFERRED ON THE COURT , IN REGARD TO STAFF CASES , BY THE TREATIES AND BY THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   AS THE COURT HAD OCCASION TO EMPHASIZE IN ITS JUDGMENT OF DECEMBER ( CASE 190/BLOMEFIELD V COMMISSION ( ) ECR ), THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY HAS A WIDE DISCRETION , WITHIN THE LIMITS LAID DOWN BY THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE , IN ASSESSING THE PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE OF A PERSON APPOINTED AS AN OFFICIAL BOTH AS REGARDS THE NATURE AND THE DURATION OF THAT EXPERIENCE AND ITS RELATIONSHIP , BE IT CLOSE OR OTHERWISE , TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE POST TO BE FILLED .   IN THIS CASE , IT WILL BE FOR THE COMMISSION TO RECONSIDER THE APPLICANT ' S POSITION AND APPLY TO IT THE CRITERIA LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND THE DECISION OF JUNE WITH A VIEW TO ARRIVING AT A DECISION ON THE APPLICANT ' S CLASSIFICATION IN STEP .
