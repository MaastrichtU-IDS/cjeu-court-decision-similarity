Summary
. As the Court has already held ( see the judgment of January in Case 44/Hurd v Jones (( )) ECR ), the Statute of the European School and the Protocol on the setting-up of European Schools are to be viewed in the context of a whole series of agreements, decisions and other acts by which the Member States collaborate and coordinate their activities so as to contribute to the proper functioning of the Community institutions and to facilitate the achievement of the tasks of those institutions . The unilateral decision of a Member State to reduce the national salary paid to teaching staff seconded to the European Schools entails a corresponding increase in the Communities' share of their financing . For that reason, such a decision interferes with the system adopted for financing the Community and apportioning financial burdens among the Member States .  As the Court has already held ( see the judgment cited above ), consequences of that kind cannot be accepted . The conduct giving rise to them fails to take account of the duty of genuine cooperation and assistance which Member States owe the Community and which finds expression in the obligation laid down in Article of the EEC Treaty to facilitate the achievement of the Community' s tasks and to refrain from jeopardizing the attainment of the objectives of the Treaty .  . As the Court has consistently held, a Member State may not plead provisions, practices or circumstances existing in its own legal system in order to justify a failure to comply with obligations arising under Community law .
