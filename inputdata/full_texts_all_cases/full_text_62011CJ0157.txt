Reference for a preliminary ruling — Tribunale di Napoli — Interpretation of clauses 2, 3, and of the Annex to Council
                  Directive 1999/70/EC of June concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work concluded by ETUC, UNICE and CEEP
                  (OJ L 175, p. 43) — Principle of non‑discrimination — Unemployed persons registered in mobility lists or as job seekers
                  engaged by public authorities for a fixed term carrying out work of social utility/work of public utility (known as socially
                  useful workers/publicly useful workers) — National legislation establishing a difference in treatment in terms of pay between
                  socially useful workers/publicly useful workers and workers engaged under a contract of indefinite duration by the same public
                  authorities performing the same duties.
               
Operative part 
Clause of the framework agreement on fixed-term work concluded on March 1999, which is annexed to Council Directive 1999/70/EC
         of June concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work concluded by ETUC, UNICE and CEEP, must be interpreted
         as not precluding national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which provides that the relationship
         between socially useful workers and the public authorities for whom they carry out their activities does not fall within the
         scope of that framework agreement when, and which it is for the national court to determine, those workers are not covered
         by an employment relationship as defined by national law, collective agreements or practice in force, or the Member States
         and/or social partners have exercised the option granted to them under point of that clause.
