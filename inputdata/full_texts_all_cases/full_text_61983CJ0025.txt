Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE APPLICANT ' S RECLASSIFICATION PURSUANT TO THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION ON THE CRITERIA APPLICABLE TO GRADE AND STEP CLASSIFICATION UPON RECRUITMENT , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON FEBRUARY , ADAM BUICK , AN OFFICIAL OF THE COMMISSION IN GRADE A , BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION OF NOVEMBER REFUSING TO RECLASSIFY HIM IN GRADE A WITH EFFECT FROM HIS TAKING UP DUTY IN JANUARY . HE HAD REQUESTED THIS RECLASSIFICATION UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE ' ' DECISION ON THE CRITERIA APPLICABLE TO GRADE AND STEP CLASSIFICATION UPON RECRUITMENT ' ' , ADOPTED ON JUNE .  THE APPLICANT STARTED WORK FOR THE COMMISSION IN JANUARY AND WAS APPOINTED TO GRADE A , STEP . HE WAS PROMOTED TO GRADE A ON JANUARY .    IN MARCH , THE DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR PERSONNEL AND ADMINISTRATION ISSUED A NOTICE , WHICH HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF ALL THE STAFF OF THE COMMISSION AND ALL SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATES IN COMPETITIONS SINCE THAT DATE ,     COMPRISING THE ABOVE-MENTIONED ' ' DECISION ' '  OF JUNE ( ANNEX I ), A STATEMENT OF THE PRACTICE RELATING TO ITS APPLICATION ( ANNEX II ) AND A LIST DESCRIBING THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE GRADING COMMITTEE , A BODY SET UP UNDER ARTICLE OF THAT ' ' DECISION ' '  ( ANNEX III ).   ARTICLE OF THE ' ' DECISION ' ' , WHICH DEALS WITH APPOINTMENTS TO THE UPPER GRADE IN A CAREER BRACKET , PROVIDES THAT :    ' ' BY WAY OF DEROGATION FROM ARTICLE , THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY MAY , EXCEPTIONALLY AND IN ORDER TO MEET RECRUITMENT REQUIREMENTS , APPOINT A CANDIDATE TO THE UPPER GRADE IN THE STARTING OR INTERMEDIATE CAREER BRACKET , IF THE CANDIDATE GIVES EVIDENCE OF PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE , WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE , OF AT LEAST : . . . EIGHT YEARS FOR GRADE A . . . ' ' .   ARTICLE OF THE ' ' DECISION ' '  PROVIDES THAT :    ' ' PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE SHALL BE CALCULATED FROM THE TIME WHEN THE CANDIDATE WAS AWARDED THE QUALIFICATION GIVING ACCESS PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS TO THE CATEGORY IN WHICH THE POST FALLS . . . ' ' .   PARAGRAPH ( A ) OF ANNEX II TO THE STAFF NOTICE , WHICH RELATES TO THE PRACTICE OBSERVED IN APPLYING THAT ' ' DECISION ' ' , PROVIDES :    ' ' ON A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE GRADING COMMITTEE BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE DURATION OF UNIVERSITY STUDIES VARIES IN THE MEMBER STATES BETWEEN THREE AND EIGHT YEARS , WHICH CAN LEAD TO DISTORTIONS IN GRADING , MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO REDUCE THE GAP IN PRACTICE FROM FIVE YEARS TO TWO YEARS . WHERE UNIVERSITY STUDIES ARE SHORT , PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT ONLY WITH EFFECT FROM THE FOURTH YEAR FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF ADVANCED SECONDARY STUDIES . WHERE UNIVERSITY STUDIES ARE LONG , PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FROM THE SEVENTH SUCH YEAR . ' '   ON READING THE ABOVE-MENTIONED NOTICE OF STAFF , THE APPLICANT SUBMITTED A REQUEST TO THE COMMISSION IN A MEMORANDUM DATED APRIL , ASKING TO BE RECLASSIFIED IN GRADE A WITH EFFECT FROM THE DATE OF HIS RECRUITMENT , IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CRITERIA LAID DOWN IN ANNEXES I AND II , IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT , WHEN HE ENTERED THE SERVICE , HE COULD PROVE EIGHT YEARS PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE , COUNTING FROM DECEMBER , FOUR YEARS AFTER THE COMPLETION OF HIS SECONDARY STUDIES .       IT APPEARS FROM THE DOCUMENTS ON THE FILE OF THE CASE THAT THE APPLICANT COMPLETED HIS SECONDARY STUDIES IN DECEMBER , WHEN HE TOOK THE ENTRANCE EXAMINATION TO OXFORD UNIVERSITY . HOWEVER , HE DID NOT BEGIN HIS UNIVERSITY STUDIES UNTIL OCTOBER , AND OBTAINED HIS UNIVERSITY DEGREE IN JUNE .    ON MAY , THE GRADING COMMITTEE NOTIFIED THE APPLICANT OF ITS OPINION REFUSING HIS REQUEST FOR RECLASSIFICATION ON THE GROUNDS THAT HE COULD NOT SHOW PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE OF SUFFICIENT LENGTH .   ON JUNE , THE APPLICANT LODGED A COMPLAINT WITH THE COMMISSION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , CLAIMING THAT THE GRADING COMMITTEE HAD WRONGLY INTERPRETED THE DECISION OF JUNE .    THAT COMPLAINT WAS REJECTED BY LETTER OF NOVEMBER BY THE MEMBER OF THE COMMISSION IN CHARGE OF PERSONNEL AND ADMINISTRATION , WHO CONFIRMED THE INTERPRETATION OF THE GRADING COMMITTEE .   THAT IS THE DECISION AGAINST WHICH THE APPLICANT BROUGHT THESE PROCEEDINGS ON FEBRUARY .    THE SOLE SUBMISSION PUT FORWARD BY THE APPLICANT ALLEGES THE ILLEGALITY OF THE DECISION REJECTING HIS COMPLAINT , WHICH IS DUE TO A MISINTERPRETATION AND HENCE AN INFRINGEMENT OF THE ' ' DECISION ' '  OF JUNE . HE STRESSES THAT ACCORDING TO THE CLEAR TERMS OF PARAGRAPH OF ANNEX II TO THE NOTICE MENTIONED ABOVE , PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE IS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WITH EFFECT FROM THE FOURTH YEAR FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF SECONDARY STUDIES . THEREFORE IN HIS CASE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FROM DECEMBER , SINCE IT IS COMMON GROUND THAT HE COMPLETED HIS SECONDARY STUDIES IN DECEMBER . EIGHT YEARS '  PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF HIS RECRUITMENT IN JANUARY AND THE APPLICANT SHOULD CONSEQUENTLY HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED IN GRADE A .    AGAINST THIS THE COMMISSION MAINTAINS THAT THE INTERPRETATION ADOPTED BY THE APPLICANT DOES NOT TAKE ACCOUNT OF EITHER THE CONTEXT TO WHICH ANNEX II TO THE NOTICE BELONGS , OR THE GENERAL SCHEME OF THAT ANNEX , AND ABOVE ALL DOES NOT TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE FACT THAT PARAGRAPH ( A ) THEREOF IS JUSTIFIED BY A     CONCERN TO AVOID DISTORTIONS IN CLASSIFICATION BY REDUCING PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE BY ONE YEAR IN THE CASE OF SHORT UNIVERSITY STUDIES , THAT IS TO SAY A COURSE OF STUDY NOT LASTING LONGER THAN THREE YEARS , AND , IN THE CASE OF LONG UNIVERSITY STUDIES , WHICH LAST FOR LONGER THAN SIX YEARS , BY REGARDING THEM AS EQUIVALENT TO PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE . ACCORDING TO THAT APPROACH , THE COMMISSION CONSIDERS THAT THE APPLICANT , ON ENTRY INTO THE SERVICE , DID NOT HAVE EIGHT YEARS '  PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE .   AS THE COURT HAS ALREADY HAD OCCASION TO DECLARE , THE ' ' DECISION ' '  ON THE CRITERIA APPLICABLE TO GRADE AND STEP CLASSIFICATION CONTAINED IN ANNEX I OF THE NOTICE TO STAFF IS AN INTERNAL DIRECTIVE WHICH SHOULD BE REGARDED AS A RULE OF CONDUCT INDICATING THE PRACTICE TO BE FOLLOWED , WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION IMPOSES ON ITSELF AND FROM WHICH IT MAY NOT DEPART WITHOUT SPECIFYING THE REASONS WHICH HAVE LED IT TO DO SO , SINCE OTHERWISE THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY OF TREATMENT WOULD BE INFRINGED ( JUDGMENTS OF DECEMBER IN CASE 190/BLOMEFIELD ( ) ECR ; CASE 343/MICHAEL ( ) ECR ). THE SAME CONSIDERATIONS MUST APPLY WITH REGARD TO THE LEGAL NATURE OF ANNEX II TO THE NOTICE , ENTITLED ' ' PRACTICAL APPLICATION - GENERAL SURVEY ' ' , WHICH BRIEFLY DESCRIBES THE ' ' PRACTICE ' '  OF THE ADMINISTRATION IN APPLYING THE PROVISIONS LAID DOWN IN THE ' ' DECISION ' '  IN QUESTION , BY SETTING FORTH MORE SPECIFIC RULES WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERS ITSELF BOUND TO OBSERVE .   THE WORDING OF THE DISPUTED PARAGRAPH ( A ) SHOWS THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE COMMISSION , WHEN IT ADOPTED THE RULES THEREIN CONTAINED , WAS TO COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , WHICH LAYS DOWN THAT : ' ' IDENTICAL CONDITIONS OF RECRUITMENT AND SERVICE CAREER SHALL APPLY TO ALL OFFICIALS BELONGING TO THE SAME CATEGORY OR THE SAME SERVICE ' ' . IT FOLLOWS THAT THE DISPUTED PROVISION SHOULD BE INTERPRETED IN THE LIGHT OF THE GENERAL SCHEME OF THE MEASURE AND OF THE PURPOSE MENTIONED ABOVE .   AGAINST THAT BACKGROUND , IT MUST BE STATED THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF THE ' ' DECISION ' '  HAS BROUGHT TO LIGHT CONSIDERABLE DISPARITIES WHICH ARE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN THE DURATION OF UNIVERSITY STUDIES BETWEEN MEMBER STATES , AND THAT IT WAS IN ORDER TO REDUCE SUCH DISPARITIES THAT THE COMMISSION ' S GRADING COMMITTEE PROCEEDED TO ESTABLISH THE SCHEME LAID OUT IN PARAGRAPH ( A ) OF ANNEX II TO THE STAFF NOTICE . IT MUST THEREFORE BE CONCLUDED THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE PROVISIONS MENTIONED ABOVE WAS TO DEFINE THE LENGTH OF THE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FOR PURPOSES OF CLASSIFICATION AS STARTING TO RUN FROM THE ACTUAL COMMENCEMENT OF UNIVERSITY STUDIES .       IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES , THE APPLICANT CANNOT RELY ON THE WORDING USED IN PARAGRAPH ( A ) OF ANNEX II TO THE STAFF NOTICE , WHICH IS TO BE EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT , IN GENERAL , UNIVERSITY STUDIES BEGIN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE COMPLETION OF SECONDARY STUDIES , AS THE COMMISSION HAS RIGHTLY OBSERVED . AS THE COMMISSION ALSO CORRECTLY EMPHASIZES , THE LITERAL INTERPRETATION OF THE PROVISION IN QUESTION WOULD LEAD TO ABSURD RESULTS BY TREATING AS YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE PERIODS OF INACTIVITY OR EXPERIENCE WITH NO RELEVANCE TO THE DUTIES PERFORMED .   IT FOLLOWS FROM THE FOREGOING THAT THE SOLE SUBMISSION ADVANCED BY THE APPLICANT CANNOT BE ACCEPTED AND , CONSEQUENTLY , THAT THE APPLICATION MUST BE YYDISMISSED .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .   THE APPLICANT HAS FAILED IN HIS SUBMISSION .   HOWEVER , IN VIEW OF THE WORDING OF THE PROVISION IN QUESTION , THE APPLICANT MIGHT WELL , AS THE COMMISSION HAS CONCEDED , HAVE BEEN MISLED AS TO THE EXTENT OF HIS RIGHTS ; IT IS THEREFORE APPROPRIATE TO APPLY THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE AND TO ORDER THE DEFENDANT TO BEAR THE COSTS IN THEIR ENTIRETY .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ( THIRD CHAMBER )   HEREBY :   . DISMISSES THE APPLICATION ;      . ORDERS THE DEFENDANT TO BEAR THE WHOLE OF THE COSTS .
