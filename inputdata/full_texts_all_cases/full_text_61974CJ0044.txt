Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT OF THE COMMISSION'S DECISIONS TO MAKE DEDUCTIONS FROM THE APPLICANTS' SALARIES ON THE GROUND OF STRIKE ACTION, 
Grounds
THE PRESENT ACTIONS, BROUGHT BY A NUMBER OF OFFICIALS OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, SEEK THE ANNULMENT OF THE COMMISSION'S DECISIONS OF SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER 1973, IN IMPLEMENTATION OF WHICH A DEDUCTION WAS MADE FROM THEIR SALARY FOR THE MONTH OF OCTOBER BY REASON OF THEIR PARTICIPATION IN STRIKE ACTION DURING DECEMBER .  THE DEDUCTION WAS MADE AT A RATE OF ONE-THIRTIETH OF THE MONTHLY REMUNERATION PER DAY ON STRIKE, ALTHOUGH AN 'EXCEPTION' WAS MADE FOR THREE DAYS OF THE STRIKE .  ADMISSIBILITY  IT IS THE COMMISSION'S MAJOR CONTENTION THAT THE ACTIONS ARE INADMISSIBLE .  REGARDING THE MEASURE ADOPTED ON SEPTEMBER 1973, WHICH THE APPLICANTS CONSIDER TO BE A DECISION, THE COMMISSION CLAIMS THAT IT WAS INTENDED MERELY TO PUBLICIZE THE DETAILED RULES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS DECISION OF MARCH CONCERNING DEDUCTIONS TO BE MADE IN RESPECT OF DAYS ON STRIKE, AND THAT IN ANY EVENT THAT MEASURE WAS NOT THE SUBJECT OF A COMPLAINT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  IN SO FAR AS THE ACTIONS ARE DIRECTED AGAINST THE INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS OF OCTOBER THE COMMISSION CONTENDS THAT THEY ARE INADMISSIBLE ON THE GROUND THAT THOSE DECISIONS WERE MERELY TAKEN IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DECISION OF MARCH AND OF A GENERAL DECISION OF DECEMBER 1970, AGAINST WHICH THE APPLICANTS DID NOT ENTER ANY FORMAL OBJECTION OF ILLEGALITY .  THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THE ACTIONS IS TO OBTAIN THE ANNULMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS TAKEN WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICANTS .  IN THE CONTEXT OF THE RIGHT OF ACTION MADE AVAILABLE BY ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND IN THE CASE OF A MEASURE OF A GENERAL NATURE DESIGNED TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY MEANS OF A SERIES OF INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS AFFECTING ALL OR A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE OFFICIALS OF AN INSTITUTION, AN OFFICIAL TAKEN INDIVIDUALLY CANNOT BE DEPRIVED OF HIS RIGHT TO INVOKE THE ILLEGALITY OF THAT MEASURE IN ORDER TO ATTACK THE INDIVIDUAL DECISION WHICH ALONE ALLOWS HIM CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE OF THE MANNER IN WHICH AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH HIS INDIVIDUAL INTERESTS ARE AFFECTED .  THEREFORE THE OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY PUT FORWARD BY THE COMMISSION SEEKS UNJUSTIFIABLY TO PUT AN OBSTACLE IN THE WAY OF THE EXERCISE, BY OFFICIALS, OF THEIR ENTITLEMENT TO ENFORCE THEIR RIGHTS BEFORE THE COURT .  THE OBJECTION MUST THEREFORE BE DISMISSED .  THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CASE  THE APPLICANTS ARE CHALLENGING THE LEGALITY OF DEDUCTIONS MADE FROM THEIR SALARY AS A RESULT OF THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE STRIKE OF DECEMBER .  IT MUST FIRST BE ASCERTAINED WHETHER, AS A GENERAL RULE, AN OFFICIAL WHO HAS TAKEN PART IN A GENERAL STOPPAGE OF WORK DESCRIBED AS A STRIKE IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE SALARY IN THE ABSENCE OF SERVICE RENDERED .  ON THIS POINT, ACCORDING TO A PRINCIPLE RECOGNIZED IN THE LABOUR LAW OF THE MEMBER STATES, WAGES AND OTHER BENEFITS PERTAINING TO DAYS ON STRIKE ARE NOT DUE TO PERSONS WHO HAVE TAKEN PART IN THAT STRIKE .  THIS PRINCIPLE MAY BE APPLIED TO RELATIONS BETWEEN THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE COMMUNITIES AND THEIR OFFICIALS, AS THE COMMISSION HAS ALREADY STATED ON A PREVIOUS OCCASION, IN ITS DECISION OF DECEMBER 1970, ACCORDING TO WHICH 'IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THERE CAN BE NO PAYMENT FOR DAYS ON STRIKE '.  THAT STATEMENT IN NO WAY IMPLIES ANY DECISION IN RELATION TO THE EXISTENCE OF AN OFFICIAL'S RIGHT TO STRIKE OR IN RELATION TO THE DETAILED RULES WHICH MAY GOVERN THE EXERCISE OF SUCH A RIGHT .  ALTHOUGH CERTAIN MEMBER STATES DENY THEIR PUBLIC SERVANTS OR CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF PUBLIC SERVANTS THE RIGHT TO STRIKE, WHEREAS OTHER MEMBER STATES ALLOW IT, THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES REMAIN SILENT ON THE SUBJECT .  IN THE PRESENT CASE IT IS SUFFICIENT TO NOTE THAT THE COLLECTIVE STOPPAGE OF WORK IN RELATION TO WHICH THE DECISIONS IN DISPUTE WERE TAKEN WAS CONSIDERED BY ALL CONCERNED TO BE A METHOD OF DEFENDING COLLECTIVE INTERESTS OF THE STAFF AND WAS THEREFORE DESCRIBED AS STRIKE ACTION .  HOWEVER, THE APPLICANTS MAINTAIN THAT THE DEDUCTIONS ARE CONTRARY TO ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS, ACCORDING TO WHICH ANY UNAUTHORIZED ABSENCE SHALL BE DEDUCTED FROM THE ANNUAL LEAVE OF THE OFFICIAL CONCERNED .  AS HAS ALREADY BEEN NOTED, IT IS COMMON GROUND THAT THE STOPPAGE IN DECEMBER WAS A COLLECTIVE ACTION UNDERTAKEN BY THE OFFICIALS CONCERNED FOR THE DEFENCE OF THEIR INTERESTS .  IT FOLLOWS THAT PARTICIPATION IN THE STRIKE FALLS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF ARTICLE .  THE APPLICANTS FURTHER CLAIM THAT THE DEDUCTIONS ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF TITLE VI OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS CONCERNING DISCIPLINARY MEASURES .  HOWEVER, THE DEDUCTIONS WERE MADE NOT AS A PUNISHMENT FOR A DISCIPLINARY OFFENCE BUT MERELY AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF FAILURE TO PERFORM DUTIES; ACCORDINGLY, THE PROVISIONS OF TITLE VI ARE INAPPLICABLE IN THIS CASE .  THE FACT THAT THE COMMISSION MADE AN EXCEPTION FOR THREE DAYS OF THE STRIKE IN RESPECT OF WHICH NO DEDUCTION WAS MADE DOES NOT ALTER THIS FACT .  THIS MEASURE, WHICH WAS ADOPTED IN FAVOUR OF ALL OFFICIALS WHO TOOK PART IN THE STOPPAGE, WHATEVER THE DATE ON WHICH THEY WERE ABSENT, WAS NOT IN FACT INTENDED MERELY TO APPLY TO THOSE WHO DID NOT ANSWER THE COMMISSION'S CALL TO ITS STAFF TO RETURN TO WORK AFTER THE FIRST THREE DAYS OF THE STRIKE .  IT CANNOT THEREFORE BE CONSIDERED A DISCIPLINARY MEASURE, ALBEIT DISGUISED, DIRECTED AGAINST THEM .  FINALLY, THE APPLICANTS MAINTAIN THAT THEY ARE THE VICTIMS OF DISCRIMINATION ON THE PART OF THE COMMISSION, SINCE NO DEDUCTIONS WERE MADE FROM THE SALARIES OF OFFICIALS OF OTHER INSTITUTIONS OF THE COMMUNITIES WHO TOOK PART IN THE STRIKE .  THE CONTESTED DECISIONS CANNOT BE INVALIDATED BY THE FACT THAT THE OTHER INSTITUTIONS CHOSE NOT TO TAKE MEASURES WHICH THEY COULD LAWFULLY HAVE ADOPTED .  PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS ANY SUM OVERPAID TO AN OFFICIAL SHALL BE RECOVERED IF THE RECIPIENT WAS AWARE THAT THERE WAS NO DUE REASON FOR THE PAYMENT OR IF THE FACT OF THE OVERPAYMENT WAS PATENTLY SUCH THAT HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNAWARE OF IT .  IT IS CLEAR FROM THE FOREGOING THAT THE ABSENCE OF ENTITLEMENT TO PAYMENT FOR DAYS ON STRIKE WAS SO EVIDENT THAT THE CONDITIONS OF ARTICLE HAVE BEEN FULFILLED IN THIS CASE .  SINCE THAT ARTICLE DOES NOT FIX A TIME-LIMIT FOR RECOVERY OF THE UNDUE PAYMENT, THE DELAY WHICH OCCURRED BETWEEN THE STRIKE AND THE MAKING OF THE DEDUCTIONS IS NOT SO EXCESSIVE AS TO INVALIDATE THE DECISIONS IN DISPUTE .  THE ACTIONS MUST THEREFORE BE DISMISSED .  
Decision on costs
THE APPLICANTS HAVE FAILED IN THEIR ACTIONS .  ACCORDING TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY SHALL BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .  HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, IN PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY OFFICIALS OF THE COMMUNITIES, INSTITUTIONS SHALL BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .  
Operative part
THE COURT  HEREBY :  . DISMISSES THE ACTIONS;  . ORDERS THE PARTIES TO BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .
