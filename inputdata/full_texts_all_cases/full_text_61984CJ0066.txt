Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION OF JANUARY IMPOSING A FINE ON THE APPLICANT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY IS VOID OR ALTERNATIVELY FOR THE AMENDMENT OF THAT DECISION , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON MARCH , FERRIERE DI BORGARO SPA , WHOSE REGISTERED OFFICE IS AT BORGARO TORINESE , BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION OF JANUARY CONCERNING A FINE IMPOSED UNDER ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY IS VOID OR ALTERNATIVELY FOR THE AMENDMENT OF THAT DECISION .   THE CONTESTED DECISION STATES IN ARTICLE THAT ' THE EXCEEDING BY TONNES OF THE PRODUCTION QUOTA FOR CATEGORY VI PRODUCTS NOTIFIED TO FERRIERE DI BORGARO SPA FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF CONSTITUTES AN INFRINGEMENT OF DECISION NO 1831/81/ECSC '  AND IN ARTICLE CONSEQUENTLY FINES THE UNDERTAKING ECU , OR LIT .    IT SHOULD BE POINTED OUT THAT COMMISSION DECISION NO 1831/OF JUNE ESTABLISHING FOR UNDERTAKINGS IN THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY A MONITORING SYSTEM AND A NEW SYSTEM OF PRODUCTION QUOTAS IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) RELAXED THE SYSTEM OF STEEL PRODUCTION QUOTAS ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED BY COMMISSION DECISION NO 2794/OF OCTOBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) IN SO FAR AS ONLY THE PRODUCTION OF CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF ROLLED PRODUCTS EXCLUDING CRUDE STEEL PRODUCTION REMAINED SUBJECT TO THE QUOTA SYSTEM .   FERRIERE DI BORGARO PRODUCES SPECIAL STEELS AND ORDINARY STEEL BILLETS OF LESS THAN MM THICKNESS . UNDER THE SYSTEM ESTABLISHED BY DECISION NO 2794/, IT MISTAKENLY DECLARED THE BILLETS IN QUESTION IN ITS QUOTA FOR CRUDE STEEL AND NOT IN ITS QUOTA FOR ROLLED PRODUCTS . CONSEQUENTLY , UNDER THE SYSTEM ESTABLISHED BY DECISION NO 1831/IT WAS ALLOCATED A PRODUCTION QUOTA FOR MERCHANT BARS WHICH WAS MUCH LOWER THAN ITS PREVIOUS PRODUCTION . MORE SPECIFICALLY , FOR THE QUARTER IN QUESTION , THE FIRST QUARTER OF , ITS PRODUCTION QUOTA WAS FIXED AT TONNES AND THE PROPORTION OF PRODUCTION WHICH COULD BE DELIVERED ON THE COMMON MARKET AT TONNES .       CONSIDERING THOSE QUANTITIES INADEQUATE , THE UNDERTAKING ASKED FOR THEM TO BE INCREASED IN TELEX MESSAGES SENT ON , AND JANUARY AND AND MARCH . HOWEVER , THE COMMISSION DID NOT COMPLY WITH THAT REQUEST UNTIL APRIL BY A DECISION INCREASING THE PRODUCTION QUOTA TO TONNES AND THE PROPORTION OF PRODUCTION WHICH COULD BE DELIVERED ON THE COMMON MARKET TO TONNES . THAT AMENDMENT WAS PRECEDED BY AN ON-THE-SPOT CHECK OF THE APPLICANT ' S DECLARATIONS MADE BY THE COMMISSION ' S INSPECTORS ON FEBRUARY .    THE PRODUCTION QUANTITIES WERE NOT THEREFORE FIXED CORRECTLY UNTIL AFTER THE QUARTER IN QUESTION HAD ENDED . IN THE MEANTIME , THE APPLICANT HAD EXCEEDED ITS PRODUCTION QUOTA FOR THAT QUARTER BY TONNES , AS WAS FOUND IN THE CONTESTED DECISION . HOWEVER , THE APPLICANT THEN RESTRICTED ITS PRODUCTION SO THAT IT STAYED TONNES BELOW ITS PRODUCTION QUOTA FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF THAT YEAR .   THE CONSIDERATIONS ON WHICH THE COMMISSION BASED THE CONTESTED DECISION FINING THE APPLICANT , AS STATED IN THE PREAMBLE THERETO , ARE THAT ' THE PRODUCTION QUOTA FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF AND THE PROPORTION OF THAT QUOTA WHICH MAY BE DELIVERED ON THE COMMON MARKET WERE INITIALLY FIXED BY THE COMMISSION ON THE BASIS OF PRODUCTION AND REFERENCE QUANTITIES WHICH WERE INCORRECTLY STATED BY BORGARO - A FACT WHICH MAKES IT LIABLE TO THE FINES AND PERIODIC PENALTY PAYMENTS PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY ; THE INCORRECT DECLARATION CANNOT BE REGARDED AS AN ACCIDENTAL AND ISOLATED EVENT SINCE FROM JULY IT HAS CEASED DECLARING ITS PRODUCTION FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE LEVY AND NO LONGER PAYS THE LEVY , WHICH HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF A COMMISSION DECISION OF JUNE REQUIRING THE UNDERTAKING TO PAY THE SUMS DUE UNDER THE PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE ECSC LEVY ' .   ON THE QUESTION OF THE AMOUNT OF THE FINE , THE PREAMBLE FIRST STATES THAT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY IT MAY BE EQUAL TO THE VALUE OF THE EXCESS PRODUCTION . IT THEN STATES THAT UNDER ARTICLE OF DECISION NO 1831/, THE FINE IS GENERALLY TO BE ECU FOR EACH TONNE IN EXCESS AND THAT THE FINE MAY BE UP TO DOUBLE THAT AMOUNT IF AN UNDERTAKING ' S PRODUCTION EXCEEDS ITS QUOTA BY 10% OR MORE OR IF THE UNDERTAKING HAS ALREADY EXCEEDED ITS QUOTA OR QUOTAS DURING ONE OF THE PREVIOUS QUARTERS .   THE PREAMBLE TO THE CONTESTED DECISION GOES ON TO STATE THAT IN THE CASE OF UNDERTAKINGS WITH A NEGATIVE BALANCE SHEET THE FINE SHOULD BE INCREASED BY 10% TO 82.ECU FOR EACH TONNE IN EXCESS IF THE UNDERTAKING HAS ALREADY EXCEEDED ITS QUOTA OR QUOTAS DURING ONE OF THE PREVIOUS QUARTERS OR IF IT HAS EXCEEDED ITS QUOTAS BY 10% OR MORE . WITH REGARD TO THE PRESENT CASE , IT IS STATED THAT ' IN VIEW OF THE UNDERTAKING ' S STATE OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF AND ITS WILLINGNESS TO OFFSET THE EXCESS PRODUCTION OF THE FIRST QUARTER AND THEREFORE TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION TO SOME EXTENT , THE FINE IMPOSED FOR THE EXCESS PRODUCTION WHICH WAS OFFSET , NAMELY TONNES , SHOULD BE CALCULATED AT THE RATE OF 41.ECU PER TONNE , THAT IS AT HALF THE RATE APPLICABLE TO THE EXCESS PRODUCTION WHICH WAS NOT OFFSET , NAMELY TONNES ' .   IN THIS ACTION , THE APPLICANT SEEKS TO HAVE THE CONTESTED DECISION FIXING THE FINE DECLARED VOID AND IN THE ALTERNATIVE TO HAVE THE FINE REDUCED . TO THAT END IT ADVANCES TWO SUBMISSIONS ALLEGING MISUSE OF POWER AND THE MANIFEST INJUSTICE OF THE DECISION .  MISUSE OF POWERS   ON THIS QUESTION , FERRIERE DI BORGARO CONTENDS THAT THE COMMISSION HAS , BY MEANS OF A DECISION IMPOSING A PENALTY FOR EXCEEDING A QUOTA , SOUGHT IN FACT TO PENALIZE AN INFRINGEMENT CONCERNING THE LEVY AND THE DUTY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION . IT ARGUES THAT THIS IS CLEAR FROM THE RECITALS OF THE PREAMBLE TO THE DECISION WHICH LINK THE FINDINGS RELATING TO THE INCORRECT DECLARATIONS OF PRODUCTION AND REFERENCE QUANTITIES TO THE FINDINGS THAT THE APPLICANT HAS ALSO FAILED TO DECLARE ITS PRODUCTION FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE LEVY AND HAS STOPPED PAYING THE LEVY .   THE COMMISSION , ON THE OTHER HAND , STATES THAT THOSE RECITALS SHOW IN FACT THAT THE INFRINGEMENTS CONCERNING THE LEVY AND THE DUTY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION WERE THE SUBJECT OF A SEPARATE DECISION . IN THE PASSAGE IN QUESTION IT SIMPLY WISHED TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THE INITIAL ALLOCATION OF INCORRECT QUOTAS WAS THE FAULT OF THE APPLICANT ITSELF WHICH HAD FAILED TO PROVIDE CORRECT INFORMATION .   IT IS CLEAR FROM THE ACTUAL WORDING OF THE RECITAL IN QUESTION , QUOTED ABOVE , THAT THE RECITAL WAS MEANT TO SUPPORT THE FINDING THAT THE INITIAL INCORRECT FIXING OF THE PRODUCTION QUOTA WAS THE DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE APPLICANT ' S FAILURE TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS REGARDING THE DECLARATION OF ITS PRODUCTION . INDEED , THE REFERENCE TO THE DECISION OF JUNE , WHICH WAS ADOPTED IN ORDER TO PENALIZE THE BREACH OF OBLIGATIONS CONCERNING PAYMENT OF THE LEVY , SHOWS PRECISELY THAT THAT BREACH WAS NOT THE SUBJECT OF THE DECISION WHICH IS CHALLENGED IN THIS CASE . IN THOSE CIRCUM    STANCES , IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT THE CONTESTED DECISION HAD A PURPOSE OTHER THAN TO PENALIZE THE EXCEEDING OF THE QUOTA IN QUESTION .   THIS SUBMISSION MUST THEREFORE BE REJECTED .  MANIFEST INJUSTICE OF THE DECISION   SECONDLY , AS FAR AS CONCERNS THE SUBMISSION THAT THE DECISION IS MANIFESTLY UNJUST , FERRIERE DI BORGARO CONTENDS THAT THE COMMISSION FAILED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE QUOTA WAS EXCEEDED AND IN PARTICULAR THE FACT THAT THE EXCESS WAS IMPUTABLE TO THE COMMISSION . IT ARGUES FIRST OF ALL THAT IT WAS NOT CLEAR HOW BILLETS OF LESS THAN MM THICKNESS WERE TO BE CLASSIFIED UNDER THE SYSTEM ESTABLISHED BY DECISION NO 2794/; WHAT IS MORE , THE COMMISSION ' S INSPECTORS DID NOT DRAW ITS ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT IT HAD DECLARED THOSE PRODUCTS INCORRECTLY . ITS SECOND POINT IS THAT THE CASES IN WHICH UNDERTAKINGS ARE EXEMPT FROM THE QUOTA SYSTEM ARE NOT CLEARLY DEFINED IN THE COMMUNITY PROVISIONS AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY IT COULD NOT HAVE KNOWN THAT IT WAS REQUIRED TO DECLARE ITS PRODUCTION . FINALLY , THE APPLICANT COMPLAINS THAT THE COMMISSION DID NOT TAKE SUFFICIENT ACCOUNT OF THE FACT THAT , IN SPITE OF REPEATED REQUESTS , THE DECISION RECTIFYING THE MATTER WAS NOT ADOPTED UNTIL AFTER THE RELEVANT QUARTER HAD EXPIRED .   THE COMMISSION , ON THE OTHER HAND , ARGUES THAT THE APPLICANT IS PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR EXCEEDING ITS QUOTA : ITS INCORRECT DECLARATIONS AS TO THE NATURE OF ITS PRODUCTION WERE THE CAUSE OF THE INITIAL INCORRECT ALLOCATION OF ITS QUOTA . THE COMMUNITY RULES ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE PRODUCTS IN QUESTION ARE CLEAR . DECISION NO 2794/REFERS IN THIS REGARD TO EUROSTAT QUESTIONNAIRES NOS 2-AND 2-WHICH IN TURN REFER TO EURONORMS WHICH ARE DISTRIBUTED TO THE UNDERTAKINGS CONCERNED . IT IS ALSO CLEAR FROM THE COMMUNITY LEGISLATION THAT THE APPLICANT DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR EXEMPTION FROM THE QUOTA SYSTEM . FINALLY , THE ARGUMENT THAT THE COMMISSION WAS SLOW TO ADOPT ITS DECISION CANNOT BE ACCEPTED SINCE THE PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS WHICH ELAPSED BETWEEN THE FIRST REQUEST FOR RECTIFICATION AND THE ADOPTION OF THE DECISION RECTIFYING THE MATTER WAS REASONABLE HAVING REGARD IN PARTICULAR TO THE FACT THAT IT WAS FIRST NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT AN ON-THE-SPOT INSPECTION . IN ANY EVENT , BY MARCH AT THE LATEST , THE APPLICANT POSSESSED ALL THE INFORMATION IT NEEDED TO CALCULATE ITS QUOTA ITSELF , AS IS SHOWN BY THE TELEX MESSAGE WHICH IT SENT ON THAT DAY , AND FURTHERMORE THE ATTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH THE ALLEGED DELAY HAD ALREADY BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE DECISION .       IT MUST BE POINTED OUT FIRST OF ALL THAT UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF DECISION NO 2794/THE APPLICANT WAS REQUIRED - AND THIS IS NOT DISPUTED - TO DECLARE ITS STEEL PRODUCTION TO THE COMMISSION AND TO SPECIFY THE PROPORTION OF ITS PRODUCTION CONSISTING OF CRUDE STEEL AND THE PROPORTION CONSISTING OF ROLLED PRODUCTS . IT MUST THEREFORE BEAR THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY INCORRECT DECLARATION , REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT IS THE QUANTITY OF ITS TOTAL PRODUCTION OR ITS BREAKDOWN INTO THE VARIOUS GROUPS OF PRODUCTS THAT IS GIVEN INCORRECTLY . IT CANNOT ESCAPE THAT RESPONSIBILITY BY CLAIMING THAT THE COMMISSION ' S INSPECTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT THE COMMUNITY RULES ARE OBSERVED DID NOT NOTICE FROM THE OUTSET THAT ITS DECLARATIONS WERE INCORRECT .   NOR CAN THE APPLICANT ESCAPE OR REDUCE ITS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF ITS INCORRECT DECLARATIONS BY ARGUING THAT THE COMMUNITY LEGISLATION DOES NOT MAKE IT SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR HOW THE BILLETS IN QUESTION ARE TO BE CLASSIFIED . IT IS IN FACT CLEAR FROM THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE COMMISSION AND NOT DISPUTED BY THE APPLICANT THAT , THROUGH THE REFERENCE TO EUROSTAT QUESTIONNAIRES NOS 2-AND 2-, DECISION NO 2794/IS REFERRING TO EURONORMS AND THAT THOSE STANDARDS , WHICH HAD BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO THE UNDERTAKINGS CONCERNED , SHOW THAT STEEL BILLETS OF LESS THAN MM THICKNESS ARE ROLLED PRODUCTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF ANNEXES I AND II/TO DECISION NO 2794/AND NOT CRUDE STEEL WITHIN THE MEANING OF ANNEX II/TO THAT DECISION .   NOR CAN THE APPLICANT RELY ON THE FACT - WHICH IS DISPUTED BY THE COMMISSION - THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR IT TO TAKE THE VIEW THAT IT WAS NOT SUBJECT TO THE QUOTA SYSTEM BEFORE THE FIRST QUARTER OF . THAT ARGUMENT CANNOT BE ACCEPTED SINCE THE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE INFORMATION IS INDEPENDENT OF THE EXEMPTION . IN FACT , ARTICLE OF DECISION NO 1831/, AS AMENDED BY DECISION NO 1832/, EXPRESSLY PROVIDES THAT THE EXEMPTION FROM THE QUOTA SYSTEM APPLIES ' WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE OBLIGATIONS WITH REGARD TO INFORMATION AND CHECKS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS DECISION ' .   HOWEVER , AS REGARDS THE ARGUMENT THAT THE DECISION TO RECTIFY THE PRODUCTION QUOTA WAS ADOPTED AFTER UNDUE DELAY , IT MUST BE ACCEPTED THAT , ALTHOUGH , AS WAS STATED ABOVE , THE APPLICANT BEARS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ERROR IN THE ORIGINAL QUOTA ALLOCATION , THAT CIRCUMSTANCE CANNOT DISCHARGE THE COMMISSION FROM ITS DUTY TO RECTIFY THE QUOTA AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE ONCE IT HAD BEEN NOTIFIED BY THE APPLICANT OF ITS ERROR AND THE NECESSARY INVESTIGATIONS HAD CONFIRMED THAT AN ERROR HAD BEEN MADE . IN THE PRESENT CASE , THE FIRST REQUEST FOR RECTIFICATION WAS SENT TO THE COMMISSION ON JANUARY AND ON-THE-SPOT INVESTIGATIONS WERE CARRIED OUT BY THE COMMISSION ' S INSPECTORS ON FEBRUARY . HOWEVER , THE RECTIFYING     DECISION WAS NOT ADOPTED UNTIL APRIL , THAT IS TO SAY AFTER THE QUARTER IN QUESTION HAD EXPIRED , THREE MONTHS AFTER THE FIRST REQUEST FOR RECTIFICATION WAS MADE AND NEARLY TWO MONTHS AFTER THE ON-THE-SPOT INSPECTION .   IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES , THE COURT MUST TAKE THE VIEW THAT THE COMMISSION FAILED TO RECTIFY ITS ERRONEOUS DECISION IN GOOD TIME AND THAT THAT FAILURE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE APPLICANT TO PLAN ITS PRODUCTION CORRECTLY SO AS TO AVOID EXCEEDING THE QUOTA ALLOCATED TO IT FOR THE QUARTER IN QUESTION . EVEN ACCEPTING THE COMMISSION ' S ARGUMENT THAT THE APPLICANT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN ABLE , AT LEAST BY MARCH , TO CALCULATE ITS QUOTA ITSELF , THE COMMISSION NONE THE LESS DID NOT GIVE THE APPLICANT ANY APPROPRIATE INDICATION TO THAT EFFECT , THERE BEING NO EVIDENCE ON THE FILE TO SUGGEST THAT , BEFORE NOTIFYING THE RECTIFYING DECISION TO THE APPLICANT , THE COMMISSION ' S OFFICERS INFORMED IT WHAT FINAL QUOTA IT SHOULD EXPECT .   ALTHOUGH THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES DO NOT ALTER THE FACT THAT THE QUOTA EXCESS IN QUESTION CONSTITUTES AN INFRINGEMENT OF THE COMMUNITY RULES AND CANNOT THEREFORE JUSTIFY THE ANNULMENT OF THE CONTESTED DECISION , THEY MAY BE GROUNDS FOR REDUCING THE FINE .   ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF DECISION NO 1831/, THE FINE MUST BE FIXED AT ECU FOR EACH TONNE IN EXCESS EXCEPT IN CERTAIN EXCEPTIONAL CASES - ONE OF WHICH IS WHERE A QUOTA IS EXCEEDED BY 10% OR MORE - JUSTIFYING A DEPARTURE FROM THAT RATE OF FINE . ALTHOUGH THE QUOTA ALLOCATED WAS IN FACT EXCEEDED BY MORE THAN 10% IN THE PRESENT CASE , IT SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE APPLICANT WAS IN A STATE OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE RELEVANT QUARTER OWING TO THE COMMISSION ' S SLOWNESS IN ADOPTING THE RECTIFYING DECISION AND THAT THE APPLICANT CONSIDERABLY REDUCED ITS PRODUCTION IN THE FOLLOWING QUARTER . IN VIEW OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IT SEEMS APPROPRIATE IN PRINCIPLE TO CALCULATE THE FINE AT THE STANDARD RATE , WITHOUT ANY INCREASE , THAT IS TO SAY ECU FOR EACH TONNE OF EXCESS PRODUCTION .   HOWEVER , IN SO FAR AS THE APPLICANT OFFSET THAT EXCESS BY REDUCING ITS PRODUCTION IN THE FOLLOWING QUARTER , IT IS APPROPRIATE IN VIEW OF THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS CASE , WHICH LEFT THE APPLICANT IN A PROLONGED STATE OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ITS QUOTA , TO FINE IT AT A RATE EQUAL TO ONE THIRD OF THE STANDARD RATE FOR THE EXCESS PRODUCTION WHICH WAS OFFSET , NAMELY TONNES , THAT IS TO SAY ECU FOR EACH EXCESS TONNE .   FOR ALL THOSE REASONS THE FINE IMPOSED MUST BE REDUCED TO BY  ECU + BY  ECU WHICH EQUALS ECU ( LIT ) AND THE REST OF THE APPLICATION MUST BE DISMISSED .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY MUST BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS . HOWEVER , UNDER ARTICLE ( ), WHERE EACH PARTY SUCCEEDS ON SOME AND FAILS ON OTHER HEADS , OR WHERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE EXCEPTIONAL , THE COURT MAY ORDER THE PARTIES TO BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS IN WHOLE OR IN PART .   SINCE BOTH THE APPLICANT AND THE COMMISSION HAVE FAILED IN SOME OF THEIR SUBMISSIONS , THEY SHOULD BE ORDERED TO BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ( THIRD CHAMBER )   HEREBY :    ( ) REDUCES THE FINE IMPOSED ON THE APPLICANT TO ECU ( LIT );   ( ) DISMISSES THE REST OF THE APPLICATION ;   ( ) ORDERS THE PARTIES TO BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .
