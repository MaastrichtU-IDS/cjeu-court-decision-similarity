Subject of the case
APPLICATIONS , AT THIS STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS FOR : . THE ANNULMENT OF THE COMMISSION ' S DECISIONS DATED NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER LAYING DOWN , IN THE CASE OF OFFICIALS EMPLOYED IN CONNECTION WITH ' ' INDIRECT ACTIONS ' ' , THE LIST OF OFFICIALS IN CATEGORY A PAID FROM RESEARCH APPROPRIATIONS JUDGED TO BE THE MOST DESERVING OF PROMOTION TO GRADE A FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR AND THE LIST OF OFFICIALS ACTUALLY PROMOTED FOR THAT YEAR , ON THE GROUND THAT THE APPLICANT ' S NAME DID NOT APPEAR ON EITHER LIST ;      . THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE APPLICANT , BY WAY OF COMPENSATION FOR THE DAMAGE SUFFERED BY HIM , IN GRADE A , STEP , AS FROM JANUARY .   
Grounds
IN ITS INTERIM JUDGMENT OF DECEMBER , THE COURT ( SECOND CHAMBER ) TOOK THE VIEW THAT IN CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS THOSE OF THE PRESENT CASE , THE IRREGULARITY IN THE PROMOTION PROCEDURE IN THE CASE OF THE APPLICANT WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN THAT JUDGMENT , NAMELY THE IMPROPER INCLUSION IN THE FILE OF HIS PERIODIC REPORT FOR TO AND THE FACT THAT HIS REPORT FOR TO WAS NOT FINAL , WAS INSUFFICIENT TO INVALIDATE THE PROMOTIONS MADE UNLESS IT WAS ESTABLISHED THAT THE IRREGULARITY IN QUESTION MIGHT HAVE HAD A DECISIVE INFLUENCE ON THE PROMOTION PROCEDURE .   THE DOCUMENTS SUBSEQUENTLY PRODUCED BY THE COMMISSION PERMIT THE FINDING TO BE MADE THAT , EVEN IF THE APPLICANT ' S PERIODIC REPORT FOR TO HAD BEEN AMENDED IN THE SAME MANNER AS HIS REPORT FOR TO , AND EVEN IF THE LATTER REPORT HAD BEEN FINAL WHEN THE PROMOTION PROCEDURE COMPLAINED OF WAS IN PROGRESS , THE ASSESSMENTS AWARDED IN RESPECT OF THOSE PERIODS TO THE     OFFICIALS ACTUALLY PROMOTED WOULD , IN THE AGGREGATE , HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN THOSE AWARDED TO THE APPLICANT . THERE IS NOTHING IN THE DESCRIPTIVE PARTS OF THE FINAL REPORTS TO SUGGEST THAT THE RELEVANT ASSESSMENTS WERE NOT FOUNDED ON AN OBJECTIVE APPRAISAL .   IT HAS THEREFORE NOT BEEN SHOWN THAT THE IRREGULARITY ESTABLISHED BY THE COURT MIGHT HAVE HAD A DECISIVE INFLUENCE ON THE PROMOTION PROCEDURE . FOR THAT REASON , THE COURT CANNOT ACCEPT THE PRINCIPAL SUBMISSIONS RELIED UPON BY THE APPLICANT IN HIS OBSERVATIONS OF AUGUST .    AS REGARDS THE SECONDARY SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPLICANT REQUIRING THE COMMISSION TO PRODUCE ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS , IT MUST BE EMPHASIZED FIRST OF ALL THAT THE APPLICATION IS DIRECTED EXCLUSIVELY AGAINST THE PROMOTION PROCEDURE FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR . IN THAT RESPECT , THE DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE FINANCIAL YEARS AND , THE PRODUCTION OF WHICH IS SOUGHT BY THE APPLICANT , ARE NOT MATERIAL .   SECONDLY , IT MUST BE RECALLED THAT THE SOLE ARGUMENT RELIED UPON BY THE APPLICANT IN HIS APPLICATION IS CONFINED TO HIS PERIODIC REPORTS FOR TO AND FOR TO . THE FACT THAT IN HIS OBSERVATIONS OF AUGUST THE APPLICANT QUESTIONS WHETHER THE PROMOTION BODIES AND THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY HAVE TAKEN SUFFICIENT ACCOUNT OF OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES CONSTITUTES THE RAISING OF A FRESH ISSUE . THAT ISSUE IS NOT BASED ON MATTERS OF LAW OR OF FACT WHICH HAVE COME TO LIGHT IN THE COURSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COURT . THIS MATTER MUST THEREFORE BE DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE .   ON THOSE GROUNDS , IT IS ALSO UNNECESSARY TO UPHOLD THE SECONDARY SUBMISSIONS PUT FORWARD BY THE APPLICANT IN HIS OBSERVATIONS ON AUGUST .   
Decision on costs
UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE , THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS . HOWEVER , UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE , IN PROCEEDINGS BY SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES , INSTITUTIONS ARE TO BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .       AS REGARDS CASE 51/IN WHICH THE APPLICATION WAS DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE BY THE INTERIM JUDGMENT OF DECEMBER , THE PARTIES MUST BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS , PURSUANT TO THE AFORESAID PROVISIONS .   AS REGARDS CASE 156/, THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED THAT THE COMMISSION IS TO BEAR ALL THE COSTS . ACCORDINGLY THE COMMISSION MUST BE ORDERED TO PAY ALL THE COSTS , INCLUDING THOSE OF THE APPLICANT .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ( SECOND CHAMBER )   HEREBY :   . DISMISSES THE APPLICATION IN CASE 156/;  . IN THAT CASE , ORDERS THE COMMISSION TO PAY ALL THE COSTS , INCLUDING THOSE OF THE APPLICANT ;  . IN CASE 51/, IN WHICH THE APPLICATION WAS DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE BY INTERIM JUDGMENT OF DECEMBER , ORDERS THE PARTIES TO BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .
