IN CASE 105/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE VESTRE LANDSRET ( WESTERN DIVISION OF THE DANISH HIGH COURT ) FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE PROCEEDINGS PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  FORENINGEN AF ARBEJDSLEDERE I DANMARK ( ASSOCIATION OF SUPERVISORY STAFF , DENMARK ), ACTING ON BEHALF OF HANS ERIK MIKKELSEN ,   AND  A/S DANMOLS INVENTAR , IN LIQUIDATION ,   
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 77/187/EEC OF FEBRUARY , ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO THE SAFEGUARDING OF EMPLOYEES '  RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF TRANSFERS OF UNDERTAKINGS , BUSINESSES OR PARTS OF BUSINESSES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), 
Grounds
BY A REQUEST DATED APRIL , WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON APRIL , THE VESTRE LANDSRET ( WESTERN DIVISION OF THE DANISH HIGH COURT ) REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY TWO QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE INTERPRETATION OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 77/187/EEC OF FEBRUARY ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO THE SAFEGUARDING OF EMPLOYEES '  RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF TRANSFERS OF UNDERTAKINGS , BUSINESSES OR PARTS OF BUSINESSES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ).  THOSE QUESTIONS WERE RAISED IN PROCEEDINGS INSTITUTED BY THE FORENINGEN AF ARBEJDSLEDERE I DANMARK , ACTING ON BEHALF OF HANS ERIK MIKKELSEN , AGAINST DANMOLS INVENTAR A/S , A COMPANY IN LIQUIDATION .  MR MIKKELSEN WAS EMPLOYED BY DANMOLS INVENTAR A/S AS WORKS FOREMAN . ON SEPTEMBER THAT COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS SUSPENDING PAYMENT OF ITS DEBTS AND DISMISSED MR MIKKELSEN WITH EFFECT FROM DECEMBER .   WITH EFFECT FROM OCTOBER , THE UNDERTAKING WAS TRANSFERRED TO DANMOLS INVENTAR- OG MOEBELFABRIK A/S , A COMPANY IN FORMATION , OF WHICH MR MIKKELSEN BECAME A CO-OWNER , ACQUIRING A 33% SHAREHOLDING AND 50% OF THE VOTING RIGHTS AT THE GENERAL MEETING ; IN ADDITION HE WAS APPOINTED CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS . HE CONTINUED TO CARRY OUT HIS DUTIES AS WORKS FOREMAN IN THE NEW COMPANY , DOING THE SAME WORK AND RECEIVING THE SAME SALARY AS PRIOR TO THE TRANSFER .  ON DECEMBER DANMOLS INVENTAR A/S WAS ADJUDGED INSOLVENT , WHEREUPON MIKKELSEN FILED A CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY FOR COMPENSATION CORRESPONDING TO TWO MONTHS '  PAY , FROM NOVEMBER TO DECEMBER , FOR THE PREMATURE TERMINATION OF HIS EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT , AND FOR HOLIDAY PAY FOR THE PERIOD FROM JANUARY TO OCTOBER .   BY A JUDGMENT OF SEPTEMBER THE BANKRUPTCY COURT RULED THAT MIKKELSEN HAD NO CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY BECAUSE , ' IN THE LIGHT OF THE BACKGROUND TO THE LAW ON THE TRANSFER OF UNDERTAKINGS AND , IN PARTICULAR , THE EEC DIRECTIVE ON WHICH IT IS BASED AND THE EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM TO THE BILL , ARTICLE OF THE LAW MUST BE INTERPRETED TO THE EFFECT THAT THE TRANSFEROR OF THE UNDERTAKING IS RELEASED FROM ALL HIS OBLIGATIONS TOWARDS THE EMPLOYEES OF THE UNDERTAKING SINCE ALL THOSE OBLIGATIONS ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE TRANSFEREE . '  THE DANISH LAW IN QUESTION , NAMELY LAW NO OF MARCH ON THE RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES ON THE TRANSFER OF UNDERTAKINGS , WAS ADOPTED IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 77/OF FEBRUARY .   THAT DIRECTIVE , WHICH WAS ADOPTED ON THE BASIS OF , IN PARTICULAR , ARTICLE OF THE TREATY , IS INTENDED , ACCORDING TO ITS PREAMBLE , ' TO PROVIDE FOR THE PROTECTION OF EMPLOYEES IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE OF EMPLOYER , IN PARTICULAR , TO ENSURE THAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE SAFEGUARDED ' . TO THAT END , ARTICLE ( ) PROVIDES FOR THE TRANSFER OF THE TRANSFEROR ' S RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS ARISING FROM A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT OR FROM AN EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP . ARTICLE ( ) PROVIDES FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE WORKERS CONCERNED AGAINST DISMISSAL BY THE TRANSFEROR OR THE TRANSFEREE WHERE THE DISMISSAL IS DUE SOLELY TO THE TRANSFER . IN ADDITION , ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE REQUIRES THE TRANSFEROR AND THE TRANSFEREE TO INFORM AND CONSULT THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE WORKERS AFFECTED BY THE TRANSFER . FINALLY , ARTICLE PROVIDES THAT THE DIRECTIVE IS NOT TO ' AFFECT THE RIGHT OF MEMBER STATES TO APPLY OR INTRODUCE LAWS , REGULATIONS OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS WHICH ARE MORE FAVOURABLE TO EMPLOYEES ' .  ON APPEAL THE CASE CAME BEFORE THE VESTRE LANDSRET , WHICH TOOK THE VIEW THAT ITS DECISION DEPENDED UPON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE GIVEN TO DIRECTIVE NO 77/. IT THEREFORE STAYED THE PROCEEDINGS AND REFERRED THE CASE TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING ON THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS :    ' MUST THE EXPRESSION ' ' EMPLOYEE ' '  IN COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 77/187/EEC OF FEBRUARY ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO THE SAFEGUARDING OF EMPLOYEES '  RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF TRANSFERS OF UNDERTAKINGS , BUSINESSES OR PARTS OF BUSINESSES BE INTERPRETED TO MEAN THAT IT IS SUFFICIENT FOR THE PERSON CONCERNED TO HAVE BEEN AN EMPLOYEE OF THE TRANSFEROR OR MUST HE ALSO OCCUPY A POSITION AS EMPLOYEE WITH THE TRANSFEREE?   IF THE COURT TAKES THE VIEW THAT THE PERSON CONCERNED MUST ALSO BE AN EMPLOYEE OF THE TRANSFEREE , DOES THE EXPRESSION ' ' EMPLOYEE ' '  CONTAINED IN THE DIRECTIVE COVER A PERSON WHO HAS A 50% INTEREST IN THE COMPANY IN QUESTION?  '  THE APPLICABILITY OF DIRECTIVE NO 77/WHERE AN UNDERTAKING SUSPENDS PAYMENT OF ITS DEBTS  SINCE THE TRANSFER OF THE UNDERTAKING IN QUESTION TOOK PLACE AFTER THE TRANSFEROR HAD ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS SUSPENDING PAYMENT OF ITS DEBTS BUT BEFORE IT WAS ADJUDGED INSOLVENT , IT IS APPROPRIATE TO REFER IN THE FIRST PLACE TO THE JUDGMENT OF FEBRUARY ( CASE 135/, ABELS , ( ) ECR ), IN WHICH THE COURT HELD THAT :    ' ARTICLE ( ) OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 77/187/EEC OF FEBRUARY DOES NOT APPLY TO THE TRANSFER OF AN UNDERTAKING , BUSINESS OR PART OF A BUSINESS WHERE THE TRANSFEROR HAS BEEN ADJUDGED INSOLVENT AND THE UNDERTAKING OR BUSINESS IN QUESTION FORMS PART OF THE ASSETS OF THE INSOLVENT TRANSFEROR , ALTHOUGH THE MEMBER STATES ARE AT LIBERTY TO APPLY THE PRINCIPLES OF THE DIRECTIVE TO SUCH A TRANSFER ON THEIR OWN INITIATIVE . THE DIRECTIVE DOES , HOWEVER , APPLY WHERE AN UNDERTAKING , BUSINESS OR PART OF A BUSINESS IS TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER EMPLOYER IN THE COURSE OF A PROCEDURE SUCH AS A ' ' SURSEANCE VAN BETALING '  ( JUDICIAL LEAVE TO SUSPEND THE PAYMENT OF DEBTS ). '  IT FOLLOWS THAT THE MERE FACT THAT THE TRANSFER OF AN UNDERTAKING , BUSINESS OR PART OF A BUSINESS HAS OCCURRED AFTER THE TRANSFEROR HAS SUSPENDED PAYMENT OF ITS DEBTS IS NOT ENOUGH TO EXCLUDE THE SAID TRANSACTIONS FROM THE SCOPE OF DIRECTIVE NO 77/. IT THEREFORE APPLIES TO A TRANSFER AS DEFINED IN ARTICLE ( ) WHICH IS EFFECTED IN THE COURSE OF A PROCEDURE , OR AT A STAGE , PRIOR TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF LIQUIDATION PROCEEDINGS .  THE FIRST QUESTION  BY THE FIRST QUESTION THE VESTRE LANDSRET ASKS ESSENTIALLY WHETHER ARTICLE ( ) OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 77/OF FEBRUARY MUST BE INTERPRETED AS APPLYING ALSO TO THE TRANSFER OF THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF PERSONS WHO WERE EMPLOYED BY THE TRANSFEROR AT THE DATE OF THE TRANSFER BUT WHO DO NOT CONTINUE TO WORK AS EMPLOYEES OF THE TRANSFEREE .  THE PARTIES TO THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS AND THE COMMISSION SUGGEST THAT THAT QUESTION SHOULD BE ANSWERED IN THE NEGATIVE . THAT FOLLOWS BOTH FROM A LINGUISTIC INTERPRETATION OF THE PROVISION AND FROM AN INTERPRETATION BASED ON THE OBJECTIVES OF THE DIRECTIVE . THE ACTUAL WORDING OF THE PROVISION IN QUESTION SHOWS THAT IT APPLIES ONLY WHERE THERE IS A CHANGE OF EMPLOYER , IN OTHER WORDS WHERE THE PERSON CONCERNED CONTINUES AS AN EMPLOYEE OF THE TRANSFEREE . THAT CONCLUSION IS IN THEIR VIEW SUPPORTED BY REFERENCE TO THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE , WHICH IS TO ENSURE THE CONTINUITY OF THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP OF THE EMPLOYEE VIS-A-VIS THE PERSON ACQUIRING THE UNDERTAKING .  IT MUST BE NOTED THAT , ACCORDING TO THE FIRST SUB-PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE DIRECTIVE , ' THE TRANSFEROR ' S RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS ARISING FROM A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT OR FROM AN EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP EXISTING ON THE DATE OF A TRANSFER WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) SHALL , BY REASON OF SUCH TRANSFER , BE TRANSFERRED TO THE TRANSFEREE ' . THE SECOND SUB-PARAGRAPH STATES HOWEVER THAT ' MEMBER STATES MAY PROVIDE THAT , AFTER THE DATE OF TRANSFER WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) AND IN ADDITION TO THE TRANSFEREE , THE TRANSFEROR SHALL CONTINUE TO BE LIABLE IN RESPECT OF OBLIGATIONS WHICH AROSE FROM A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT OR AN EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP ' . MOREOVER , ACCORDING TO ARTICLE ( ) ' THE TRANSFEREE SHALL CONTINUE TO OBSERVE THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AGREED IN ANY COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT ON THE SAME TERMS APPLICABLE TO THE TRANSFEROR UNDER THAT AGREEMENT , UNTIL THE DATE OF TERMINATION OR EXPIRY OF THE COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT OR THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OR APPLICATION OF ANOTHER COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT ' .  IN THIS CONNECTION IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO REFER TO ARTICLE ( ) OF DIRECTIVE NO 77/, WHICH PROVIDES THAT ' THE TRANSFER OF AN UNDERTAKING , BUSINESS OR PART OF A BUSINESS SHALL NOT IN ITSELF CONSTITUTE GROUNDS FOR DISMISSAL BY THE TRANSFEROR OR THE TRANSFEREE ' . HOWEVER , THAT PROVISION IS NOT TO ' STAND IN THE WAY OF DISMISSALS THAT MAY TAKE PLACE FOR ECONOMIC , TECHNICAL OR ORGANIZATIONAL REASONS ENTAILING CHANGES IN THE WORK-FORCE . '  TAKEN TOGETHER THOSE PROVISIONS SHOW THAT THE DIRECTIVE IS INTENDED TO SAFEGUARD THE RIGHTS OF WORKERS IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE OF EMPLOYER BY MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO WORK FOR THE TRANSFEREE UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS AS THOSE AGREED WITH THE TRANSFEROR . AS THE COURT STATED IN ITS JUDGMENT OF FEBRUARY ( CASE 19/, WENDELBOE ( ) ECR ), IT IS INTENDED TO ENSURE , AS FAR AS POSSIBLE , THAT THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP CONTINUES UNCHANGED WITH THE TRANSFEREE , IN PARTICULAR BY OBLIGING THE TRANSFEREE TO CONTINUE TO OBSERVE THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT ARTICLE ( )) AND BY PROTECTING WORKERS AGAINST DISMISSALS MOTIVATED SOLELY BY THE FACT OF TRANSFER ( ARTICLE ( )).  THE PROTECTION WHICH THE DIRECTIVE IS INTENDED TO GUARANTEE IS HOWEVER REDUNDANT WHERE THE PERSON CONCERNED DECIDES OF HIS OWN ACCORD NOT TO CONTINUE THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NEW EMPLOYER AFTER THE TRANSFER . THAT IS THE CASE WHERE THE EMPLOYEE IN QUESTION TERMINATES THE EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT OR EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP OF HIS OWN FREE WILL WITH EFFECT FROM THE DATE OF THE TRANSFER , OR WHERE THAT CONTRACT OR RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED WITH EFFECT FROM THE DATE OF THE TRANSFER BY VIRTUE OF AN AGREEMENT VOLUNTARILY CONCLUDED BETWEEN THE WORKER AND THE TRANSFEROR OR THE TRANSFEREE OF THE UNDERTAKING . IN THAT SITUATION ARTICLE ( ) OF THE DIRECTIVE DOES NOT APPLY .  FOR THOSE REASONS IT MUST BE HELD IN REPLY TO THE FIRST QUESTION THAT ARTICLE ( ) OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 77/OF FEBRUARY MUST BE CONSTRUED AS NOT COVERING THE TRANSFER OF THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF PERSONS WHO WERE EMPLOYED BY THE TRANSFEROR AT THE DATE OF THE TRANSFER , BUT WHO , BY THEIR OWN DECISION , DO NOT CONTINUE TO WORK AS EMPLOYEES OF THE TRANSFEREE .  THE SECOND QUESTION  THE SECOND QUESTION CONCERNS THE MEANING OF THE TERM ' EMPLOYEE '  IN DIRECTIVE NO 77/.   BY THAT QUESTION THE VESTRE LANDSRET SEEKS TO ESTABLISH WHETHER OR NOT A PERSON WHO HOLDS A LARGE STAKE IN A COMPANY AND WHO IS ALSO THE CHAIRMAN OF ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY BE REGARDED AS ' AN EMPLOYEE '  OF THAT COMPANY WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE DIRECTIVE .  IN THAT REGARD THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS CLAIMS THAT THE TERM ' EMPLOYEE '  MEANS A PERSON WHO WORKS FOR AN EMPLOYER AND IS SUBJECT TO THE INSTRUCTIONS AND ORDERS OF THAT EMPLOYER . THAT DOES NOT APPLY TO A PERSON WHO CARRIES OUT WORK FOR A COMPANY IN WHICH HE HOLDS A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE SHARES .  THE DEFENDANT IN THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS , ON THE OTHER HAND , MAINTAINS THAT THE TERM ' EMPLOYEE '  WITHIN THE MEANING OF DIRECTIVE NO . 77/DOES EXTEND TO A PERSON WHO HOLDS SHARES IN , OR IS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF , THE COMPANY BY WHICH HE IS EMPLOYED , PROVIDED THAT HE DOES NOT OCCUPY A DOMINANT POSITION ON THAT BOARD .  THE COMMISSION OBSERVES IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH A COMMUNITY DEFINITION OF THE TERM ' EMPLOYEE '  WITHIN THE MEANING OF DIRECTIVE NO 77/. IT TAKES THE VIEW THAT THE TERM COVERS ANY PERSON WHO IN RETURN FOR REMUNERATION CARRIES OUT WORK ON BEHALF OF , AND AS THE SUBORDINATE PARTY IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH , ANOTHER PERSON . THAT DEFINITION DOES NOT MEAN THAT A PERSON CANNOT BE REGARDED AS AN EMPLOYEE WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE DIRECTIVE BECAUSE HE POSSESSES A CERTAIN , OR EVEN A SUBSTANTIAL , SHAREHOLDING IN THE UNDERTAKING . ON THE OTHER HAND , THE DIRECTIVE DOES NOT APPLY WHERE THE PERSON ' S POSITION IN THE UNDERTAKING IS SUCH THAT HE IS NO LONGER THE SUBORDINATE PARTY IN AN EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP .  IT IS COMMON GROUND THAT DIRECTIVE NO 77/DOES NOT CONTAIN AN EXPRESS DEFINITION OF THE TERM ' EMPLOYEE ' . IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH ITS MEANING IT IS NECESSARY TO APPLY GENERALLY RECOGNIZED PRINCIPLES OF INTERPRETATION BY REFERRING IN THE FIRST PLACE TO THE ORDINARY MEANING TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO THAT TERM IN ITS CONTEXT AND BY OBTAINING SUCH GUIDANCE AS MAY BE DERIVED FROM COMMUNITY TEXTS AND FROM CONCEPTS COMMON TO THE LEGAL SYSTEMS OF THE MEMBER STATES .  IT MAY BE RECALLED THAT THE COURT , INTER ALIA IN ITS JUDGMENT OF MARCH ( CASE 53/, LEVIN , ( ) ECR ), HELD THAT THE TERM ' WORKER '   AS USED IN THE TREATY , MAY NOT BE DEFINED BY REFERENCE TO THE NATIONAL LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES BUT HAS A COMMUNITY MEANING . IF THAT WERE NOT THE CASE , THE COMMUNITY RULES ON FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT FOR WORKERS WOULD BE FRUSTRATED , SINCE THE MEANING OF THE TERM COULD BE DECIDED UPON AND MODIFIED UNILATERALLY , WITHOUT ANY CONTROL BY THE COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS , BY THE MEMBER STATES , WHICH WOULD THUS BE ABLE TO EXCLUDE AT WILL CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF PERSONS FROM THE BENEFIT OF THE TREATY .  IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WHETHER SIMILAR CONSIDERATIONS APPLY TO THE DEFINITION OF THE TERM ' EMPLOYEE '  IN THE CONTEXT OF DIRECTIVE NO 77/. ACCORDING TO ITS PREAMBLE , THE DIRECTIVE IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT EMPLOYEES '  RIGHTS ARE SAFEGUARDED IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE OF EMPLOYER BY PROVIDING FOR , INTER ALIA , THE TRANSFER FROM THE TRANSFEROR TO THE TRANSFEREE OF THE EMPLOYEES '  RIGHTS ARISING FROM A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT OR FROM AN EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP ( ARTICLE ) AND BY PROTECTING EMPLOYEES AGAINST DISMISSALS MOTIVATED SOLELY BY THE FACT OF THE TRANSFER OF THE UNDERTAKING ( ARTICLE ).  IT IS CLEAR FROM THOSE PROVISIONS THAT DIRECTIVE NO 77/IS INTENDED TO ACHIEVE ONLY PARTIAL HARMONIZATION ESSENTIALLY BY EXTENDING THE PROTECTION GUARANTEED TO WORKERS INDEPENDENTLY BY THE LAWS OF THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATES TO COVER THE CASE WHERE AN UNDERTAKING IS TRANSFERRED . ITS AIM IS THEREFORE TO ENSURE , AS FAR AS POSSIBLE , THAT THE CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT OR THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP CONTINUES UNCHANGED WITH THE TRANSFEREE SO THAT THE EMPLOYEES AFFECTED BY THE TRANSFER OF THE UNDERTAKING ARE NOT PLACED IN A LESS FAVOURABLE POSITION SOLELY AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSFER . IT IS NOT HOWEVER INTENDED TO ESTABLISH A UNIFORM LEVEL OF PROTECTION THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY ON THE BASIS OF COMMON CRITERIA .  IT FOLLOWS THAT DIRECTIVE NO 77/MAY BE RELIED UPON ONLY BY PERSONS WHO ARE , IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER , PROTECTED AS EMPLOYEES UNDER THE LAW OF THE MEMBER STATE CONCERNED . IF THEY ARE SO PROTECTED , THE DIRECTIVE ENSURES THAT THEIR RIGHTS ARISING FROM A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT OR AN EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP ARE NOT DIMINISHED AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSFER .  IN REPLY TO THE SECOND QUESTION IT MUST THEREFORE BE HELD THAT THE TERM ' EMPLOYEE '  WITHIN THE MEANING OF DIRECTIVE NO 77/MUST BE INTERPRETED AS COVERING ANY PERSON WHO , IN THE MEMBER STATE CONCERNED , IS PROTECTED AS AN EMPLOYEE UNDER NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT LAW . IT IS FOR THE NATIONAL COURT TO ESTABLISH WHETHER THAT IS THE CASE IN THIS INSTANCE .

( 2)THE EXPRESSION ' EMPLOYEE '  WITHIN THE MEANING OF DIRECTIVE NO 77/MUST BE INTERPRETED AS COVERING ANY PERSON WHO , IN THE MEMBER STATE CONCERNED , IS PROTECTED AS AN EMPLOYEE UNDER NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT LAW .
