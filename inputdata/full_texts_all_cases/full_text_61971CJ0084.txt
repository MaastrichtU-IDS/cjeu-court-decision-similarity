THESE QUESTIONS WERE REFERRED IN CONNEXION WITH THE APPLICATION BY THE ITALIAN AUTHORITIES TO IMPORTS FROM OTHER MEMBER STATES AND THIRD COUNTRIES OF A DUTY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES AND A STATISTICS DUTY, WHICH WERE INTRODUCED BY ITALIAN LAW NO OF JUNE AND DECREES OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC NOS OF JUNE AND OF DECEMBER .  QUESTIONS 1, AND THE FIRST QUESTION INVITES THE COURT TO RULE WHETHER " THE CONCEPT OF A CHARGE HAVING EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO CUSTOMS DUTIES, REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE ( ) AND ( ) OF REGULATION NO 14/AND IN ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 805/IS THE SAME AS THAT DEFINED BY THE EEC TREATY, IN PARTICULAR IN ARTICLES 9, 12, AND THEREOF ".  THE SECOND AND FOURTH QUESTIONS ASK WHETHER THE DUTY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES AND THE STATISTICS DUTY INTRODUCED UNDER ITALIAN LEGISLATION CONSTITUTE SUCH CHARGES, WHICH ARE PROHIBITED UNDER THE REGULATIONS QUOTED .  IT FOLLOWS FROM THE JUDGMENTS OF THE COURT OF JULY IN CASE 24/(( ) ECR ET SEQ .) AND OF NOVEMBER IN CASE 8/(( ) ECR ET SEQ .) THAT THESE DUTIES CONSTITUTE CHARGES HAVING AN EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO A CUSTOMS DUTY WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLES 9, AND OF THE EEC TREATY AND OF CERTAIN REGULATIONS ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE AGRICULTURAL MARKET, ESPECIALLY ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 14/AND ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 805/. THE CONCEPT, IN THE PROVISIONS OF THE REGULATIONS QUOTED BY THE ITALIAN COURT, OF " CHARGE HAVING EQUIVALENT EFFECT " HAS THE SAME MEANING AS IN ARTICLE ET SEQ . OF THE TREATY AND IN THE OTHER REGULATIONS ON THE ORGANIZATION OF THE AGRICULTURAL MARKET .  QUESTIONS ( A ) AND ( B ), ( A ) AND ( B ), ( A ) AND ( B )  THE COURT IS FURTHER ASKED WHETHER THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ( ) AND ( ) OF REGULATION NO 14/AND OF ARTICLES ( ) AND ( ) OF REGULATION NO 805/LAY DOWN RULES WHICH ARE DIRECTLY APPLICABLE IN THE MEMBER STATES AND HAVE CREATED SUBJECTIVE RIGHTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF INDIVIDUALS WHICH THE NATIONAL COURTS MUST PROTECT .  UNDER THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY, A REGULATION " SHALL HAVE GENERAL APPLICATION " AND " SHALL BE ... DIRECTLY APPLICABLE IN ALL MEMBER STATES ". IN CONSEQUENCE, OWING TO ITS VERY NATURE AND ITS FUNCTION IN THE SYSTEM OF SOURCES OF COMMUNITY LAW, IT PRODUCES DIRECT EFFECTS AND, AS SUCH, IS CAPABLE OF CONFERRING RIGHTS ON INDIVIDUALS WHICH NATIONAL COURTS HAVE A DUTY TO PROTECT .  ACCORDINGLY THE EFFECT OF REGULATIONS SUCH AS THOSE PROVIDED FOR UNDER ARTICLE PRECLUDES THE APPLICATION OF ANY LEGISLATIVE MEASURE, EVEN A SUBSEQUENT ONE, WHICH IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THEIR PROVISIONS . THIS APPLIES TO THE PROVISIONS QUOTED .  QUESTIONS ( C ), ( C ), ( C ) AND FINALLY, THE COURT IS ASKED TO STATE THE DATES ON WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER ARTICLE ( ) AND ( ) OF REGULATION NO 14/AND UNDER ARTICLES ( ) AND ( ) OF REGULATION NO 805/AROSE . THE COURT IS FURTHER REQUESTED TO DECLARE WHETHER THESE RIGHTS HAVE EXISTED CONTINUOUSLY FROM THE TIME WHEN THEY AROSE UNDER THE SYSTEM LAID DOWN IN REGULATION NO 14/. IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO CONSIDER FROM WHAT DATES THE SAID PROVISIONS TOOK EFFECT AND WHETHER THEY HAVE CONTINUED TO EXIST SINCE THEN .  ( ) UNDER ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 14/64, THE DATE OF INTRODUCTION OF THE SYSTEM OF TRADE INSTITUTED BY THE REGULATION WAS FIXED AT JULY . UNDER ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) OF REGULATION NO 82/THE DATE JULY WAS SUBSTITUTED THEREFOR AND, PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPHS ( ) AND ( ) OF THE SAME PROVISION, WAS IN TURN REPLACED BY NOVEMBER . THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THESE PROVISIONS IS THAT THE DATE JULY 1964, WHICH APPEARS IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 14/64, HAS BEEN REPLACED BY NOVEMBER . ACCORDINGLY, THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ( ) AND ( ) OF REGULATION NO 14/TOOK EFFECT ON NOVEMBER .  ( ) THE THIRD PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE BASIC REGULATION, ( EEC ) NO 805/68, REPEALED REGULATION NO 14/WITH EFFECT FROM JULY . THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE PROVIDES THAT, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN MEASURES OF NO RELEVANCE TO THE PRESENT CASE, " THE SYSTEM ESTABLISHED BY THIS REGULATION SHALL APPLY FROM " THAT DATE . ACCORDINGLY, AS FAR AS THE SYSTEM ESTABLISHED BY REGULATION NO 805/IS CONCERNED, THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES ( ) AND ( ) OF THAT REGULATION TOOK EFFECT ON JULY . REGULATION NO 805/IS STILL IN FORCE .  ( ) IT FOLLOWS FROM THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS THAT THE EFFECTS IN QUESTION HAVE EXISTED CONTINUOUSLY SINCE NOVEMBER .
