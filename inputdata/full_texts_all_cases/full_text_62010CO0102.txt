                  possible for the national court to rule that the clause excluding the risk insured is null and void.
               
Operative part:
1.
	The compulsory civil liability insurance system in respect of the use of motor vehicles established by
–        Council Directive 72/166/EEC of April on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to insurance
         against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles and to the enforcement of the obligation to insure against
         such liability,
      
–        Second Council Directive 84/5/EEC of December on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to insurance
         against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles,
      
–        Third Council Directive 90/232/EEC of May on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to insurance
         against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles,
      
–        Directive 2000/26/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of May on the approximation of the laws of the
         Member States relating to insurance against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles (Fourth Motor Insurance
         Directive), and
      
–        Directive 2005/14/EEC of the European Parliament and of the Council of May amending Council Directives 72/166/EEC,
         84/5/EEC, 88/357/EEC and 90/232/EEC and Directive 2000/26/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to insurance
         against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles,
      
does not preclude national legislation that provides that the insurer excludes from the cover of the contract of optional
         insurance of a motor vehicle damage caused when that vehicle is driven by a person under the influence of alcohol.
      
2.
	The compulsory insurance against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles established by the Directives 72/166,
                     84/5, 90/232, 2000/and 2005/does not preclude national legislation that does not oblige an insurer to compensate immediately,
                     under a contract of optional insurance of a motor vehicle, the person insured who suffered harm following an accident and
                     to secure repayment of the amount of the compensation paid to that insured person from the person responsible for the accident,
                     in circumstances in which the insurance does not cover the risk because of an exclusion clause.
                  
3.
	National legislation providing for the insurer to exclude from the cover of an optional motor vehicle insurance contract the
                     damage caused when that vehicle is driven by a person under the influence of alcohol constitutes a restriction both of freedom
                     of establishment and of freedom to provide services.  It is for the national court to consider to what extent that restriction
                     may, nevertheless, be permissible under the exceptions expressly provided for by the Treaty on European Union or justified,
                     in accordance with the case-law of the Court, by overriding reasons relating to the public interest.
