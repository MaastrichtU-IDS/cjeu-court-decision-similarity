Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE SUSPENSION , AS AN INTERIM MEASURE , OF THE OPERATION OF THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION TO ENGAGE B . MATH AS A TEMPORARY MEMBER OF STAFF FOR A FIXED PERIOD , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON NOVEMBER , ERIK VAN DER STIJL , AN OFFICIAL OF THE COMMISSION IN GRADE A , BROUGHT AN ACTION ASKING PRIMARILY FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION TO ENGAGE B . MATH TO SERVE AS HEAD OF THE INSPECTION DIVISION OF THE EURATOM SAFEGUARDS DIRECTORATE IN THE DIRECTORATE-GENERAL FOR ENERGY .  BY AN APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES LODGED ON THE SAME DAY , THE APPLICANT SEEKS THE SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF THAT DECISION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  BY A DECISION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION DATED NOVEMBER MR MATH WAS APPOINTED HEAD OF DIVISION ( DIRECTORATE-GENERAL FOR ENERGY , EURATOM SAFEGUARDS DIRECTORATE , INSPECTION DIVISION ) WITH RETROACTIVE EFFECT TO SEPTEMBER . BY A JUDGMENT GIVEN ON OCTOBER ( CASE 128/VAN DER STIJL V COMMISSION ( ) ECR ), THE COURT ANNULLED THAT DECISION ON THE GROUND THAT THE PROCEDURE FOLLOWED IN ORDER TO FILL THE POST IN QUESTION WAS VITIATED BY AN INFRINGEMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS .  ON OCTOBER , THE COMMISSION DECIDED ( A ) TO ENGAGE MR MATH TO SERVE AS HEAD OF THE INSPECTION DIVISION OF THE DIRECTORATE-GENERAL FOR ENERGY AS A TEMPORARY MEMBER OF STAFF IN GRADE A FOR A TWO-YEAR PERIOD STARTING ON SEPTEMBER AND EXTENDED TO DECEMBER , AND ( B ) TO RESUME WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS ITS DELIBERATIONS ON THE PROCEDURE COMMENCED IN ORDER TO FILL THE POST IN QUESTION .  IN HIS APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES , THE APPLICANT ASKS , IN SUBSTANCE , PRIMARILY FOR AN ORDER REQUIRING THE COMMISSION TO SUSPEND THE OPERATION OF ITS DECISION OF OCTOBER UNTIL THE COURT HAS GIVEN JUDGMENT IN THE MAIN ACTION . IN THE ALTERNATIVE , HE ASKS THAT THE COMMISSION BE ENJOINED FROM TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FOR THE PURPOSES OF A PERMANENT APPOINTMENT TO THE POST OF HEAD OF THE INSPECTION DIVISION THE PERIODS SERVED BY MR MATH AS A TEMPORARY MEMBER OF STAFF BETWEEN SEPTEMBER AND DECEMBER AND ORDERING THE COMMISSION TO ADOPT A DECISION ON THE APPLICANT ' S COMPLAINT AGAINST THE CONTESTED DECISION . IN THE FURTHER ALTERNATIVE , HE ASKS THE COURT TO PRESCRIBE ANY OTHER MEASURES WHICH IT CONSIDERS APPROPRIATE .  BY WAY OF ESTABLISHING THAT THE SUSPENSION OF OPERATION OF THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION IS A MATTER OF URGENCY , THE APPLICANT STATES THAT HE LODGED A COMPLAINT AGAINST THE CONTESTED DECISION ON NOVEMBER . THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY MUST ADOPT A REASONED DECISION AT THE LATEST ON MARCH . EVEN IF THE APPLICANT BRINGS AN ACTION AGAINST A POSSIBLE REJECTION OF HIS COMPLAINT IMMEDIATELY , THERE IS NO PROSPECT OF THE COURT ' S GIVING JUDGMENT ON THE LEGALITY OF THE CONTESTED DECISION BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF AT THE EARLIEST BECAUSE OF THE TIME TAKEN BY THE COURT PROCEDURE . IN THE MEANTIME THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY MAY HAVE ADOPTED DECISIONS MAKING A DEFINITIVE APPOINTMENT TO THE VACANT POST , AND MR MATH MAY HAVE RELIED ON HIS UNLAWFULLY ACQUIRED STATUS AS A TEMPORARY MEMBER OF STAFF , AND THE SENIORITY HE WILL HAVE IMPROPERLY ACQUIRED , IN ORDER TO SUCCEED IN THE RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES OPENED FOR THAT PURPOSE . THAT WILL MEAN THAT FURTHER DECISIONS WILL HAVE BEEN ADOPTED WHOSE ILLEGALITY FLOWS FROM THE ILLEGALITY OF THE CONTESTED DECISION , THUS COMPELLING THE APPLICANT ONCE AGAIN TO INITIATE THE COMPLAINTS PROCEDURES AND PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COURT SUBJECT TO THE TIME-LIMITS LAID DOWN IN ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  THE COMMISSION STATES THAT ITS DECISION OF OCTOBER IS THE FIRST STEP TAKEN IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED JUDGMENT BUT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT JUDGMENT . THE DECISION IS ALSO INTENDED TO REGULARIZE MR MATH ' S PERSONAL ADMINISTRATIVE STATUS AND TO ENSURE CONTINUITY WITHIN THE SERVICE .  THE COMMISSION FURTHER DENIES THE URGENCY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS FOR INTERIM MEASURES . IT STATES THAT THERE IS NO RISK OF IRREPARABLE DAMAGE TO THE APPLICANT . AT ANY STAGE IN THE NEW PROCEDURE FOR FILLING THE POST AT ISSUE AND IN THE COURSE OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CONCERNING THAT PROCEDURE , THE APPLICANT WILL BE ABLE TO PUT FORWARD AGAINST THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY HIS CONTENTION THAT IT IS NOT ENTITLED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT MR MATH ' S SERVICE AS A TEMPORARY MEMBER OF STAFF .  THE PARTIES HAVE SET OUT THEIR POSITIONS AT LENGTH IN THE PLEADINGS AND SUBMITTED ALL THE DOCUMENTS TO WHICH IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE REGARD IN DECIDING ON THE APPLICATION FOR INTERIM MEASURES AND THE COURT HAS NOT FOUND IT NECESSARY TO ORDER A PREPARATORY INQUIRY OR HEAR ORAL ARGUMENT FROM THE PARTIES .  UNDER THE TERMS OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE , IT IS FOR THE APPLICANT TO ESTABLISH BOTH THE CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO URGENCY AND THE FACTUAL AND LEGAL GROUNDS MAKING OUT A PRIMA FACIE CASE FOR THE INTERIM MEASURES APPLIED FOR .  IN THIS INSTANCE IT IS SUFFICIENT TO POINT OUT , WITHOUT ITS BEING NECESSARY TO DISCUSS THE SECOND CONDITION LAID DOWN BY THAT PROVISION , THAT THE APPLICANT HAS NOT PUT FORWARD ANY GROUNDS CAPABLE OF ESTABLISHING THE URGENCY OF THE MEASURES SOUGHT .  IT APPEARS FROM THE INFORMATION RECEIVED BY THE COURT AT THIS STAGE THAT THE PROCEDURE FOR FILLING THE POST OF THE HEAD OF THE INSPECTION DIVISION OF THE EURATOM SAFEGUARDS DIRECTORATE IN THE DIRECTORATE-GENERAL FOR ENERGY HAS NOT YET BEEN COMPLETED . THE DECISION IN QUESTION IS MERELY A TRANSITIONAL MEASURE UNTIL DECEMBER WHICH WAS ADOPTED IN ORDER TO ENSURE CONTINUITY IN THE SERVICE . THE APPLICANT WILL BE IN A POSITION TO STATE HIS CASE WITH REGARD TO THE ALLEGED ILLEGALITY OF THE DECISION OF OCTOBER AT ANY STAGE IN THE COURSE OF THE CURRENT PROCEDURE FOR DEFINITIVELY FILLING THE POST . FURTHERMORE , SINCE THE ALLEGED ILLEGALITY OF THE DECISION IS ALSO THE BASIS OF HIS ACTION FOR ANNULMENT , THE APPLICANT WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE PLACED IN THE POSITION EXISTING PRIOR TO THE CONTESTED DECISION IF HE SUCCEEDS IN THAT ACTION . THAT BEING THE CASE , IT MUST BE HELD THAT THE APPLICANT HAS NOT SUCCEEDED IN ESTABLISHING THAT THE DECISION OF OCTOBER CAUSES HIM IRREPARABLE DAMAGE JUSTIFYING THE GRANT OF INTERIM MEASURES BY THE COURT .  SINCE URGENCY IS ALSO NOT MADE OUT AS REGARDS THE ORDERS SOUGHT IN THE ALTERNATIVE , THE APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES MUST BE DISMISSED IN ITS ENTIRETY .
