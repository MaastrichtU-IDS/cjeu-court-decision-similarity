Summary
. THE EXTENT TO WHICH EXTERNAL TRADE IS TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN RELATION TO MEASURES ADOPTED UNDER ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY IS A MATTER FOR THE COMMISSION TO DECIDE , AND IN ARRIVING AT THAT DECISION IT MUST TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE COMMUNITY STEEL INDUSTRY ' S OWN NEEDS AND THE COMMUNITY ' S INTERESTS IN ITS RELATIONS WITH NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES . THEREFORE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO INFER FROM ARTICLE ANY OBLIGATION ON THE COMMISSION TO EXEMPT FROM THE QUOTA SYSTEM THE PRODUCTION WHICH CERTAIN UNDERTAKINGS MIGHT PREFER TO DIRECT TOWARDS EXPORT MARKETS .  . ALTHOUGH THE GENERAL DECISION , DECISION NO 2794/, PROVIDED FOR PRODUCTION QUOTAS FOR THE STEEL INDUSTRY FROM OCTOBER WHEREAS IT ONLY CAME INTO FORCE ON OCTOBER , IT DID NOT HAVE GENUINE RETROACTIVE EFFECT SINCE THE UNDERTAKINGS AFFECTED WERE ABLE TO ADJUST THEIR PRODUCTION IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THEIR QUOTAS FOR THE QUARTER AND THEREBY AVOID ANY INFRINGEMENT .  . ALTHOUGH IN GENERAL THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY PRECLUDES A COMMUNITY MEASURE FROM TAKING EFFECT FROM A POINT IN TIME BEFORE ITS PUBLICATION , IT MAY EXCEPTIONALLY BE OTHERWISE WHERE THE PURPOSE TO BE ACHIEVED SO DEMANDS AND WHERE THE LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS OF THOSE CONCERNED ARE DULY RESPECTED .   . THE GOAL OF THE STEEL PRODUCTION QUOTA SYSTEM INTRODUCED UNDER ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY IS TO IMPROVE MARKET CONDITIONS SO AS TO ENABLE THE PROFITABILITY OF UNDERTAKINGS TO BE MAINTAINED OR RESTORED IN THE LONG TERM AND THEREBY ENABLE THE JOBS WHICH DEPEND ON IT TO BE PRESERVED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE . HOWEVER , ARTICLE DOES NOT IN ANY WAY REQUIRE THE COMMISSION TO GUARANTEE EACH INDIVIDUAL UNDERTAKING A MINIMUM LEVEL OF PRODUCTION DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE UNDERTAKING ' S OWN CRITERIA OF PROFITABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT . THE AIM OF THAT ARTICLE IS TO SPREAD IN THE MOST EQUITABLE MANNER POSSIBLE AMONGST ALL UNDERTAKINGS THE REDUCTIONS REQUIRED BY THE ECONOMIC SITUATION , NOT TO GUARANTEE UNDERTAKINGS A MINIMUM LEVEL OF EMPLOYMENT PROPORTIONATE TO THEIR CAPACITY .  . THE GENERAL AIMS SET OUT IN ARTICLES , AND OF THE ECSC TREATY MUST CONSTANTLY BE RECONCILED WITH ONE ANOTHER IN THE LIGHT OF THE ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEREFORE PRIORITY MAY NOT BE GIVEN TO ONE OF THOSE AIMS TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE OTHERS .  . THE PRODUCTION QUOTA SYSTEM ESTABLISHED BY DECISION NO 2794/WOULD BE GRAVELY COMPROMISED OR EVEN DESTROYED IF EVERY UNDERTAKING WERE ABLE , BY PLEADING EMERGENCY DUE TO SERIOUS ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES , TO EXCUSE ITSELF FROM OBSERVANCE OF THE RESTRICTIONS AND TO EXCEED AT WILL THE PRODUCTION QUOTA ALLOCATED TO IT . THE CHAIN REACTION THEREBY RELEASED WOULD CULMINATE IN THE COLLAPSE OF THE SYSTEM , SO THAT ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY WOULD BECOME A DEAD LETTER .

Subject of the case
APPLICATION REQUESTING THE COURT TO DECLARE VOID THE DECISION OF AUGUST BY WHICH THE COMMISSION , PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF COMMISSION DECISION NO 2794/80/ECSC OF OCTOBER , IMPOSED A FINE OF EUROPEAN CURRENCY UNITS ON THE APPLICANT FOR EXCEEDING BY TONNES THE PRODUCTION QUOTA ALLOCATED TO IT FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF IN RESPECT OF PRODUCTS FALLING WITHIN CATEGORY IV ( LIGHT SECTIONS ), 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON SEPTEMBER FERRIERE SAN CARLO SPA BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY CHALLENGING THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION OF AUGUST IMPOSING A FINE ON IT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY AND COMMISSION DECISION NO 2794/80/ECSC OF OCTOBER ESTABLISHING A SYSTEM OF STEEL PRODUCTION QUOTAS FOR UNDERTAKINGS IN THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ).   THE CONTESTED DECISION STATES THAT IN BREACH OF THE AFOREMENTIONED DECISION NO 2794/THE APPLICANT EXCEEDED BY TONNES THE PRODUCTION QUOTA OF TONNES WHICH THE COMMISSION HAD ALLOCATED TO IT FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF IN RESPECT OF PRODUCTS FALLING WITHIN CATEGORY IV . IT DECLARES THAT THE APPLICANT ' S PRODUCTION THEREFORE EXCEEDED THE QUOTA ALLOCATED TO IT BY MORE THAN 10% AND , PURSUANT TO THE FIRST AND SECOND PARAGRAPHS OF ARTICLE OF THE SAID DECISION , IT IMPOSES ON THE UNDERTAKING A FINE OF BY  82.ECU , THAT IS TO SAY A TOTAL OF ECU .        BY THIS ACTION THE APPLICANT SEEKS PRIMARILY TO HAVE THE CONTESTED DECISION FIXING THE FINE DECLARED VOID OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE TO HAVE THE FINE REDUCED , AND FINALLY REQUESTS THE COURT TO GRANT ' ' TERMS AND PAYMENT PERIODS ' '  WHICH TAKE ACCOUNT OF BOTH ITS FINANCIAL POSITION AND THE CURRENT SITUATION OF THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY .  THE CLAIM THAT THE CONTESTED DECISION SHOULD BE DECLARED VOID   IN SUPPORT OF ITS CLAIM THAT THE DECISION SHOULD BE DECLARED VOID THE APPLICANT RELIES ON THE FOLLOWING SUBMISSIONS : THE CONTESTED DECISION TOOK NO ACCOUNT OF THE FACT THAT THE QUOTA IN QUESTION WAS EXCEEDED SOLELY BECAUSE OF AN ORDER EXPORTED TO A NON-MEMBER COUNTRY ; THE GENERAL DECISION ON WHICH THE CONTESTED DECISION IS BASED , DECISION NO 2794/, HAS UNLAWFUL RETROACTIVE EFFECT ; THE CONTESTED DECISION INFRINGES ARTICLES AND OF THE ECSC TREATY ; IT ALSO INFRINGES ARTICLE OF DECISION NO 2794/AND ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY ; THE QUOTA ALLOCATED TO THE APPLICANT WAS NOT ADJUSTED DESPITE THE FACT THAT ITS PRODUCTION POTENTIAL HAD INCREASED ; THE CONTESTED DECISION TOOK NO ACCOUNT OF THE APPLICANT ' S CONDUCT AFTER OCTOBER .   THE FIRST SUBMISSION IN THE APPLICATION   THE APPLICANT CONTENDS THAT ITS ALLEGED SURPASSING OF ITS QUOTA WAS DUE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE EXPORTATION OF TWO CONSIGNMENTS OF TONNES EACH TO LIBYA ON NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER . IT ARGUES THEREFORE THAT THE COMMISSION SHOULD NOT PENALIZE AN UNDERTAKING FOR EXPORTING TO A NON-MEMBER COUNTRY , PARTICULARLY WHEN IN DOING SO THE APPLICANT HAS COMPLIED WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE TREATY AS EXPRESSED IN ARTICLES AND AND HAS , MOREOVER , CAUSED NO INJURY TO ITS COMPETITORS ESTABLISHED IN THE MEMBER STATES .   AS THE COURT HAS ALREADY EMPHASIZED IN OTHER JUDGMENTS THE EXTENT TO WHICH EXTERNAL TRADE IS TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN RELATION TO MEASURES ADOPTED UNDER ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY IS A MATTER FOR THE COMMISSION TO DECIDE , AND IN ARRIVING AT THAT DECISION IT MUST TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE COMMUNITY STEEL INDUSTRY ' S OWN NEEDS AND THE COMMUNITY ' S INTERESTS IN ITS RELATIONS WITH NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES . THEREFORE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO INFER FROM ARTICLE ANY OBLIGATION ON THE COMMISSION TO EXEMPT FROM THE     QUOTA SYSTEM THE PRODUCTION WHICH CERTAIN UNDERTAKINGS MIGHT PREFER TO DIRECT TOWARDS EXPORT MARKETS . THE SUBMISSION MUST THEREFORE BE REJECTED .   FURTHERMORE , AS THE COMMISSION RIGHTLY STATED THE PENALTY FOR EXCEEDING THE QUOTA WAS IMPOSED NOT IN RESPECT OF THE EXPORTS TO A NON-MEMBER COUNTRY BUT IN RESPECT OF THE TOTAL PRODUCTION DURING THE QUARTER IN QUESTION . MOREOVER , IT IS CLEAR FROM THE EVIDENCE THAT IN DECEMBER ALONE , THAT IS TO SAY AFTER THE ORDER INTENDED FOR EXPORT TO A NON-MEMBER COUNTRY HAD BEEN COMPLETED , THE APPLICANT MANUFACTURED TONNES OF STEEL PRODUCTS , WHICH IS GREATER THAN THE EXCESS PRODUCTION WITH WHICH IT IS CHARGED .  THE SECOND SUBMISSION IN THE APPLICATION   THE APPLICANT MAINTAINS THAT THE RETROACTIVE EFFECT OF THE CONTESTED DECISION IS UNLAWFUL FOR TWO REASONS : IN THE FIRST PLACE , THE FIRST ORDER OF TONNES , DESPATCHED TO A NON-MEMBER COUNTRY ON NOVEMBER , WAS IN RESPECT OF A CONTRACT MADE ON OCTOBER , THAT IS TO SAY BEFORE DECISION NO 2794/, WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL ON OCTOBER , CAME INTO FORCE ; IN THE SECOND PLACE , IT WAS WRONG TO RELY ON PRODUCTION IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS OF IN ORDER TO DETERMINE ANY EXCESS BECAUSE PRODUCTION IN OCTOBER AND ORDERS ACCEPTED BEFORE OCTOBER ARE NOT NORMALLY TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT . CONSEQUENTLY , THE APPLICANT MAINTAINS THAT THE COMMISSION SHOULD , AT THE VERY LEAST , WITHDRAW ITS OBJECTIONS IN RESPECT OF HALF OF THE ALLEGED EXCESS PRODUCTION .   THE REPLY TO BE GIVEN TO THAT SUBMISSION , AS THE COURT HAS HELD ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS ( JUDGMENT OF . . IN CASE 258/SPA METALLURGICA RUMI V COMMISSION ( ) ECR ; JUDGMENT OF . . IN CASE 276/FERRIERA PADANA SPA V COMMISSION ( ) ECR ), IS THAT DECISION NO 2794/80/ECSC DID NOT HAVE GENUINE RETROACTIVE EFFECT SINCE THE UNDERTAKINGS WERE ABLE TO ADJUST THEIR PRODUCTION IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THEIR QUOTAS FOR THE QUARTER AND THEREBY AVOID ANY INFRINGEMENT . MOREOVER , ALTHOUGH IN GENERAL THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY PRECLUDES A COMMUNITY MEASURE FROM TAKING EFFECT FROM A POINT IN TIME BEFORE ITS PUBLICATION , IT MAY EXCEPTIONALLY BE OTHERWISE WHERE THE PURPOSE TO BE ACHIEVED SO DEMANDS AND WHERE THE LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS OF THOSE CONCERNED ARE DULY RESPECTED .       IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS CASE IT WAS NECESSARY TO INCLUDE THE MONTH OF OCTOBER IN THE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO PREVENT UNDERTAKINGS FROM INCREASING THEIR PRODUCTION IN OCTOBER IN ANTICIPATION OF THE REDUCTIONS SUBSEQUENTLY TO BE APPLIED .   FURTHERMORE , THE COMMISSION RESPECTED THE LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS OF THOSE CONCERNED BY MEANS OF THE COMMUNICATION OF OCTOBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , C , P . ) WHEREBY IT GAVE NOTICE OF ITS INTENTION TO INCLUDE THE MONTH OF OCTOBER IN THE SYSTEM OF QUOTAS , AND BY MEANS OF THE DECISION PUBLISHED ON THE SAME DATE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) REQUIRING THE UNDERTAKINGS TO SUPPLY INFORMATION ON THEIR PRODUCTION FOR OCTOBER .    MOREOVER , THE DOCUMENTS PRODUCED BY THE COMMISSION SHOW THAT IT HELD TWO MEETINGS WITH INDEPENDENT ITALIAN PRODUCERS ON AND OCTOBER IN ORDER TO INFORM THEM OF THE INTRODUCTION OF A QUOTA SYSTEM FOR STEEL PRODUCTS .   THUS EVEN IF THE COMMISSION DID NOT INDICATE PRECISELY WHAT THE LEVEL OF QUOTAS WOULD BE , WHICH MIGHT HAVE PREVENTED THE UNDERTAKINGS FROM DETERMINING THE PRECISE CONSEQUENCES OF THE COMMISSION ' S ADVICE AND ENSURING THAT THEIR PRODUCTION WAS NOT EXCESSIVE IN RELATION TO THE QUOTAS WHICH WERE TO BE ALLOCATED TO THEM FOR THE WHOLE QUARTER , THE FACT IS THAT THE UNDERTAKINGS DID RECEIVE NOTICE OF THE COMMISSION ' S INTENTIONS .   IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING THE SECOND SUBMISSION IN SUPPORT OF THE APPLICATION MUST BE REJECTED .  THE THIRD SUBMISSION IN THE APPLICATION   FERRIERE SAN CARLO IS OF THE OPINION THAT IT CAUSED NO INJURY TO COMPETING UNDERTAKINGS ESTABLISHED IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY BECAUSE IT DELIVERED THE EXCESS PRODUCTION OUTSIDE THE COMMUNITY . IT ARGUES THAT THEREFORE , SINCE THE CONTESTED DECISION DID NOT TAKE ACCOUNT OF THAT FACT , IT INFRINGED THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES AND OF THE ECSC TREATY , IN PARTICULAR THOSE WHICH REQUIRE THE COMMISSION TO ENABLE UNDERTAKINGS TO SECURE A MINIMUM LEVEL OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES , TO MAINTAIN THE LEVEL OF EMPLOYMENT     AND A SUFFICIENT PRODUCTION CAPACITY AND TO PROMOTE THE ORDERLY EXPANSION AND MODERNIZATION OF PRODUCTION .   THE SUBMISSION AMOUNTS TO A PRELIMINARY OBJECTION WHICH CHALLENGES IN EFFECT ONCE MORE THE LEGALITY OF THE GENERAL DECISION , DECISION NO 2794/.    AS THE COURT HAS ALREADY HELD IN RESPONSE TO COMPARABLE ARGUMENTS ( JUDGMENT OF . . IN FERRIERA PADANA SPA , CITED ABOVE , AND JUDGMENT OF . . IN CASE 119/, KLOCKNER V COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ( ) ECR ), THE APPLICANT ' S ARGUMENT FAILS TO APPRECIATE THE TRUE PURPOSE OF ARTICLE WITHIN THE SYSTEM OF THE TREATY AS A WHOLE . THE PROVISION IS INTENDED TO ENABLE THE COMMUNITY TO DEAL WITH A CRISIS CAUSED BY A DECLINE IN DEMAND . IT PROVIDES FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF A SYSTEM OF PRODUCTION QUOTAS WHICH IS INTENDED TO SPREAD EQUITABLY THROUGHOUT THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY OF THE COMMUNITY THE UNAVOIDABLE CONSEQUENCES OF THE ADJUSTMENT OF PRODUCTION TO THE REDUCED NUMBER OF POSSIBILITIES OF DISPOSAL .   THE GOAL OF THOSE RESTRICTIVE MEASURES IS TO IMPROVE MARKET CONDITIONS SO AS TO ENABLE THE PROFITABILITY OF UNDERTAKINGS TO BE MAINTAINED OR RESTORED IN THE LONG TERM AND THEREBY ENABLE THE JOBS WHICH DEPEND ON IT TO BE PRESERVED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE . HOWEVER , CONTRARY TO THE APPLICANT ' S CONTENTIONS , ARTICLE DOES NOT IN ANY WAY REQUIRE THE COMMISSION TO GUARANTEE EACH INDIVIDUAL UNDERTAKING A MINIMUM LEVEL OF PRODUCTION DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE UNDERTAKINGS ' S OWN CRITERIA OF PROFITABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT . THE AIM OF THAT ARTICLE IS TO SPREAD IN THE MOST EQUITABLE MANNER POSSIBLE AMONGST ALL UNDERTAKINGS THE REDUCTIONS REQUIRED BY THE ECONOMIC SITUATION , NOT TO GUARANTEE UNDERTAKINGS A MINIMUM LEVEL OF EMPLOYMENT PROPORTIONATE TO THEIR CAPACITY .   AS REGARDS IN PARTICULAR THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES , AND , MENTIONED IN PARAGRAPH ( ) OF ARTICLE AND RELIED UPON BY THE APPLICANT , IT SHOULD BE OBSERVED THAT THE GENERAL AIMS SET OUT IN THOSE ARTICLES MUST CONSTANTLY BE RECONCILED WITH ONE ANOTHER IN THE LIGHT OF THE ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEREFORE PRIORITY MAY NOT BE GIVEN TO ONE OF THOSE AIMS TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE OTHERS . AS FAR AS THE REFERENCE IN ARTICLE ( ) TO THE NEED ' ' TO MAINTAIN EMPLOYMENT ' '  IS CONCERNED , IT IS MADE IN RELATION TO A REGULATORY MECHANISM     TO WHICH THE COMMISSION HAS NOT RESORTED . IT SHOULD BE ADDED THAT IN ESTABLISHING THE QUOTA SYSTEM THE COMMISSION DID NOT DISREGARD THE NEED TO MAINTAIN EMPLOYMENT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT TOOK ACCOUNT , IN ARTICLE ( ) OF DECISION NO 2794/, OF THE LEVEL OF UTILIZATION OF CAPACITY .   THE SUBMISSION MUST THEREFORE BE REJECTED .  THE FOURTH SUBMISSION IN THE APPLICATION   THE APPLICANT MAINTAINS THAT THE CONTESTED DECISION INFRINGES ARTICLE OF DECISION NO 2794/AND ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY .   THE COURT FINDS THAT THE APPLICANT HAS NOT ADDUCED ANY EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF ITS SUBMISSIONS WHICH WOULD ENABLE THE COURT TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS WELL FOUNDED . IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE SUBMISSION MUST BE REJECTED .  THE FIFTH SUBMISSION IN THE APPLICATION   THE APPLICANT MAINTAINS THAT THE QUOTA ALLOCATED TO IT FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF WAS NOT ADJUSTED DESPITE THE FACT THAT ITS PRODUCTION POTENTIAL HAD INCREASED DUE TO THE ACTIVATION OF A NEW ROLLING-MILL . IT IS THEREFORE OF THE OPINION THAT THE CONTESTED DECISION INFRINGES ARTICLE OF DECISION NO 2794/, ARTICLES AND OF COMMISSION DECISION NO 1831/81/ECSC OF JUNE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) AND ARTICLES AND OF COMMISSION DECISION NO 1696/82/ECSC OF JUNE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ).   THE COURT NOTES FIRST THAT THE ONLY PROVISIONS WHICH THE APPLICANT MAY USEFULLY RELY UPON , IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE ALLEGED EXCESS PRODUCTION TOOK PLACE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF , ARE THOSE CONTAINED IN ARTICLE ( ) OF DECISION NO 2794/, WHICH STATES AS FOLLOWS :    ' ' WHERE , FURTHER TO AN INVESTMENT PROGRAMME DULY REPORTED AND NOT THE SUBJECT OF AN UNFAVOURABLE OPINION , THE UNDERTAKING ACTIVATES A NEW PLANT AFTER JULY , THE COMMISSION SHALL ADAPT APPROPRIATELY THE REFERENCE PRODUCTION OF THIS UNDERTAKING , PROVIDED IT FINDS THAT THE NEW PRODUCTION     POSSIBILITY THUS ESTABLISHED BRINGS THE TOTAL PRODUCTION POSSIBILITIES FOR THE FOUR GROUPS OF PRODUCTS TO A LEVEL EXCEEDING BY AT LEAST % THE TOTAL PRODUCTION POSSIBILITIES EXISTING FOR . ' '   THE COURT NOTES SECONDLY THAT IT IS CLEAR FROM THE EVIDENCE AND IN PARTICULAR FROM THE REPLIES GIVEN BY THE COMMISSION TO THE QUESTIONS ASKED BY THE COURT , WHICH WERE NOT CONTRADICTED BY THE APPLICANT , THAT ALTHOUGH THE LATTER REQUESTED THE COMMISSION SEVERAL TIMES TO VERIFY THE IMPROVEMENT IN ITS PLANT IT WAS ONLY ON OCTOBER , AS A RESULT OF A FURTHER INSPECTION CARRIED OUT BY COMMISSION STAFF , THAT IT COULD BE ESTABLISHED THAT CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS HAD BEEN MADE TO THE PLANT BETWEEN AUGUST AND FEBRUARY AND THAT AS A RESULT THE APPLICANT ' S PRODUCTION CAPACITY HAD MORE THAN DOUBLED . IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE COMMISSION , BY A DECISION NOTIFIED TO THE UNDERTAKING ON NOVEMBER , ADJUSTED THE UNDERTAKING ' S PRODUCTION QUOTAS WITH EFFECT FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF DECISION NO 1831/.    IT FOLLOWS THAT THE APPLICANT IS IN NO RESPECT ENTITLED TO REQUEST AN ADJUSTMENT OF THE PRODUCTION QUOTA ALLOCATED TO IT FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF , THE ONLY ONE AT ISSUE IN THIS CASE , AND THAT THE AFOREMENTIONED SUBMISSION MUST BE REJECTED .  THE SIXTH SUBMISSION IN THE APPLICATION   FINALLY , THE APPLICANT MAINTAINS THAT THE CONTESTED DECISION IS UNLAWFUL BECAUSE IT DID NOT TAKE ACCOUNT OF ITS CONDUCT AFTER OCTOBER AND IN PARTICULAR OF THE FACT THAT FERRIERE SAN CARLO CLOSED ITS WORKS DURING NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER IN ORDER NOT TO EXCEED THE PRODUCTION QUOTAS ALLOCATED TO IT .   THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT THIS SUBMISSION MUST BE REJECTED BECAUSE IN THE FIRST PLACE EVEN IF IT WERE PROVEN , THE FACT RELIED UPON BY FERRIERE SAN CARLO IS WHOLLY IRRELEVANT TO THE QUESTION OF THE LEGALITY OF THE CONTESTED DECISION , AND IN THE SECOND PLACE IT APPEARS FROM THE EVIDENCE THAT ITS STATEMENT IS IN     FACT INCORRECT : DURING THE QUARTER IN QUESTION THE APPLICANT PRODUCED TONNES IN OCTOBER , TONNES IN NOVEMBER AND TONNES IN DECEMBER . IT IS THEREFORE NOT REASONABLY POSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN THAT THE APPLICANT CEASED OPERATIONS DURING NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER .    IT FOLLOWS FROM THE WHOLE OF THE FOREGOING THAT THE CLAIM IN THE APPLICATION TO THE EFFECT THAT THE CONTESTED DECISION SHOULD BE DECLARED VOID MUST BE REJECTED .  THE ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR A REDUCTION OF THE FINE   THE COURT NOTES FIRST THAT THE FIFTH AND SIXTH SUBMISSIONS CONSIDERED PREVIOUSLY , WHICH MAY BE REGARDED AS ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN SUPPORT OF BOTH THE CLAIM FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE CONTESTED DECISION IS VOID AND THE CLAIM FOR A REDUCTION OF THE FINE , HAVE BEEN REJECTED BECAUSE THEY ARE BASED ON ALLEGATIONS WHICH HAVE PROVED TO BE FALSE .   SECONDLY , ALTHOUGH THE APPLICANT MAINTAINED THAT PAYMENT OF THE FINE IMPOSED ON IT WOULD FORCE IT TO CLOSE ITS WORKSHOPS AND TO LAY OFF ITS EMPLOYEES , THE COURT TAKES THE VIEW THAT THAT FACT , BY ITSELF , IS NOT SUCH AS TO ENABLE IT TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF THE FINE .   AS IT HAS ALREADY HELD ( IN ITS JUDMENT OF MAY IN JOINED CASES AND 312/, KLOCKNER V COMMISSION ( ) ECR ) THE SYSTEM OF PRODUCTION QUOTAS WOULD BE GRAVELY COMPROMISED IF EVERY UNDERTAKING WERE ABLE , BY PLEADING EMERGENCY DUE TO SERIOUS ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES , TO EXCUSE ITSELF FROM OBSERVANCE OF THE RESTRICTIONS AND TO EXCEED AT WILL THE PRODUCTION QUOTA ALLOCATED TO IT . THE CHAIN REACTION THEREBY RELEASED WOULD CULMINATE IN THE COLLAPSE OF THE SYSTEM , SO THAT ARTICLE OF THE TREATY WOULD BECOME A DEAD LETTER .   MOREOVER , IT APPEARS FROM THE EVIDENCE AND IN PARTICULAR FROM THE REPORT OF THE AUDIT CARRIED OUT ON SEPTEMBER AT FERRIERE SAN CARLO THAT ALTHOUGH THE APPLICANT ' S FINANCIAL POSITION DOES IN FACT GIVE CAUSE FOR     CONCERN , THE AUDITORS CONSIDER THAT A FURTHER FINANCIAL BURDEN , SUCH AS THAT ARISING FROM THE FINE IMPOSED BY THE COMMISSION , COULD BE SUPPORTED IF PAYMENTS COULD BE SPREAD OVER A PERIOD OF TIME . IT IS CLEAR FROM THE EVIDENCE AND IN PARTICULAR FROM THE ORAL PROCEEDINGS THAT THE COMMISSION IS WILLING TO ALLOW FERRIERE SAN CARLO TIME TO PAY PROVIDED THAT IT IS NOT TOO LONG .   THIRDLY , FERRIERE SAN CARLO MAINTAINS THAT THE FINE IMPOSED ON IT , WHICH WAS BASED ON A UNIFORM RATE OF 82.ECU PER EXCESS TONNE , INFRINGED THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE ECSC TREATY WHICH PROVIDES THAT THE COMMISSION ' ' MAY IMPOSE UPON UNDERTAKINGS WHICH DO NOT COMPLY WITH DECISIONS TAKEN BY IT UNDER THIS ARTICLE FINES NOT EXCEEDING THE VALUE OF THE TONNAGES PRODUCED IN DISREGARD THEREOF ' ' . MORE SPECIFICALLY THE APPLICANT IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE FINE SHOULD NOT EXCEED THE PROFIT ON THE EXCESS TONNAGE , AND RELIES IN THAT RESPECT ON THE ARGUMENT PRESENTED TO THE COURT BY FERRIERE DI ROE VOLCIANO IN CASE 234/.    THE COURT OBSERVES , FIRST , THAT AFORMENTIONED PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY ARE BASED ON THE NOTION OF THE VALUE OF THE TONNAGES PRODUCED IN DISREGARD OF THE QUOTA , NOT THE PROFIT REALIZED IN RESPECT OF SUCH PRODUCTION , AND SECONDLY THAT THE REFERENCE TO THE ARGUMENT PUT FORWARD BY FERRIERE DI ROE VOLCIANO IS IN ANY CASE UNJUSTIFIED SINCE THAT ARGUMENT WAS BASED ESSENTIALLY ON THE FACT THAT THAT UNDERTAKING OPERATED EXCLUSIVELY AS A PROCESSOR FOR OTHER UNDERTAKINGS ; THAT IS NOT THE CASE WITH THE APPLICANT . IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THERE WAS NO SPECIAL REASON IN THIS CASE TO DEPART FROM A STRICT APPLICATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE AND THE COMMISSION APPLIED IT CORRECTLY .   FINALLY , ALTHOUGH THE APPLICANT SOUGHT TO RELY ON ITS GOOD FAITH THE COURT HAS FOUND NO REASON IN THAT RESPECT TO JUSTIFY A REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF THE FINE .   IT FOLLOWS FROM THE WHOLE OF THE FOREGOING THAT THE CLAIM FOR A REDUCTION OF THE FINE MUST BE REJECTED .      THE CLAIM THAT THE COURT SHOULD GRANT THE APPLICANT ' ' TERMS AND PAYMENT PERIODS ' '  TAKING INTO ACCOUNT BOTH ITS FINANCIAL POSITION AND THE CURRENT SITUATION IN THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY   CLAIMS OF THIS SORT WHICH IN FACT REQUIRE THE COURT TO ISSUE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE COMMISSION , WHICH ALONE HAS THE POWER TO GRANT TERMS OF PAYMENT TO UNDERTAKINGS WHICH HAVE BEEN FINED , ARE MANIFESTLY INADMISSIBLE .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE PROVIDES THAT THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS . AS FERRIERE SAN CARLO HAS FAILED IN ITS SUBMISSIONS , IT MUST BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .
