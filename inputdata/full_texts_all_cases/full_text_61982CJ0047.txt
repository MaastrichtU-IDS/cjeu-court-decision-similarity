Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ANNEX A TO COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2792/OF DECEMBER ESTABLISHING IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS FALLING WITHIN CHAPTERS TO OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF A SCHEME OF GENERALIZED PREFERENCES IN FAVOUR OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), WITH REGARD TO TARIFF SUBHEADING 07.B I , 
Grounds
BY AN ORDER OF FEBRUARY , LODGED AT THE COURT ON FEBRUARY , THE TARIEFCOMMISSIE , AMSTERDAM , REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY , A QUESTION REGARDING THE INTERPRETATION OF SUBHEADING 07.B I CONTAINED IN ANNEX A TO COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2792/OF DECEMBER ESTABLISHING IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS FALLING WITHIN CHAPTERS TO OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF A SCHEME OF GENERALIZED PREFERENCES IN FAVOUR OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ).   THE SUBHEADING IS WORDED AS FOLLOWS :    ' ' PEAS ( INCLUDING CHICK PEAS ) AND BEANS ( OF THE SPECIES PHASEOLUS ):   BEANS OF THE GENUS ' PHASEOLUS MUNGO '  FREE  CHICK PEAS OF THE GENUS ' CICER ARIETINUM '  FREE  OTHER 3% ' '       ON FEBRUARY , THE APPELLANT IN THE MAIN ACTION , THE UNDERTAKING GEBROEDERS VISMANS , IMPORTED INTO THE NETHERLANDS CERTAIN PRODUCE FROM THAILAND DESCRIBED ON THE IMPORT DECLARATION AS ' ' GREEN MUNGBEANS INTENDED FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION ' ' . ON THE INVOICE , THE PRODUCE IN QUESTION WAS DESCRIBED AS ' ' THAI GREEN MUNGBEANS , NEW CROP , BIG POLISHED ' ' .   THE COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS AND EXCISE DUTIES IN ROTTERDAM , THE POINT OF ENTRY , CLASSIFIED THE GOODS UNDER TARIFF SUBHEADING 07.B I ' ' OTHER ' ' , WHICH ENTAILED IMPORT DUTY 3% .   ACCORDING TO THE ORDER , THE DISPUTE BROUGHT BEFORE THE TARIEFCOMMISSIE TO WHICH THE UNDERTAKING APPEALED AGAINST THE DISMISSAL OF ITS OBJECTION BY THE INSPECTOR OF CUSTOMS AND EXCISE , IS CONCERNED WITH THE DESIGNATION OF THE SPECIES ' ' PHASEOLUS MUNGO ' ' . IN THE IMPORTING UNDERTAKING ' S VIEW , THE SPECIES INCLUDES THE BEANS IN QUESTION , WHICH ARE USUALLY DESCRIBED AS ' ' MUNG BEANS ' '  OR ' ' GREEN GRAM ' ' , WHEREAS THE CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES CONSIDER THAT IT IS ONLY THE VARIETY KNOWN AS ' ' BLACK GRAM ' '  WHICH BELONGS TO THAT SPECIES .   SUCH WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE TARIEFCOMMISSIE REFERRED THE FOLLOWING QUESTION TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING :    ' ' ARE THE WORDS ' BEANS OF THE GENUS PHASEOLUS MUNGO . . . FREE '  USED UNDER SUBHEADING 07.B I IN ANNEX A TO COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2792/OF DECEMBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) MEANT TO EXEMPT FROM IMPORT DUTIES :    ( I ) BEANS OF THE TYPE KNOWN AS ' GREEN GRAM ' ;   ( II ) BEANS OF THE TYPE KNOWN AS ' BLACK GRAM ' ; OR   ( III ) BOTH TYPES OF BEANS? ' '   THE BOTANICAL STUDIES ATTACHED TO THE FILE DISCLOSE THAT THE SCIENTIFIC DESIGNATIONS OF THE TWO VARIETIES DIFFER FROM ONE STUDY TO THE NEXT . THAT     BEING SO , THE CONTESTED PROVISION SHOULD BE INTERPRETED IN TERMS OF ITS PURPOSE . IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE RECALLED THAT IT BELONGS WITHIN A SCHEME OF GENERALIZED PREFERENCES IN FAVOUR OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES . THUS THE QUESTION TO BE EXAMINED IS WHETHER EXEMPTING BOTH VARIETIES ACTUALLY SERVES A COMMERCIAL NEED OF THOSE COUNTRIES .   ACCORDING TO INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE COMMISSION DURING THE COURT PROCEEDINGS , THE EXEMPTION GRANTED TO BEANS OF THE VARIETY ' ' PHASEOLUS MUNGO ' '  HAD BEEN SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED BY INDIA , WHICH PRODUCES AND EXPORTS BOTH THE ABOVE-MENTIONED VARIETIES . STILL ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSION , THERE IS NOTHING TO SUGGEST , EITHER THAT THE INDIAN AUTHORITIES , IN SEEKING THE EXEMPTION , OR THE COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS , IN GRANTING IT , INTENDED TO EXCLUDE EITHER VARIETY .   THAT EVIDENCE IS BORNE OUT BY THE FACT THAT COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 3603/OF DECEMBER APPLYING GENERALIZED TARIFF PREFERENCES FOR IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS ORIGINATING IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) REPLACES THE EXPRESSION UNDER DISPUTE BY THE EXPRESSION ' ' BEANS OF THE GENUS ' PHASEOLUS '  ' ' , WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY REFERS TO BOTH VARIETIES .   IT FOLLOWS FROM THE FOREGOING THAT THE EXPRESSION ' ' BEANS OF THE GENUS ' PHASEOLUS MUNGO '  ' ' , IN ANNEX A TO COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2792/MUST BE INTERPRETED SO AS TO INCLUDE BEANS OF THE ' ' GREEN GRAM ' '  VARIETY AS WELL AS THOSE OF THE ' ' BLACK GRAM ' '  VARIETY .
