IN CASE 109/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE FIRST CIVIL DIVISION OF THE TRIBUNALE DI MILANO ( DISTRICT COURT , MILAN ) FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  EURICO SRL ,   PLAINTIFF ,   AND  COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ,   DEFENDANT ,   
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE COMMUNITY PROVISIONS REGARDING FOOD AID , FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEFINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY , THE NATIONAL INTERVENTION AGENCIES AND TRADERS WHEN AN OPERATION FORMING PART OF THE COMMUNITY FOOD-AID PROGRAMME IS CARRIED OUT , 
Grounds
BY ORDER OF MARCH , WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON JUNE , THE TRIBUNALE DI MILANO ( DISTRICT COURT , MILAN ) REFERRED A QUESTION TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF COMMUNITY LAW REGARDING THE COMMUNITY ' S FOOD-AID POLICY .   THAT QUESTION WAS RAISED IN PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALE DI MILANO , INITIALLY BETWEEN EURICO SRL AND THE ENTE NAZIONALE RISI AND LATER BETWEEN EURICO SRL AND THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , IN WHICH THE PLAINTIFF COMPANY SOUGHT PAYMENT OF THE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING ON A PUBLIC CONTRACT WHICH IT HAD CONCLUDED WITH THE ENTE NAZIONALE RISI .       BY DECISION 76/OF SEPTEMBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), ADDRESSED TO THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC , THE COMMISSION DECIDED THAT THE ENTE NAZIONALE RISI , AN ITALIAN INTERVENTION AGENCY WITH PARTICULAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR CARRYING OUT AND SUPERVISING OPERATIONS RELATING TO FOOD-AID ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' ' THE ENR ' ' ), WAS TO CONCLUDE A PRIVATE CONTRACT FOR THE PURCHASE ON THE COMMUNITY MARKET OF TONNES OF RICE AND FOR THE SUPPLY OF THE PRODUCT TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE NIGER .   EURICO WAS CHOSEN BY THE ENR AS THE OTHER CONTRACTING PARTY AND PERFORMED THAT CONTRACT , BUT THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT SUPPLIED WAS CRITICIZED BY THE AUTHORITIES IN THE COUNTRY OF DESTINATION . FOR THAT REASON , THE ENR , IN COMPLIANCE WITH TELEX MESSAGES RECEIVED FROM THE COMMISSION AND AFTER INITIALLY SUSPENDING PAYMENT OF THE INVOICE ISSUED TO IT BY EURICO , MADE ONLY A PAYMENT ON ACCOUNT OF LIT , ALTHOUGH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE INVOICE WAS LIT . THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS RELATE TO THE RECOVERY BY EURICO OF THE OUTSTANDING AMOUNT OF LIT MILLION .   FOR THAT PURPOSE , IN DECEMBER , EURICO SUED THE ENR BEFORE THE TRIBUNALE DI MILANO WHICH , BY JUDGMENT OF JUNE , DISMISSED THE PLAINTIFF ' S CLAIM ON THE GROUND THAT THE ENR WAS NOT A PROPER DEFENDANT SINCE IT HAD ACTED AS A DULY AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMMISSION AND THAT THE ACTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT DIRECTLY AGAINST THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES .   EURICO THEREFORE BROUGHT AN ACTION AGAINST THE COMMISSION BEFORE THE SAME COURT FOR AN ORDER THAT IT SHOULD PAY THE SUM OF LIT MILLION TOGETHER WITH INTEREST AND A SUM IN RESPECT OF MONETARY DEPRECIATION . THE COMMISSION RAISED THE PRELIMINARY OBJECTION THAT IT WAS NOT A PROPER DEFENDANT AND IT CONTENDED THAT BOTH THE ARGUMENT ACCEPTED BY THE TRIBUNALE IN ITS FIRST JUDGMENT , REFERRED TO ABOVE , AND THE APPLICATION ITSELF , WERE WITHOUT FOUNDATION .   THE TRIBUNALE DI MILANO CONSIDERED THAT IT HAD JURISDICTION BY VIRTUE OF THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE THEREOF AND THAT IT WAS ENTITLED TO ESTABLISH WHETHER OR NOT THE ENR HAD ACTED AS A DULY AUTHORIZED AGENT OF THE COMMISSION IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOOD-AID OPERATION AT ISSUE . IN THE NATIONAL COURT ' S VIEW , ' ' THE COMMISSION AND , THEREFORE , PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE TREATY , THE EUROPEAN     ECONOMIC COMMUNITY , ARE BOUND TO FULFIL THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS IN THE CAPACITY OF PARTY TO THE CONTRACT ONLY IF THAT QUESTION IS ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE ' ' . IN ORDER TO RESOLVE ITS DOUBTS AS TO THE REPLY TO BE GIVEN TO THAT QUESTION , IT STAYED THE PROCEEDINGS AND SUBMITTED THE FOLLOWING QUESTION TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING :    ' ' WAS THE ENTE NAZIONALE RISI , THE ITALIAN INTERVENTION AGENCY , VESTED WITH SPECIFIC AUTHORITY TO ACT IN THE NAME OF THE EEC ( ' ' MANDATO CON RAPPRESENTANZA ' ' ) FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONCLUDING THE PRIVATE CONTRACT FOR THE PURCHASE OF METRIC TONS OF HUSKED LONG-GRAIN RICE INTENDED FOR THE REPUBLIC OF THE NIGER BY VIRTUE OF THE COMMISSION DECISION OF DECEMBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L OF . . , P . ) AND THE LEGISLATIVE MEASURES REFERRED TO THEREIN EXPRESSLY OR BY IMPLICATION?  ' '   IT IS APPARENT FROM THE FACTS OF THE CASE AS THEY HAVE JUST BEEN SET OUT AND FROM THE GROUNDS OF THE ORDER FOR REFERENCE THAT THE QUESTION SUBMITTED BY THE NATIONAL COURT SEEKS , IN REALITY , TO ETABLISH WHETHER IT IS TO THE COMMISSION OR TO THE NATIONAL INTERVENTION AGENCY THAT ANY LIABILITY WOULD ATTACH , UNDER THE COMMUNITY PROVISIONS REGARDING FOOD AID WHICH WERE IN FORCE AT THE DATE OF THE COMMISSION DECISION OF SEPTEMBER , VIS-A-VIS AN UNDERTAKING WHICH THE NATIONAL INTERVENTION AGENCY HAD CHOSEN AS THE OTHER PARTY TO A CONTRACT AND HAD INSTRUCTED TO CARRY OUT A FOOD-AID OPERATION DECIDED ON BY THE COMMISSION .  THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT TO RULE ON THE QUESTION   ACCORDING TO THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS , A QUESTION OF THE KIND SUBMITTED FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THIS CASE CANNOT FALL WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE SINCE IN ORDER TO REPLY TO THAT QUESTION IT WOULD HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER THE ENR WAS TO BE REGARDED AS THE COMMISSION ' S AGENT UNDER THE TERMS OF THE ITALIAN CIVIL CODE AND WOULD HAVE TO APPRAISE FACTS WHICH FELL FOR CONSIDERATION SOLELY BY THE ITALIAN COURT DEALING WITH THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CASE .   IT IS APPARENT FROM AN EXAMINATION OF THE ACTUAL PURPOSE , AS STATED ABOVE , OF THE QUESTION REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING , THAT , CONTRARY TO THE CONTENTION OF THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS , THAT QUESTION IS NOT OF SUCH A NATURE AS TO LEAD THE COURT OF JUSTICE TO APPRAISE THE NATURE OF THE LEGAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ENR AND THE COMMISSION UNDER THE TERMS OF     THE ITALIAN CIVIL CODE , NOR IS IT OF SUCH A NATURE AS TO ENTAIL AN APPRAISAL OF FACTS WHICH FALL FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE ITALIAN COURT ALONE . SINCE FOOD AID CONSTITUTES INTERVENTION BY THE COMMUNITY , ONLY AN ANALYSIS OF COMMUNITY LAW IS RELEVANT TO THE REPLY TO SUCH A QUESTION .  THE REPLY TO BE GIVEN TO THE QUESTION   THE PLAINTIFF COMPANY IN THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS CONSIDERS THAT BY CONCLUDING A CONTRACT SUCH AS THE ONE AT ISSUE , THE ENTE NAZIONALE RISI ACTED , IN THE CAPACITY OF AN AUTHORIZED AGENT , ON BEHALF OF THE COMMISSION . IN SUPPORT OF THAT VIEW IT RELIES UPON THE FOLLOWING ARGUMENTS :   AS A MATTER OF LAW , THE EXISTENCE OF THAT AGENCY RELATIONSHIP CAN BE DEDUCED , ON THE ONE HAND , FROM THE TERMS OF THE COMMISSION DECISION OF SEPTEMBER , ARTICLE OF WHICH IMPOSES AN OBLIGATION DIRECTLY UPON THE ENR AND , ON THE OTHER HAND , FROM AN EXAMINATION OF THE COMMUNITY RULES , FROM WHICH IT IS APPARENT THAT COMMUNITY FOOD-AID OPERATIONS CONSTITUTE THE PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS WHICH ARE ENTIRELY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY AND THAT THE ACTION OF THE NATIONAL INTERVENTION AGENCIES IN SUCH FOOD-AID OPERATIONS IS TAKEN DIRECTLY ON BEHALF OF THE EEC . FOR THAT REASON , THE PRINCIPLES CONCERNING THE DIVISION OF POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AS BETWEEN THE COMMUNITIES AND THE MEMBER STATES OR THEIR INTERVENTION AGENCIES , DEVELOPED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY , CANNOT BE TRANSPOSED TO THE FIELD OF FOOD AID .  AS REGARDS THE FACTS , THE EXISTENCE OF THE AGENCY RELATIONSHIP IS CONFIRMED BY THE COMMISSION ' S BEHAVIOUR DURING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CONTRACT , SINCE IT INVOLVED ITSELF TOTALLY AT EVERY STAGE OF THE CONTRACT AND THUS INTENDED TO TAKE DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL THE EFFECTS OF THE CONTRACT CONCLUDED ON ITS BEHALF BY THE ENR .    IT IS TRUE THAT FOOD AID CONSTITUTES A COMMUNITY ACTION , FINANCED OUT OF COMMUNITY FUNDS AND THAT , FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW , THE INTERVENTION OF THE MEMBER STATES AND THEIR AGENCIES IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A FOOD-AID OPERATION CONTRIBUTES TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF COMMUNITY OBJECTIVES . THAT VERY GENERAL STATEMENT IS , HOWEVER , INSUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE A USEFUL ANSWER TO THE     QUESTION RAISED . THE WAY IN WHICH THE RELEVANT COMMUNITY LEGISLATION PROVIDES FOR THE ORGANIZATION AND FINANCING OF FOOD-AID MUST ALSO BE EXAMINED SO AS TO DETERMINE THE ROLE AND THE POWERS OF THE NATIONAL INTERVENTION AGENCIES IN THAT REGARD .   IT SHOULD BE NOTED IN THE FIRST PLACE , AS THE COMMISSION EMPHASIZES , THAT WHEN THE EVENTS WHICH GAVE RISE TO THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS TOOK PLACE , THE RULES GOVERNING THE GRANTING OF FOOD-AID WERE CLOSELY MODELLED ON THOSE GOVERNING THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY .   AS REGARDS THE GENERAL FRAMEWORK IN WHICH FOOD-AID OPERATIONS ARE CARRIED OUT , THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH OBLIGATIONS ARISING UNDER AGREEMENTS RELATING TO FOOD-AID ARE TO BE CARRIED OUT AND THE CONDITIONS FOR DETERMINATION OF THE CRITERIA FOR THE MOBILIZATION OF GOODS INTENDED FOR FOOD-AID ARE LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 2727/OF THE COUNCIL OF OCTOBER ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN CEREALS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) AND ARTICLE OF COUNCIL REGULATION NO 1418/OF JUNE ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN RICE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ).   WITH REGARD , MORE PARTICULARLY , TO THE WAY IN WHICH FOOD-AID OPERATIONS INVOLVING CEREALS ARE CARRIED OUT , REGULATION NO 2750/OF THE COUNCIL OF OCTOBER FIXING CRITERIA FOR THE MOBILIZATION OF CEREALS INTENDED AS FOOD AID ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) ESTABLISHES A CLOSE LINK BETWEEN THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY AND FOOD AID , IN PARTICULAR , BY ENTRUSTING THE TASK OF MOBILIZING THE PRODUCTS INTENDED TO BE USED AS FOOD AID TO THE INTERVENTION AGENCIES SET UP WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY AND BY LAYING DOWN THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE MANAGEMENT OF CEREAL CONTRACTS AND WITHDRAWALS OF CEREALS INTENDED TO BE USED AS FOOD AID SHOULD BE COORDINATED .   IT IS ESSENTIAL TO EMPHASIZE , IN THE SECOND PLACE , AS THE COMMISSION HAS ALSO POINTED OUT , THAT WHEN THE EVENTS WHICH GAVE RISE TO THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS TOOK PLACE , THE PROVISIONS IN FORCE REGARDING THE FINANCING OF THE FOOD-AID POLICY , AND IN PARTICULAR , REGULATION NO 2681/OF THE COUNCIL OF OCTOBER ON COMMUNITY FINANCING OF EXPENDITURE INCURRED IN RESPECT OF THE SUPPLY OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS AS FOOD AID ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L ,     P . ), PROVIDED FOR MACHINERY AND A SYSTEM OF MANAGEMENT WHICH WERE PRACTICALLY IDENTICAL TO THOSE ESTABLISHED FOR INTERVENTION IN THE AGRICULTURAL MARKETS .   IT IS APPARENT FROM THE ANALYSIS OF THE COMMUNITY PROVISIONS THAT THE RULES IN FORCE WHEN THE EVENTS WHICH GAVE RISE TO THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS TOOK PLACE DIVIDED POWERS RELATING TO FOOD AID AS BETWWN THE COMMUNITY AND THE MEMBER STATES IN A MANNER IDENTICAL TO THAT LAID DOWN FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY .   WITH REGARD TO THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY , THE COURT HAS ALREADY HAD OCCASION TO RULE ON THE SCOPE OF THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS CONCERNING THE POWERS OF THE MEMBER STATES AND THEIR INTERVENTION AGENCIES , AS WELL AS THEIR NON-CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY TOWARDS THIRD PARTIES . ACCORDING TO WELL-ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW ( JUDGMENT OF . . IN CASE 60/, CARMINE RUSSO V AIMA , ( ) ECR ; JUDGMENT OF . . IN CASE 101/, GRANARIA BV V HOOFDPRODUKTSCHAP VOOR AKKERBOUWPRODUKTEN , ( ) ECR ; JUDGMENT OF . . IN CASE 217/, COMPAGNIE INTERAGRA SA V COMMISSION ( ) ECR ), THE QUESTION OF COMPENSATION BY A NATIONAL AGENCY FOR DAMAGE CAUSED TO PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS BY THE AGENCIES AND SERVANTS OF MEMBER STATES , EITHER BY REASON OF AN INFRINGEMENT OF COMMUNITY LAW OR BY AN ACT OR OMISSION CONTRARY TO NATIONAL LAW , IN THE APPLICATION OF COMMUNITY LAW , IS ENTIRELY A MATTER FOR THE MEMBER STATE OR FOR THE AGENCY ACTING ON ITS BEHALF AND MUST BE DETERMINED BY THE NATIONAL COURTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NATIONAL LAW OF THE MEMBER STATE CONCERNED , WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE COURTS SUBMITTING QUESTIONS TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY .   THE SAME PRINCIPLES MUST BE APPLIED TO CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY WHERE THE NATIONAL INTERVENTION AGENCIES CONCLUDE CONTRACTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF GIVING EFFECT TO COMMUNITY LAW REGARDING FOOD AID . CONSEQUENTLY , ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS IN FORCE DURING THE PERIOD TO WHICH THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS RELATE , ONLY THE INTERVENTION AGENCY OF THE MEMBER STATE CONCERNED , TO WHICH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION WAS ENTRUSTED , CAN INCUR LIABILITY TOWARDS PRIVATE TRADERS WITH WHOM IT HAS CONCLUDED CONTRACTS , EVEN THOUGH THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF THE FOOD-AID OPERATION MUST ULTIMATELY BE BORNE BY THE COMMUNITY .       IN THAT CONTEXT , THE FACT THAT THE COMMISSION INTERVENED IN A VERY ACTIVE WAY DURING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CONTRACT AT ISSUE IS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANCE AS REGARDS THE DIVISIONS OF POWERS AND LIABILITY AS BEWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND THE ITALIAN INTERVENTION AGENCY . EVEN IF IT IS ACCEPTED THAT THE LETTERS AND TELEX MESSAGES SENT TO THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC OR TO ITS INTERVENTION AGENCY BY THE COMMISSION WENT BEYOND THE POWERS OF SUPERVISION GRANTED TO THE COMMISSION BY ARTICLE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED REGULATION NO 2681/OF THE COUNCIL , AND HOWEVER AMBIGUOUSLY THEY MAY HAVE BEEN DRAFTED , THEY DID NOT BIND THE NATIONAL AUTHORITIES AND HAD NO LEGAL EFFECT OTHER THAN TO EXPRESS THE OPINION OF THE COMMISSION . AS THE COURT HAS HELD ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS ( JUDGMENT OF . . IN CASE 133/, SUCRIMEX V COMMISSION , ( ) ECR ; JUDGMENT OF . . IN CASE 217/, INTERAGRA V COMMISSION , CITED ABOVE ), THE EXPRESSION OF THOSE OPINIONS FORMS PART OF THE INTERNAL COOPERATION BETWEEN THE COMMISSION AND THE NATIONAL BODIES RESPONSIBLE FOR APPLYING COMMUNITY RULES IN THAT FIELD AND THAT COOPERATION CANNOT MAKE THE COMMUNITY LIABLE TO INDIVIDUALS .   MOREOVER , IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE COMMISSION DECISION OF SEPTEMBER WAS IN FACT ADDRESSED TO THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC , AS REQUIRED BY THE PROVISIONS REFERRED TO ABOVE RELATING TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FOOD AID . ALTHOUGH THE ITALIAN INTERVENTION AGENCY WAS DESIGNATED BY NAME THEREIN , THAT FACT IS ACCOUNTED FOR BY TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS RELATING IN PARTICULAR TO THE URGENCY WITH WHICH THE FOOD-AID OPERATION HAD TO BE CARRIED OUT IN THAT CASE AND LIKEWISE CANNOT IN ANY WAY AFFECT THE DIVISION OF POWERS AND LIABILITY AS BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND THE NATIONAL INTERVENTION AGENCY .   THE REPLY TO THE QUESTION SUBMITTED BY THE NATIONAL COURT MUST THEREFORE BE THAT THE EFFECT OF THE PROVISIONS OF COMMUNITY LAW REGARDING FOOD AID IN FORCE AT THE TIME OF THE COMMISSION DECISION OF SEPTEMBER IS THAT ONLY THE NATIONAL INTERVENTION AGENCY OF THE MEMBER STATE CONCERNED , WHICH WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR CARRYING OUT AND SUPERVISING FOOD-AID OPERATIONS DECIDED ON BY THE COMMISSION , CAN BE HELD LIABLE TO THE UNDERTAKING TO WHICH IT HAS , BY CONTRACT , DELEGATED THE ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OPERATIONS FOR ANY DAMAGE SUFFERED BY THE LATTER IN THE COURSE OF CARRYING OUT THAT FOOD-AID OPERATION .
