Commission
 by which the Court dismissed the application for annulment of Commission Decision 2006/262/EC of September declaring
                  State aid which Germany is planning to implement for the appellant to be incompatible with the common market (OJ L 94,
                  p. 50) – Proposed aid intended to amend aid previously granted to the recipient undertaking notified to the Commission after
                  the investment project had been carried out in full by means of the aid initially approved – Incorrect assessment of the incentive
                  effect and of the necessity of the aid at issue.
               
Operative part: 
1.
	Dismisses the appeal;
