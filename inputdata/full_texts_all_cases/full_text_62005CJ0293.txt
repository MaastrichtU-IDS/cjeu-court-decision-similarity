Re: 
Failure of a Member State to fulfil obligations – Breach of Article 5(2) of Council Directive 91/271/EEC of May concerning
                  urban waste-water treatment (OJ L 135, p. 40) – Insufficiently stringent treatment of urban waste-water from the agglomeration
                  of several communes of the Province of Varese situated in the basin of the River Olona.
               
Operative part 
The Court:
1.
Declares that, by failing to take measures to ensure that, as from December 1998, urban waste water from the agglomeration
                     of several communes of the Province of Varese situated in the basin of the River Olona is subject to more stringent treatment
                     than the secondary treatment or equivalent treatment provided for in Article of Council Directive 91/271/EEC of May concerning urban waste-water treatment, the Italian Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 5(2) and (5)
                     of that directive;
                  
2.
Orders the Italian Republic to pay the costs.
