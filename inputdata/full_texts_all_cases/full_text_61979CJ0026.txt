Summary
. ALTHOUGH IN EXERCISING THEIR POWERS THE INSTITUTIONS MUST ENSURE THAT THE BURDENS WHICH COMMERCIAL OPERATORS ARE REQUIRED TO BEAR ARE NO GREATER THAN IS REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THE AIM WHICH THE AUTHORITIES ARE TO ACCOMPLISH , IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY FOLLOW THAT THAT OBLIGATION MUST BE MEASURED IN RELATION TO THE INDIVIDUAL SITUATION OF ANY ONE PARTICULAR GROUP OF OPERATORS .  . A TRANSACTION IS NOT ' ' EFFECTED ' '  WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF DECISION NO 962/77/ECSC , WHICH IS INTENDED TO PROHIBIT ALL TRANSACTIONS BELOW A MINIMUM PRICE FROM MAY THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY , UNTIL THE EXACT PRICE ACTUALLY CHARGED IS FIXED . IF THE PRICE REMAINS UNCERTAIN , BECAUSE THERE IS NO PRICE INDICATED IN THE CONTRACT OR BECAUSE REFERENCE IS MADE TO LIST PRICES ' ' IN FORCE AT THE     TIME OF DESPATCH ' ' , THE TRANSACTION CANNOT BE REGARDED AS HAVING BEEN EFFECTED WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THAT DECISION .   . UNDER A SYSTEM OF MINIMUM PRICES SUCH AS THAT LAID DOWN BY GENERAL DECISION NO 962/77/ECSC , TRANSACTIONS WHICH ARE STILL TO BE CONCLUDED OR COMPLETED MUST ALL COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENT INHERENT IN THE IMPOSITION OF SUCH PRICES , SO THAT ANY PRACTICE ENTAILING REBATES AND CREDIT NOTES DEVOID OF ANY REAL SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE RELIED ON TO JUSTIFY SALES AT PRICES LOWER THAN THE MINIMUM PRICES IMPOSED . WHATEVER METHOD OF CALCULATION IS USED , THE ACTUAL PRICE , CALCULATED AFTER THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE DECISION , MAY NOT THEREFORE BE LOWER THAN THE MINIMUM PRICES .

Subject of the case
APPLICATIONS FOR THE ANNULMENT OF SUCCESSIVE DECISIONS OF THE COMMISSION OF JANUARY AND OF MAY ORDERING THE APPLICANT TO PAY A FINE UNDER ARTICLES AND OF THE ECSC TREATY FOR SELLING CONCRETE REINFORCEMENT BARS BELOW THE MINIMUM PRICES FIXED BY GENERAL DECISION NO 962/77/ECSC OF MAY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L OF MAY , P . ).  
Grounds
BY A FIRST APPLICATION RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON FEBRUARY THE APPLICANT COMPANY , FORGES DE THY-MARCINELLE ET MONCEAU S.A ., CHALLENGED ON THE BASIS OF ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY AN INDIVIDUAL DECISION OF THE COMMISSION OF JANUARY ORDERING IT TO PAY A FINE OF EUROPEAN UNITS OF ACCOUNT , THAT IS BFR , FOR IRREGULAR SALES OF CONCRETE REINFORCEMENT BARS AT PRICES LOWER THAN THE MINIMUM PRICES FIXED BY GENERAL DECISION NO 962/77/ECSC OF MAY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ) ADOPTED PURSUANT TO SUBPARAGRAPH ( B ) OF THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY . IN THAT DECISION OF JANUARY THE COMMISSION ASSESSED THE VALUE OF THE DISPUTED SALES AT BFR AND THE EXTENT OF THE UNDERPRICING IN RELATION TO THE MINIMUM PRICES AT BFR IN RESPECT OF THE SALE OF 977.TONNES OF CONCRETE REINFORCEMENT BARS . THE FINE WAS THUS FIXED AT 10% OF THE EXTENT OF THE UNDERPRICING ESTIMATED BY THE COMMISSION AT THAT TIME .       THE DECISION OF JANUARY WAS AMENDED BY THE COMMISSION BY A NEW DECISION OF MAY WHICH REDUCED THE FINE TO EUROPEAN UNITS OF ACCOUNT , THAT IS BFR , PURSUANT TO OBSERVATIONS BY THE APPLICANT WHICH SHOWED THAT THE EXTENT OF THE UNDERPRICING WAS ONLY BFR IN RESPECT OF 424.TONNES , THE VALUE OF THE IRREGULAR SALES BEING REDUCED TO BFR .    BY A SECOND APPLICATION RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON MAY THE APPLICANT COMPANY CHALLENGED THE AMENDING DECISION OF MAY . THE TWO CASES WERE JOINED BY ORDER OF JUNE FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE PROCEDURE AND OF JUDGMENT .  A - THE OBJECTION OF UNLAWFULNESS RAISED AGAINST GENERAL DECISION NO 962/77/ECSC   ( A ) ADMISSIBILITY   IN ITS FIRST APPLICATION , TO CHALLENGE THE LAWFULNESS OF DECISION NO 962/77/ECSC OF MAY FIXING THE MINIMUM PRICES FOR CONCRETE REINFORCEMENT BARS , THE APPLICANT CONFINED ITSELF TO ALLUDING TO ' ' VARIOUS REASONS ' '  WITHOUT MENTIONING THEM . SUCH A STATEMENT OF REASONS DOES NOT SATISFY ARTICLE ( ) ( C ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COURT WHICH REQUIRES THAT THE APPLICATION SHOULD STATE ' ' THE GROUNDS ON WHICH THE APPLICATION IS BASED ' ' . ON THE OTHER HAND , THE SECOND APPLICATION MEETS THAT REQUIREMENT , CLARIFYING THE SAME SUBMISSION BY RELIANCE ON AN INFRINGEMENT OF THE PRINCIPLES OF NON-DISCRIMINATION AND OF PROPORTIONALITY . AS THE TWO CASES ARE JOINED , THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE SECOND APPLICATION COVERS ANY INADMISSIBILITY OF THE FIRST AND THE ARGUMENTS PUT FORWARD IN SUPPORT OF THE SUBMISSION IN THE REPLY IN CASE 26/MUST THEREFORE BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN DECIDING THE JOINED CASES .      ( B ) THE OBJECTION OF LACK OF PROPORTIONALITY   THE APPLICANT ARGUES THAT TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH DECISION NO 962/WAS NOT REPLACED BY DECISION NO 3000/OF DECEMBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ) WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF ' ' BASIC PRICES ' '  APPLICABLE TO IMPORTS FROM NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES ( COMMISSION STATEMENT PUBLISHED IN OFFICIAL JOURNAL L OF DECEMBER ), IT WAS ' ' UNAVAILING , NOT TO SAY DAMAGING , AND WAS AN EXTREME CASE OF VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY ' ' . WHILST , ACCORDING TO THE APPLICANT , DECISION NO 962/WAS INTENDED TO REMEDY THE COLLAPSE OF THE MARKET FOR CONCRETE REINFORCEMENT BARS AND THE DETERIORATING FINANCIAL POSITION OF UNDERTAKINGS , ' ' THE MEANS USED WERE WHOLLY INADEQUATE ' ' .   IN ITS JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER ( CASE 5/BALKAN ( ) ECR AT P . ) THE COURT HAS ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ALTHOUGH IN EXERCISING THEIR POWERS THE INSTITUTIONS MUST ENSURE THAT THE BURDENS WHICH COMMERCIAL OPERATORS ARE REQUIRED TO BEAR ARE NO GREATER THAN IS REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THE AIM WHICH THE AUTHORITIES ARE TO ACCOMPLISH , IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY FOLLOW THAT THAT OBLIGATION MUST BE MEASURED IN RELATION TO THE INDIVIDUAL SITUATION OF ANY ONE PARTICULAR GROUP OF OPERATORS . EVEN IF IT MAY BE ADMITTED THAT GENERAL DECISION NO 962/WAS DEFECTIVE AND INSUFFICIENT IN REGARD TO THE MATTER OF IMPORTS FROM NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES , THERE IS NO EVIDENCE IN THE APPLICANT ' S ARGUMENTS TO SHOW THAT THOSE RULES IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS WHICH WERE OUT OF KEEPING WITH THE COMMON INTEREST AND THAT THEY CONSTITUTED A DISPROPORTIONATE MEASURE IN RELATION TO THE AIM WHICH THEY SOUGHT TO ACHIEVE . IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT OBJECTION CAN ONLY BE DISMISSED .   ( C ) THE OBJECTION OF DISCRIMINATION   RELYING ON THE FACTS DESCRIBED ABOVE , THE APPLICANT ARGUES THAT THE COMMUNITY UNDERTAKINGS BOUND BY DECISION NO 962/SUFFERED DISCRIMINATION IN RELATION TO UNDERTAKINGS IN NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES WHICH WERE ABLE TO ACT IN COMPLETE FREEDOM UP TO DECEMBER . IT BELIEVES THAT IT HAS THUS BEEN A VICTIM OF THAT FORM OF DISCRIMINATION CONSISTING OF TREATING SIMILAR SITUATIONS UNEQUALLY .       THERE IS HOWEVER NO SIMILARITY OF SITUATION HERE ; DECISION NO 962/OF ITSELF COVERS ONLY THE PRICES TO BE CHARGED BY COMMUNITY UNDERTAKINGS , WHICH ARE THE ONLY ONES REFERRED TO BY THE SAID DECISION , IN REGARD TO SALES TO BE EFFECTED WITHIN THE COMMUNITY .   THE APPLICANT ALSO REFERRED TO THE TEMPORARY LACUNA IN THE RULES IN THAT THEY DID NOT APPLY TO PRODUCERS IN NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES .   IT HAS NOT HOWEVER PROVED THAT THOSE PRODUCERS ACTUALLY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT LACUNA IN ORDER TO INFLUENCE THE MARKET TO THE POINT OF APPRECIABLY WORSENING ITS FINANCIAL SITUATION . CONSEQUENTLY , EVEN IF THE MEASURE IN DISPUTE DID REQUIRE SACRIFICES OF CERTAIN UNDERTAKINGS FOR THE SAKE OF COMMUNITY SOLIDARITY , IT DID NOT CAUSE THEM UNDUE HARDSHIP . THAT OBJECTION MUST THEREFORE BE DISMISSED ALSO .  B - THE ANNULMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS IMPOSING FINES ON THE APPLICANT   THERE ARE NO GROUNDS FOR DISTINGUISHING THE DECISION OF JANUARY FROM THE AMENDING DECISION OF MAY . THE POSITION OF THE APPLICANT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF THOSE TWO DECISIONS AFTER THE AMENDMENT WAS MADE .   THE OBJECTION MADE BY THE APPLICANT AGAINST THE INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS IN SUIT IS THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO APPLY GENERAL DECISION NO 962/TO ' ' TRANSACTIONS EFFECTED ' '  BEFORE THE DATE OF APPLICATION OF THE SAID DECISION , WHICH STATES THAT THE MINIMUM PRICES ARE COMPULSORY FOR TRANSACTIONS ' ' EFFECTED ON OR AFTER THE THIRD DAY FOLLOWING ( ITS ) ENTRY INTO FORCE ' ' . ACCORDING TO THE APPLICANT , IT WAS ONLY THE DELIVERY OF THE CONCRETE REINFORCEMENT BARS WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENT TO THAT DATE SINCE THE TRANSACTIONS THEMSELVES , THAT IS TO SAY THE CONTRACTS , HAD BEEN CONCLUDED PRIOR TO THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE GENERAL DECISION . THAT ARGUMENT , THE APPLICANT SAYS , APPLIES EQUALLY TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONCLUDED WITH THE BELGIAN FIRMS JOURET AND DEMA AND TO THOSE CONCLUDED WITH THE FRENCH FIRM DAVUM , WHICH THE APPLICANT SAYS IT EFFECTED ON APRIL , APRIL AND AND MAY RESPECTIVELY , THOSE DATES BEING THE ONES ON THE ORDER FORMS . THOSE FOUR TRANSACTIONS , IN WHICH THE AGREED PRICE WAS THE LIST PRICE ' ' IN FORCE AT THE TIME OF DESPATCH ' ' , WERE THEREFORE EFFECTED , IT ARGUES , BEFORE MAY , THE DATE ON WHICH DECISION NO 962/ENTERED INTO FORCE , AND THE ACTUAL PRICE WAS THEREFORE DETERMINED IN ADVANCE BY REFERENCE TO A PRICE LIST IN FORCE .       THAT LINE OF ARGUMENT JUST BE REJECTED . A TRANSACTION IS NOT ' ' EFFECTED ' '  WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF DECISION NO 962/, WHICH IS INTENDED TO PROHIBIT ALL TRANSACTIONS BELOW A MINIMUM PRICE FROM MAY THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY , UNTIL THE EXACT PRICE ACTUALLY CHARGED IS FIXED . IF THE PRICE REMAINS UNCERTAIN , AS IS THE CASE HERE , BECAUSE THERE IS NO PRICE INDICATED IN THE CONTRACT OR BECAUSE REFERENCE IS MADE TO LIST PRICES ' ' IN FORCE AT THE TIME OF DESPATCH ' ' , THE TRANSACTION CANNOT BE REGARDED AS HAVING BEEN EFFECTED WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF DECISION NO 962/.    TO THAT FIRST FINDING MUST BE ADDED THE FACT THAT THE PRICE ACTUALLY PAID BY THE BUYERS FURTHER INVOLVED A REBATE AS AGAINST THE LIST PRICE IN FORCE AT THE TIME OF DESPATCH .   IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT UNDER A SYSTEM OF MINIMUM PRICES TRANSACTIONS WHICH ARE STILL TO BE CONCLUDED OR COMPLETED MUST ALL COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENT INHERENT IN THE IMPOSITION OF SUCH PRICES , SO THAT ANY PRACTICE , SUCH AS IN THIS CASE , ENTAILING REBATES AND CREDIT NOTES DEVOID OF ANY REAL SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE RELIED ON TO JUSTIFY SALES AT PRICES LOWER THAN THE MINIMUM PRICES IMPOSED . WHATEVER METHOD OF CALCULATION IS USED , THE ACTUAL PRICE , CALCULATED AFTER THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF DECISION NO 962/, MAY NOT THEREFORE BE LOWER THAN THE MINIMUM PRICES .   THE APPLICATIONS FOR ANNULMENT SHOULD CONSEQUENTLY BE DISMISSED .  C - THE AMOUNT OF THE FINE   AFTER ESTABLISHING THAT THE APPLICANT WAS EXPERIENCING DIFFICULTIES OF AN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL NATURE , AND IN VIEW OF ITS FINANCIAL POSITION , THE COMMISSION IMPOSED UPON IT ONLY A FINE EQUIVALENT TO 10% OF THE UNDERPRICING PRACTISED . EQUITABLE ACCOUNT WAS THEREFORE TAKEN OF THE POSITION IN WHICH THE APPLICANT FOUND ITSELF .   IN CASE 86/THE APPLICANT CHALLENGED THE CALCULATION OF THE FINE REDUCED BY THE AMENDING DECISION OF MAY ; IT ARGUES THAT INSTEAD OF BEING PROPORTIONAL TO THE AMOUNT OF THE UNDERPRICING THAT REDUCTION OF THE FINE SHOULD     BE PROPORTIONAL TO THE AMOUNT OF THE IRREGULAR TRANSACTIONS . IT SHOULD BE NOTED IN REGARD TO THIS MATTER THAT THE CRITICIZED METHOD OF CALCULATION WAS USED BY THE COMMISSION IN CONNEXION WITH ALL THE INFRINGEMENTS OF GENERAL DECISION NO 962/COMMITTED BY AVERAGE-SIZED UNDERTAKINGS OPERATING AT A LOSS AND THAT IT WAS APPROVED BY THE COURT .
