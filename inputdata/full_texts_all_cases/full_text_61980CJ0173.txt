Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE APPLICANT ' S CLASSIFICATION IN CAREER BRACKET B 2/B IS INCORRECT AND FOR COMPENSATION FOR THE DAMAGE CAUSED THEREBY , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JULY VOLKER BLASIG , AN OFFICIAL OF THE COMMISSION , BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR AN ORDER THAT THE COMMISSION PLACE HIM IN GRADE B WITH RETROACTIVE EFFECT FROM OCTOBER AND PAY HIM THE DIFFERENCE , WITH INTEREST , BETWEEN THE SALARY ACTUALLY PAID AND THAT WHICH HE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED AS AN OFFICIAL IN GRADE B .  THE APPLICANT COMMENCED HIS DUTIES IN AFTER TAKING PART IN AN OPEN COMPETITION ( COMPETITION NO COM/B/) FOR THE POST OF SENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT IN GRADES AND OF CATEGORY B . IN THE COMPETITION NOTICE THE DUTIES WERE DESCRIBED AS THOSE OF AN : ' ' EXECUTIVE OFFICIAL WHO , ON THE BASIS OF GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS , CARRIES OUT DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX TASKS , IN PARTICULAR THE PREPARATION AND REFINEMENT OF PROGRAMMES FOR THIRD-GENERATION COMPUTERS . ' '  AS A RESULT OF THE COMPETITION THE COMMISSION OFFERED THE APPLICANT ' ' THE POST OF SENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT ( PROGRAMMER ) ' '  IN DIRECTORATE-GENERAL IX ' ' AS A PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL IN GRADE B ' ' . THE APPLICANT ACCEPTED THE OFFER AND CONFIRMED THAT HE WOULD TAKE UP HIS EMPLOYMENT ON OCTOBER . THE DECISION APPOINTING THE APPLICANT , WHICH WAS ADOPTED ON OCTOBER , PLACED HIM AS A SENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT IN THE FIRST STEP OF GRADE B .    ON DECEMBER THE APPLICANT LODGED A COMPLAINT AGAINST THAT DECISION ALLEGING THAT IN VIEW OF HIS EXPERIENCE WITH THIRD-GENERATION COMPUTERS HE     OUGHT TO BE PLACED IN THE FIRST STEP OF GRADE B OR AT LEAST IN THE THIRD STEP OF GRADE B . THAT COMPLAINT WAS REJECTED BY A DECISION OF THE COMMISSION OF JUNE WHICH WAS FOUNDED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY APPOINTS EVERY SUCCESSFUL APPLICANT AS A PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL IN THE BASIC GRADE OF THE BASIC CAREER BRACKET OF HIS CATEGORY .   AT THE END OF HIS PROBATIONARY PERIOD THE APPLICANT BECAME AN ESTABLISHED OFFICIAL IN HIS POST WITH EFFECT FROM JULY .    ON DECEMBER THE APPLICANT LODGED A FURTHER COMPLAINT AND SOUGHT TO BE PLACED IN GRADE B . BY A LETTER DATED APRIL MR TUGENDHAT , A MEMBER OF THE COMMISSION , INFORMED THE APPLICANT THAT THE COMMISSION HAD REJECTED THE COMPLAINT ON THE GROUND THAT THE PLACING IN THE FIRST STEP OF GRADE B HAD BECOME UNASSAILABLE AFTER THE EXPIRY OF THE PERIOD FOR BRINGING AN ACTION PURSUANT TO THE REJECTION OF THE COMPLAINT MADE AGAINST THAT GRADING IN . FURTHER , THE CONTESTED GRADING WAS IN FACT JUSTIFIED IN VIEW OF THE NATURE OF THE COMPETITION ON THE BASIS OF WHICH THE APPLICANT HAD BEEN ENGAGED . THE PRESENT ACTION IS ESSENTIALLY DIRECTED AGAINST THAT DECISION TO REJECT THE COMPLAINT .   THE COMMISSION SUBMITS THAT THE ACTION WAS BROUGHT AFTER THE EXPIRY OF THE PERIOD LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND IS THEREFORE INADMISSIBLE .   THE APPLICANT , WHO MAINTAINS THAT THE DUTIES WHICH HE PERFORMS ARE THOSE OF A PROGRAMMER AND NOT OF A SENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT AND THAT THEY THEREFORE CORRESPOND TO A POST IN GRADE B , MAKES TWO SUBMISSIONS TO SHOW THAT HIS APPLICATION IS NOT TIME-BARRED . IN THE FIRST PLACE , THE PURPOSE OF THE COMPLAINT OF WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE PURPOSE OF THE COMPLAINT MADE IN WHICH SOUGHT ONLY A HIGHER GRADING IN THE SAME CAREER BRACKET ( B 3/B ); THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION REJECTING THE COMPLAINT OF SHOULD IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES NOT BE REGARDED AS BEING OF A CONFIRMATORY NATURE . SECONDLY , THE UNLAWFULNESS OF HIS BEING PLACED IN A GRADE OTHER THAN B BECAME APPARENT TO HIM ONLY IN OCTOBER AFTER HE RECEIVED THE ' ' GUIDE TO STAFF REPORTS ' '  COMPILED BY THE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE     STAFF REGULATIONS ; IT INCLUDED IN THE DESCRIPTIVE TABLE OF BASIC POSTS A REFERENCE TO ' ' PROGRAMMER ' '  IN THE COLUMN RELATING TO GRADE B AND A REFERENCE TO ' ' ASSISTANT PROGRAMMER ' '  IN THE COLUMN RELATING TO GRADES B AND B .    IT IS RELEVANT TO OBSERVE FIRST OF ALL THAT THE MEASURE ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE APPLICANT WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THE ACTION IS THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY ' S DECISION OF OCTOBER PLACING HIM IN GRADE B . SINCE THE COMMISSION REJECTED A COMPLAINT WHICH WAS LODGED AGAINST THAT DECISION WITHIN THE REQUISITE PERIOD IT WAS NOT REQUIRED , UNLESS IMPORTANT NEW FACTS AROSE , TO CONSIDER A FRESH COMPLAINT AGAINST THE SAME DECISION .   THE FIRST SUBMISSION MUST THEREFORE BE REJECTED AND IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE CIRCUMSTANCES CITED IN THE SECOND SUBMISSION MAY BE REGARDED AS A NEW ACT CAPABLE OF STARTING THE PERIOD OF LIMITATION TO RUN AFRESH .   THE COMMISSION OBSERVES IN THAT REGARD THAT THE DESCRIPTION OF DUTIES RELATING TO POSTS IN CATEGORY B GIVEN IN THE GUIDE TO STAFF REPORTS IS IDENTICAL TO THAT CONTAINED IN THE GUIDE TO STAFF REPORTS . THE LATTER WAS PUBLISHED IN THE STAFF COURIER ( NO OF SEPTEMBER ) AND WAS AVAILABLE TO ALL INTERESTED OFFICIALS AS FROM THE DATE OF ITS PUBLICATION .   THE APPLICANT DOES NOT DENY THAT THE DESCRIPTION OF THE BASIC POSTS HAD ALREADY BEEN PUBLISHED IN . HE POINTS OUT HOWEVER THAT AT THAT TIME HE HAD NOT YET TAKEN UP EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMMISSION . IN HIS VIEW HE WAS NOT BOUND TO CHECK THE CONTENT OF PUBLICATIONS , ISSUED PRIOR TO HIS TAKING UP EMPLOYMENT , WHICH MIGHT CONCERN HIM . IT IS FOR THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY TO SUPPLY OFFICIALS WITH ALL PUBLICATIONS RELATIVE TO THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THEIR DUTIES AND THEIR GRADE ; THE APPLICANT HOWEVER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE GUIDE TO STAFF REPORTS UNTIL HE RECEIVED A NOTE FROM THE COMMISSION DATED OCTOBER .        THE ESSENCE OF THE APPLICANT ' S ARGUMENT , THEREFORE , IS TO SUBMIT THAT THE FACT THAT THE EXISTENCE AND APPLICATION OF THE DESCRIPTION OF THE BASIC POSTS ANNEXED TO THE GUIDE TO STAFF REPORTS CAME TO HIS ATTENTION CONSTITUTES A NEW FACT CAPABLE OF STARTING THE PERIOD OF LIMITATION TO RUN AFRESH .   THAT ARGUMENT CANNOT BE ACCEPTED . THE PURPOSE OF THE GUIDE TO STAFF REPORTS IS TO PROVIDE GUIDE-LINES FOR SENIOR OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR PREPARING PERIODIC REPORTS PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS . IT IS PUBLISHED IN ORDER TO INFORM THE OFFICIALS CONCERNED OF THE CRITERIA APPLICABLE UNDER THAT PROCEDURE . ACCORDINGLY , THE DESCRIPTION OF THE BASIC POSTS WHICH IT CONTAINS DOES NOT ENTITLE THE STAFF TO DEMAND APPOINTMENT IN A GIVEN GRADE OR A FORTIORI TO REQUIRE , AFTER APPOINTMENT IN A GIVEN GRADE , A HIGHER GRADE OUTSIDE THE NORMAL PROMOTION PROCEDURE .   ACCORDINGLY , THE APPLICATION IS INADMISSIBLE IN SO FAR AS IT ASKS FOR THE APPLICANT TO BE PLACED IN GRADE B . IT FOLLOWS THAT THE APPLICATION FOR PAYMENT OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SALARY ACTUALLY RECEIVED AND THAT PAYABLE ON THE APPLICANT ' S RE-GRADING MUST FAIL .   THE ACTION MUST THEREFORE BE DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE IN ITS ENTIRETY .  
Decision on costs
ACCORDING TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS . HOWEVER , UNDER ARTICLE THEREOF THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE INSTITUTIONS IN ACTIONS BY SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES ARE TO BE BORNE BY THE INSTITUTIONS .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ( FIRST CHAMBER )   HEREBY :   . DISMISSES THE APPLICATION AS INADMISSIBLE ;  . ORDERS THE PARTIES TO BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .
