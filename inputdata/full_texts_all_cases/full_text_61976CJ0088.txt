THE APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON SEPTEMBER SEEKS THE ANNULMENT OF COMMISSION REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1579/OF JUNE LAYING DOWN SPECIAL DETAILED RULES OF APPLICATION FOR SUGAR UNDER REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 557/ON THE EXCHANGE RATES TO BE APPLIED IN AGRICULTURE ( OJ L , P . ) IN SO FAR AS IT ABOLISHES THE RIGHT OF CANCELLATION OF EXPORT LICENCES CERTIFYING THE REFUND FIXED UNDER THE AWARDS PROVIDED FOR BY REGULATION NO 2101/, ISSUED BEFORE MARCH AND NOT YET USED ON JULY ( ARTICLE ( )).   REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1134/OF THE COUNCIL OF JULY LAYING DOWN RULES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 653/ON CONDITIONS FOR ALTERATIONS TO THE VALUE OF THE UNIT OF ACCOUNT USED FOR THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY ( OJ , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION , ( II ), P . ) PROVIDES IN ARTICLE ( ) THAT IN THE CASE OF ALTERATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARITY OF THE CURRENCY OF A MEMBER STATE AND THE VALUE OF THE UNIT OF ACCOUNT , THE AMOUNTS WHICH HAVE BEEN FIXED IN ADVANCE FOR A TRANSACTION STILL TO BE CARRIED OUT AFTER THAT ALTERATION ARE TO BE ADJUSTED .   IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE CHANGE IN THE AMOUNTS REFERRED TO FROM CAUSING DISADVANTAGE TO THE PERSONS CONCERNED THE LAST SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) ADDS HOWEVER THAT A PERSON WHO HAS OBTAINED ADVANCE FIXING FOR A SPECIFIC TRANSACTION MAY , BY APPLICATION , OBTAIN CANCELLATION OF THE ADVANCE FIXING AND OF THE RELEVANT DOCUMENT OR CERTIFICATE .   ARTICLE ( ) OF COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 557/OF MARCH ON THE EXCHANGE RATE TO BE APPLIED IN AGRICULTURE ( OJ L , P . ) WHICH FIXED THE RATES OF EXCHANGE VALID FOR MARKETING YEARS COMMENCING IN THE COURSE OF STATED THAT THE PROVISIONS OF REGULATION NO 1134/WERE APPLICABLE WHILE STIPULATING HOWEVER IN ARTICLE ( ) THAT THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) REFERRED TO ABOVE PROVIDING FOR THE RIGHT OF CANCELLATION ' SHALL APPLY ONLY IF THE APPLICATION OF THE NEW REPRESENTATIVE RATES IS DISADVANTAGEOUS FOR THE PARTY CONCERNED ' .   THE ABOVEMENTIONED ARTICLE ( ) WAS FURTHER AMENDED BY COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1451/OF JUNE ( OJ L , P . ) WHICH STATED IN THE PREAMBLE THAT ' WHEREAS IF THIS RIGHT ( OF CANCELLATION ) WERE WIDELY EXERCISED , IT COULD IN CERTAIN CASES SERIOUSLY HINDER GOOD COMMUNITY ADMINISTRATION OF A GIVEN AGRICULTURAL MARKET '  ADDED THE FOLLOWING SUBPARAGRAPH TO THE SAID ARTICLE ( ): ' PROVISION MAY BE MADE FOR THIS DISADVANTAGE TO THE COMPENSATED FOR BY A SUITABLE MEASURE . IN SUCH A CASE , THE PROVISION REFERRED TO IN THE FIRST SUBPARAGRAPH SHALL NOT APPLY ' .   BY VIRTUE OF THIS LATTER PROVISION THE COMMISSION ADOPTED THE REGULATION AT ISSUE , STATING IN THE PREAMBLE THERETO THAT : ' WHEREAS IN THE SUGAR SECTOR LARGE SCALE RECOURSE TO THE RIGHT TO CANCEL EXPORT LICENCES ISSUED IN CONNEXION WITH PARTIAL AWARDS UNDER COMMISSION REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2101/OF AUGUST ON A STANDING INVITATION TO TENDER IN ORDER TO DETERMINE A LEVY AND/OR REFUND ON EXPORTS OF WHITE SUGAR , AS LAST AMENDED BY REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1406/, COULD SERIOUSLY DISTURB THE COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT OF THE SECTOR ; WHEREAS IN ORDER TO AVOID SUCH A RISK PROVISION MUST BE MADE FOR THE RIGHT OF CANCELLATION NOT TO APPLY , FOR APPROPRIATE COMPENSATION FOR THE RESULTING DISADVANTAGE AND FOR THE TERMS UNDER WHICH SUCH COMPENSATION SHALL BE GRANTED ' .   ARTICLE OF THAT REGULATION PROVIDES THAT :    ' . THE COMPENSATION REFERRED TO IN THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 557/SHALL BE GRANTED FOR THOSE QUANTITIES OF WHITE SUGAR FOR WHICH CUSTOMS EXPORT FORMALITIES ARE COMPLETED ON OR AFTER JULY IN CONNEXION WITH PARTIAL AWARDS UNDER REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2101/AND FOR WHICH AN EXPORT LICENCE WAS ISSUED BEFORE MARCH . FOR THE MEMBER STATES CONCERNED THIS COMPENSATION SHALL BE AS SHOWN IN THE ANNEX .   . IN RESPECT OF THE EXPORT LICENCES REFERRED TO IN PARAGRAPH , THE RIGHT TO CANCEL UNDER THE LAST SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1134/MAY NOT BE EXERCISED . '  ADMISSIBILITY   THE APPLICANT ARGUES THAT IT IS DIRECTLY AND INDIVIDUALLY CONCERNED BY THE DECISION WHICH IS CONTAINED IN THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED ARTICLE AND THEREFORE THAT HIS ACTION IS ADMISSIBLE UNDER ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .   ON THE ONE HAND , BY REFERRING TO A CLEARLY DEFINED CATEGORY OF EXPORT LICENCES , NAMELY THOSE ISSUED BEFORE MARCH AND STILL VALID ON JULY , THE PROVISION AT ISSUE THEREFORE DIRECTLY CONCERNS TRADERS HOLDING SUCH LICENCES .   ON THE OTHER , THE TRADERS ARE DISTINGUISHED INDIVIDUALLY BY THE FACT THAT THEY OBTAINED , FOR THE PRODUCT IN QUESTION , ADVANCE FIXING IN LICENCES ISSUED BEFORE MARCH AND STILL VALID ON JULY .    THE PROVISION THEREFORE CONCERNS NATURAL OR LEGAL PERSONS AFFECTED BY REASON OF CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THEY ARE DIFFERENTIATED FROM ALL OTHER PERSONS AND DISTINGUISHED INDIVIDUALLY JUST AS IN THE CASE OF THE PERSON ADDRESSED .   CONSEQUENTLY THE ACTION IS ADMISSIBLE IN THIS RESPECT .   HOWEVER BEFORE DECIDING ON THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CASE IT IS NECESSARY TO EXAMINE WHETHER THE REGULATION AT ISSUE IS APPLICABLE TO THE SITUATION OF THE APPLICANT .   INDEED IN THE ALTERNATIVE THE APPLICANT HAS ARGUED THAT THE REGULATION IS NOT APPLICABLE TO IT ON THE GROUND THAT ALTHOUGH IT WAS PUBLISHED IN AN ISSUE OF THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL DATED JULY THE ISSUE WAS ONLY DISTRIBUTED ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AND THAT THE REGULATION CANNOT HAVE A RETROACTIVE EFFECT .   THE COMMISSION ADMITS THAT THIS ISSUE OF THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL WAS ONLY PUBLISHED AND DISTRIBUTED THE FOLLOWING DAY BECAUSE OF A STRIKE .   IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT ARTICLE OF THE REGULATION PROVIDES THAT IT SHALL ENTER INTO FORCE ON JULY THE REGULATION COULD ONLY PROPERLY BE APPLIED ON THE FOLLOWING DAY .   WHILE COMMUNITY LAW DOES NOT EXCLUDE ALL POSSIBILITY OF RETROACTIVE EFFECTS THE REGULATION AT ISSUE CONTAINS NO FACTOR CAPABLE OF ATTRIBUTING TO IT EFFECTS BEFORE THE DAY OF ITS ACTUAL PUBLICATION .   CONSEQUENTLY IT CANNOT BE APPLIED TO THE APPLICATIONS FOR THE CANCELLATION OF LICENCES LODGED BY THE APPLICANT ON JULY .    IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES , IN VIEW OF THE LACK OF LEGAL INTEREST OF THE APPLICANT , THE ACTION IS INADMISSIBLE .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY SHALL BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .   HOWEVER ARTICLE ( ) PROVIDES THAT THE COURT MAY ORDER EVEN A SUCCESSFUL PARTY TO PAY COSTS WHICH IT CAUSED THE OTHER PARTY TO INCUR .   THROUGHOUT THE PROCEEDINGS THE COMMISSION BASED ITS ARGUMENT ON THE EXPRESS PRESUMPTION THAT REGULATION NO 1579/WAS INDEED APPLICABLE TO THE SITUATION OF THE APPLICANT AND THEREFORE ARTICLE ( ) SHOULD BE APPLIED IN THE PRESENT CASE AS IT HAS APPEARED THAT THAT PRESUMPTION WAS WITHOUT FOUNDATION .   CONSEQUENTLY THE DEFENDANT SHOULD BE ORDERED TO BEAR THE COSTS OF THE CASE INCLUDING THOSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES .
