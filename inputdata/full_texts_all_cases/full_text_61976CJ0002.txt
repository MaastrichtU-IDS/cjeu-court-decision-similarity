Summary
THE INSTITUTIONS ENJOY A VERY EXTENSIVE POWER OF APPRAISAL WITH REGARD TO THE VALIDITY OF THE REASONS ADVANCED BY THE OFFICIAL OR SERVANT WISHING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF LEAVE ON PERSONAL GROUNDS AND TO THE COMPATIBILITY OF THE GRANT OF LEAVE WITH THE INTERESTS OF THE SERVICE . ALTHOUGH THE PRACTICE OF THE INSTITUTIONS INDICATES A WIDE RANGE OF REASONS FOR GARANTING LEAVE ON PERSONAL GROUNDS , IT SEEMS CERTAIN THAT SUCH LEAVE IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE MEANS OF DEALING WITH THE CASE OF AN OFFICIAL AGAINST WHOM CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN INSTITUTED .

Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION OF AUGUST BY WHICH LEAVE ON PERSONAL GROUNDS WAS REFUSED , 
Grounds
THE APPLICATION IS FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION OF AUGUST REFUSING TO GRANT THE APPLICANT LEAVE ON PERSONAL GROUNDS .   IT IS COMMON GROUND BETWEEN THE PARTIES THAT THE APPLICANT , WHO IS AN ITALIAN NATIONAL EMPLOYED AS A PRINCIPAL SECRETARY AT THE JOINT NUCLEAR RESEARCH CENTRE AT ISPRA , VARESE , DID NOT CARRY OUT HER DUTIES AS FROM NOVEMBER AND DID NOT PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION FOR THIS AT THE TIME .  BY A LETTER OF JANUARY THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CENTRE AT ISPRA NOTIFIED HER OF A DECISION WHEREBY , UNDER ARTICLE OF THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OTHER SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES ( ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS ) IT HAD SUSPENDED PAYMENT OF HER SALARY SINCE THE DURATION OF HER UNJUSTIFIED ABSENCE HAD EXCEEDED THE ANNUAL LEAVE TO WHICH SHE WAS ENTITLED .   BY A LETTER OF JANUARY ETTORE MACCAPANI , AN ADVOCATE OF THE VARESE BAR , FORWARDED TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CENTRE AT ISPRA AN APPLICATION , DATED DECEMBER , WHEREBY THE APPLICANT SUBMITTED A REQUEST UNDER ARTICLE OF THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OTHER SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES ( ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS ) FOR UNPAID LEAVE OF ONE YEAR ON PERSONAL GROUNDS .  THIS REQUEST WAS BASED ON ' REASONS OF FORCE MAJEURE , THAT IS COURT PROCEEDINGS INSTITUTED AGAINST HER IN CONNEXION WITH AN OFFENCE ' OF A POLITICAL NATURE '  WHICH MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO COME TO WORK .  IN THIS CONNEXION IT WAS EXPLAINED IN THE COURSE OF THE PROCEDURE THAT ON DECEMBER THE EXAMINING JUDGE OF THE TRIBUNALE DI ROMA HAD ISSUED A WARRANT FOR THE ARREST OF THE APPLICANT BECAUSE OF HER PARTICIPATION IN A POLITICAL CONSPIRACY AND ARMED REBELLION AGAINST THE STATE .   BY A LETTER OF FEBRUARY THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRE AT ISPRA NOTIFIED THE APPLICANT THAT HE COULD NOT GRANT HER REQUEST SINCE THE GROUND UPON WHICH SHE RELIED PROVIDED NO JUSTIFICATION WHATEVER FOR THE GRANT OF LEAVE ON PERSONAL GROUNDS .  BY A LETTER OF MARCH RECORDED ON APRIL THE APPLICANT , THROUGH HER LAWYER , LODGED A COMPLAINT AGAINST THIS DECISION WITH THE COMMISSION , UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  BY A LETTER OF OCTOBER THE COMMISSION NOTIFIED THE APPLICANT OF ITS DECISION OF AUGUST WHEREBY IT CONFIRMED THE DECISION OF REFUSAL PREVIOUSLY TAKEN BY THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CENTRE AT ISPRA AND STATED THAT IT AGREED WITH THE REASONS STATED IN THE LATTER DECISION .  THAT DECISION OF REFUSAL CONSTITUTES THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF THE APPLICATION .   UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , WHICH APPLIES TO THE APPLICANT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OTHER SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES , ' AN OFFICIAL MAY , IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND AT HIS OWN REQUEST , BE GRANTED UNPAID LEAVE ON PERSONAL GROUNDS ' .  ALTHOUGH THIS POWER WAS CREATED IN THE INTEREST OF THE PERSONAL CONVENIENCE OF OFFICIALS AND SERVANTS IT IS NONE THE LESS TRUE THAT THE INSTITUTIONS ENJOY A VERY EXTENSIVE POWER OF APPRAISAL WITH REGARD BOTH TO THE VALIDITY OF THE REASONS ADVANCED BY THE OFFICIAL OR SERVANT WISHING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT OPPORTUNITY AND TO THE COMPATIBILITY OF THE GRANT OF LEAVE WITH THE INTERESTS OF THE SERVICE .   ALTHOUGH THE PRACTICE OF THE INSTITUTIONS INDICATES A WIDE RANGE OF REASONS FOR GRANTING LEAVE ON PERSONAL GROUNDS , SUCH AS FAMILY REASONS , THE PURSUIT OF FURTHER EDUCATION OR TRAINING OR THE RESUMPTION OF OTHER OCCUPATIONS , IT SEEMS CERTAIN THAT LEAVE ON PERSONAL GROUNDS IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE MEANS OF DEALING WITH THE CASE OF AN OFFICIAL AGAINST WHOM CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN INSTITUTED .  IT THUS APPEARS THAT THE COMMISSION HAS CORRECTLY EXERCISED IN RELATION TO THE APPLICANT THE POWER OF APPRAISAL RESERVED TO IT BY ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS WITH REGARD TO LEAVE GRANTED ON PERSONAL GROUNDS .  THE APPLICATION MUST THEREFORE BE DISMISSED .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY MUST BE ORDERED TO BEAR THE COSTS .  THE APPLICANT HAS FAILED IN HER SUBMISSIONS .  NEVERTHELESS , UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE , IN PROCEEDINGS COMMENCED BY AN OFFICIAL OR OTHER SERVANT , INSTITUTIONS SHALL BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ( SECOND CHAMBER )   HEREBY :   . DISMISSES THE APPLICATION ;  . ORDERS EACH PARTY TO BEAR ITS OWN COSTS .
