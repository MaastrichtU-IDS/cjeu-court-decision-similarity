Re: 
Appeal brought against the judgment of the President of the General Court (First Chamber) of March in Case T-15/Mariyus Noko Ngele 
v 
Commission and Others 
by which that court dismissed the application seeking compensation for the material damage allegedly suffered by the applicant
                  by reason of the fact that it was impossible for him to proceed with recovery of a debt and for the non-pecuniary loss allegedly
                  suffered by reason of the institution of criminal proceedings against him in a Member State – Lack of causal link. 
               
Operative part 
1.
	The appeal is dismissed. 
2.
	Noko Ngele is ordered to bear his own costs.
