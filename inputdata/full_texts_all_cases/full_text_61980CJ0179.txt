Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON AUGUST , ROQUETTE FRERES , A COMPANY INCORPORATED UNDER FRENCH LAW , INSTITUTED PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1592/OF JUNE ON THE APPLICATION OF THE SYSTEM OF PRODUCTION QUOTAS IN THE SUGAR AND ISOGLUCOSE SECTORS DURING THE PERIOD JULY TO JUNE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) WAS PARTIALLY VOID . MORE PRECISELY , THE APPLICANT     ASKED THE COURT TO DECLARE INVALID ARTICLE OF THE SAID REGULATION AS WELL AS ANNEX II THERETO . ARTICLE ( ) EXTENDS THE VALIDITY OF THE SYSTEM OF PRODUCTION QUOTAS FOR ISOGLUCOSE WHICH WAS INCORPORATED , FOR THE PERIOD BETWEN JULY AND JUNE , IN COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1111/OF MAY LAYING DOWN COMMON PROVISIONS FOR ISOGLUCOSE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ) BY REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1293/OF JUNE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , , P . , AS RECTIFIED BY A CORRIGENDUM IN OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ). UNDER ARTICLE ( ), THE BASIC QUOTA FOR EACH ISOGLUCOSE PRODUCING ENTERPRISE FOR THE PERIOD FROM JULY TO JUNE WAS TO BE THAT APPLICABLE DURING THE PERIOD FROM JULY TO JUNE .  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT COUNCIL REGULATION NO 1592/WAS ADOPTED WHILE THE PROCEEDINGS WERE PENDING WHICH LED TO THE COURT ' S DECLARATION , IN ITS JUDGMENTS OF OCTOBER IN CASE 138/ROQUETTE V COUNCIL ( ) ECR AND IN CASE 139/MAIZENA V COUNCIL ( ) ECR , THAT REGULATION NO 1293/WAS VOID ON THE GROUND THAT IT HAD BEEN ADOPTED WITHOUT THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ' S BEING CONSULTED , AS REQUIRED BY ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY . IN ITS DECISION IN THE AFORESAID CASES , HOWEVER , THE COURT REJECTED ALL THE SUBSTANTIVE ARGUMENTS DIRECTED AGAINST THE SYSTEM OF PRODUCTION QUOTAS ESTABLISHED FOR ISOGLUCOSE BY THE SAID REGULATION AND , IN PARTICULAR , AGAINST THE FIXING OF BASIC QUOTAS FOR THE APPLICANTS IN BOTH CASES .   IN ITS APPLICATION , THE APPLICANT CONTENDS THAT THE COUNCIL ADOPTED REGULATION NO 1592/WITHOUT AWAITING THE PARLIAMENT ' S OPINION . AS REGARDS THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CASE , THE APPLICANT MERELY RESTATES THE ARGUMENTS WHICH IT PUT FORWARD IN CASE 138/AND WHICH WERE REJECTED BY THE COURT IN ITS AFOREMENTIONED JUGDMENT IN THAT CASE . IN ITS REPLY , IT ALSO CONTENDS THAT REGULATION NO 1592/, IN SO FAR AS IT MERELY EXTENDS THE VALIDITY OF REGULATION NO 1293/, IS VOID FOR THE SAME REASONS AS THE LATTER . THE UNLAWFULNESS OF REGULATION NO 1592/IS , IT MAINTAINS , A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE OF THE COURT ' S FINDING IN ITS ABOVE-MENTIONED JUGDMENT THAT REGULATION NO 1293/WAS UNLAWFUL . FINALLY , IT STATES THAT IT NO LONGER RELIES ON THE SUBSTANTIVE ARGUMENTS WHICH IT PUT FORWARD IN ITS APPLICATION .   IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT ON FEBRUARY , WHILE THIS CASE WAS PENDING BEFORE THE COURT , THE COUNCIL , AFTER OBTAINING THE PARLIAMENT ' S OPINION ON FEBRUARY , ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING TWO REGULATIONS :       ( A ) REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 387/AMENDING REGULATION NO 1111/LAYING DOWN COMMON PROVISIONS FOR ISOGLUCOSE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ). REGULATION NO 387/REINTRODUCES , BY REFERRING TO THE PROVISIONS OF REGULATION NO 1111/, INTER ALIA THE SYSTEM OF PRODUCTION QUOTAS WITH RETROACTIVE EFFECT FROM JULY .    ( B)REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 388/AMENDING REGULATION NO 1592/( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ). REGULATION NO 388/, ACCORDING TO THE SECOND RECTIAL IN THE PREAMBLE THERETO , WAS ADOPTED ' ' IN ORDER TO AVOID ANY DOUBTS AS TO THE LEGALITY . . . OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1592/' ' . WITH THAT END IN VIEW , ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 388/PROVIDES THAT ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1592/IS TO REFER TO ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1111/, AS AMENDED BY REGULATION NO 387/. REGULATION NO 388/, ACCORDING TO ARTICLE THEREOF , IS TO APPLY FROM JULY .     IN ITS REJOINDER , THE COUNCIL RAISED A FRESH ISSUE , WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE , BY CONTENDING THAT THE ACTION HAS BECOME POINTLESS AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE TWO AFORESAID REGULATIONS . THE COUNCIL CONSIDERS , MOREOVER , THAT THE APPLICANT NO LONGER HAS ANY INTEREST IN PROCEEDING WITH ITS APPLICATION AND THAT TO DO SO MAY BE REGARDED AS AN ABUSE OF PROCESS .   IN AN ADDITIONAL STATEMENT SUBMITTED IN REPLY TO THE FRESH ISSUE RAISED BY THE COUNCIL , THE APPLICANT POINTS OUT THAT IT HAS NO INTENTION OF WITHDRAWING ITS APPLICATION BUT LEAVES TO THE COURT THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT IT IS NECESSARY TO GIVE A DECISION ON THE POINT AT ISSUE .   WHILST PROCEEDING WITH ITS ACTION IN THIS CASE , THE APPLICANT INSTITUTED PROCEEDINGS , BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON MAY , FOR A DECLARATION THAT COUNCIL REGULATIONS NOS AND 388/WERE VOID . BY JUDGMENT OF SEPTEMBER , THE COURT DISMISSED THAT APPLICATION AS UNFOUNDED .   IN THE LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS , IT MUST BE STATED THAT A DECLARATION THAT REGULATION NO 1592/IS VOID IS NO LONGER OF ANY INTEREST TO THE APPLICANT IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE PROVISIONS WHICH IT SEEKS TO HAVE DECLARED VOID HAVE , IN THE MEANTIME , BEEN CONFIRMED BY A REGULATION AGAINST     WHICH AN APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION OF NULLITY BROUGHT BY THE APPLICANT WAS DISMISSED BY THE COURT AS UNFOUNDED IN ITS AFOREMENTIONED JUDGMENT .   CONSEQUENTLY , IT IS UNNECESSARY FOR THE COURT TO GIVE A DECISION ON THE POINT AT ISSUE .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE , WHERE A CASE DOES NOT PROCEED TO JUDGMENT , THE COSTS SHALL BE IN THE DISCRETION OF THE COURT .   IF THE APPLICANT HAD WITHDRAWN ITS APPLICATION AFTER IT BECAME AWARE OF THE AMENDMENT MADE TO THE CONTESTED REGULATION BY THE TWO REGULATIONS OF FEBRUARY , THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN GROUNDS FOR FINDING THAT ITS WITHDRAWAL WAS JUSTIFIED BY THE ATTITUDE OF THE COUNCIL AND FOR ORDERING THE LATTER TO PAY THE COSTS .   HOWEVER , IT IS CLEAR FROM THE COURT ' S JUDGMENT IN CASE 110/THAT THE UNLAWFULNESS RELIED UPON BY THE APPLICANT IN SUPPORT OF THIS APPLICATION , EVEN ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED , WAS REMEDIED BY THE ADOPTION OF REGULATION NO 388/AND THAT THEREAFTER THE APPLICANT NO LONGER HAD ANY INTEREST IN THE PROSECUTION OF THE ACTION .   IN THE LIGHT OF ALL THOSE CONSIDERATIONS , IT IS EQUITABLE FOR THE PARTIES TO BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT  HEREBY :   . DECLARES THAT IT IS UNNECESSARY FOR IT TO GIVE A DECISION ON THE POINT AT ISSUE ;      2.ORDERS THE PARTIES TO BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .
