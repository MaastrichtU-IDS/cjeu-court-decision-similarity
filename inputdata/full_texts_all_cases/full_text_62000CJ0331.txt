Case C-331/Hellenic RepublicvCommission of the European Communities
«(EAGGF – Clearance of accounts – Financial years 1996, and – Arable crops – Beef – Aid for early retirement)»
Opinion of Advocate General Tizzano delivered on February Judgment of the Court (Fifth Chamber), September Summary of the Judgment
1..
Agriculture – EAGGF – Clearance of accounts – Power of Commission to review validity of expenditure – Where reasonable doubt arises – Burden of proof on the Member State   
2..
Agriculture – Common organisation of the markets – Beef and veal – Additional premium in order to deal with the bovine spongiform encephalopathy crisis – Definition of execution of payments(Council Regulation No 1357/96, Art. 7; Commission Regulation No 1663/95)
1.
 Although the Commission is required to justify its decision to refuse to charge expenditure effected by a Member State to
         the EAGGF Guarantee section by providing evidence of serious reasonable doubt as to the existence or appropriateness of checks
         carried out in that Member State, it is nevertheless not obliged to provide details of the inadequacy of those checks or the
         inaccuracy of the data provided by the Member State. It is the latter which is best placed to collect and verify the data
         required and to provide proof concerning the genuineness of the checks and the inaccuracy of the Commission's claims.  see para. 2.
 Article of Regulation No 1357/96, providing for additional payments to be made in in relation to the premiums referred
         to in Regulation No 805/on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal and amending that regulation, explicitly
         provides that expenses incurred by Member States under Articles and 4(a) of the Regulation, that is to say, special payments
         in addition to the premiums due in respect of animals eligible in the calendar year, are financed by the Community only
         if they take place ‘by October at the latest’. That provision therefore assumes that the data necessary for payment
         of the aid must to a very large extent be already available before that date. In that regard, paragraphs 2(ii) and 6(v) of
         the Annex to Regulation No 1663/laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation No 729/regarding the procedure
         for the clearance of the accounts of the EAGGF Guarantee Section, define the execution of payments as the issuing of an instruction
         to a bank or a governmental payments office to pay the amount which is due to the recipient, which requires a direct payment
         to the latter.   see paras 95-JUDGMENT OF THE COURT (Fifth Chamber)September (1)

after hearing the Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting on February 2003,
gives the following
Judgment
            
 By application lodged at the Court Registry on September 2000, the Hellenic Republic brought an action under the first
         paragraph of Article EC for the partial annulment of Commission Decision 2000/449/EC of July excluding from Community
         financing certain expenditure incurred by the Member States under the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance
         and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) (OJ L 180, p. 49) (hereinafter  
         the contested decision), in so far as it lays down financial corrections at the expense of the Hellenic Republic for the financial years 1996, and 1998. 
         
Legal framework
 Community legislation
          Financing of expenditure under EAGGF
         
            
 Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/of April on the financing of the common agricultural policy (OJ L 94, p. 13),
         as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1287/of May (OJ L 125, p. 1, hereinafter  
         Regulation No 729/70), provides in Articles 1(2)(b) and 3(1) that the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund
         (EAGGF) is to finance interventions intended to stabilise the agricultural markets, undertaken according to Community rules
         within the framework of the common organisation of agricultural markets. 
         
            
 Article 1(4) of Regulation No 729/states: Expenditure relating to administrative costs and personnel borne by Member States and by recipients of aid from the Fund shall
         not be taken over by the Fund.
         
            
 Under Article 5(2)(c) of Regulation No 729/70: The Commission, after consulting the Fund Committee:...
         
(c)
 shall decide on the expenditure to be excluded from the Community financing referred to in Articles and where it finds
         that expenditure has not been effected in compliance with Community rules. Before a decision to refuse financing is taken, the results of the Commission's checks and the replies of the Member State
         concerned shall be notified in writing, after which the two parties shall endeavour to reach agreement on the action to be
         taken. If no agreement is reached, the Member State may ask for a procedure to be initiated with a view to mediating between the
         respective positions within a period of four months, the results of which shall be set out in a report sent to and examined
         by the Commission, before a decision to refuse financing is taken. The Commission shall evaluate the amounts to be excluded having regard in particular to the degree of non-compliance found.
         The Commission shall take into account the nature and gravity of the infringement and the financial loss suffered by the Community.
         
         ...
         
            
 Commission Regulation (EC) No 1663/of July laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation
         (EEC) No 729/regarding the procedure for the clearance of the accounts of the EAGGF Guarantee Section (OJ L 158, p.
         6), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2245/of October (OJ L 273, p. 5) (hereinafter  
         Regulation No 1663/95) sets out, among other things, the obligations of coordinating bodies which are the sole representatives of the Member State
         before the Commission. Those bodies must hold at the disposal of the Commission a full record of all requisite accounting
         information in a form which allows the Commission to carry out the necessary checks. 
         
            
 Article 8(1) and (2) of Regulation No 1663/states: 
         
1.
 If, as a result of an enquiry, the Commission considers that expenditure has not been effected according to Community rules,
         it shall notify the Member State concerned of the results of its checks and indicate the corrective measures to be taken to
         ensure future compliance.
         ... The Member State shall reply within two months and the Commission may modify its position in consequence. ...After expiry of the period allowed for reply, the Commission shall invite the Member State to a bilateral discussion and the
         parties shall endeavour to reach agreement on the measures to be taken and on an evaluation of the gravity of the infringement
         and the financial loss to the Community. ... [The Commission] shall formally communicate its conclusions to the Member State,
         referring to Commission Decision 94/442/EC ... [T]hat communication shall include an evaluation of any expenditure the Commission
         intends to exclude under Article 5(2)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70.The Member State shall inform the Commission as soon as possible of the corrective measures adopted to ensure compliance with
         Community rules and the date of their entry into force. ...
         
2.
 The decisions referred to in Article 5(2)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 729/shall be taken after an examination of any report
         drawn up by the conciliation body according to the provisions laid down in [Decision] 94/442/EC.
         
            
 The Annex to Regulation No 1663/provides the administrative and accounting rules which must be complied with by Member
         State paying agencies in order to provide assurance that the eligibility of claims has been efficiently checked and that the
         corresponding payments comply with Community rules. 
         
            
 In accordance with paragraph 2(ii) of that annex, the paying agency performs, in respect of EAGGF-Guarantee expenditure, the
         function of executing payments, which is to issue instructions to the agency's bankers or, in appropriate cases, a governmental
         payments office, to pay the authorised amount to the claimant or his assignee. 
         
            
 Paragraph of the Annex to Regulation No 1663/sets the procedures with which the paying agency must comply in order to
         ensure the effectiveness of checks. In particular, paragraph 6(v) states: Procedures should ensure that payment is made only to the claimant, to his bank account or to his assignee. The payment shall
         be executed by the agency's banker, or, as appropriate, a governmental payments office, or the cheque mailed, within five
         working days of the date of charge to the EAGGF. Procedures shall be adopted to ensure that all payments for which transfers
         are not executed, or cheques not cashed, are recredited to the Fund. No payments shall be made in cash. The approval of the
         authorising official and/or his supervisor may be made by electronic means, provided an appropriate level of security over
         these means is ensured, and the identity of the signatory is entered in the electronic records.
         
            
 Article 4(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 296/of February on data to be forwarded by the Member States and
         the monthly booking of expenditure financed under the Guarantee Section of the Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)
         and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2776/(OJ L 39, p. provides that monthly advances against booking are to be reduced
         for expenditure effected by a Member State after the deadlines laid down by Community law according to the rules which it
         sets out. That provision is worded as follows:  Advances against booking shall be reduced for expenditure effected after the deadlines laid down as follows:
         
(a)
 where expenditure effected after the deadlines is equal to 4% or less of the expenditure effected before the deadlines, no
         reduction shall be made, irrespective of the number of months delay, 
         
(b)
 above the threshold of 4%, all further expenditure effected with a delay of up to: 
         
─
 one month shall be reduced by 10%, 
               
 one month shall be reduced by 10%, 
         
─
 two months shall be reduced by 25%, 
               
 two months shall be reduced by 25%, 
         
─
 three months shall be reduced by 45%, 
               
 three months shall be reduced by 45%, 
         
─
 four months shall be reduced by 70%, 
               
 four months shall be reduced by 70%, 
         
─
 five months or more shall be reduced by 100%. 
               
 five months or more shall be reduced by 100%. 
         
 However, the Commission will apply a different time scale and/or lower reductions or none at all, if exceptional management
         conditions are encountered for certain measures, or if well-founded justifications are introduced by the Member States.The reductions referred to in this article shall be made in accordance with the rules laid down in Article of Decision
         94/729/EC.
         
            
 Pursuant to the third subparagraph of Article 4(2) of Regulation No 296/and Article of Council Decision 94/729/EC of
         October on budgetary discipline (OJ L 293, p. 14), reduction of the monthly advances as the result of late payments
         by the Member States is decided by the Commission following a procedure  
         inter partes in the presence of the Member State concerned. 
         
            
 Under Article 4(4) of Regulation No 296/96: Any reductions made pursuant to Article of Decision 94/729/EC and particularly those resulting from overruns of deadlines
         shall be made without prejudice to the subsequent accounts clearance decision.
          Conciliation body
         
            
 Article 1(1) of Commission Decision 94/442/EC of July setting up a conciliation procedure in the context of the clearance
         of the accounts of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) Guarantee Section (OJ L 182, p. 45)
         states: For the purposes of the clearance of EAGGF Guarantee Section accounts, a Conciliation Body, hereinafter referred to as the
          
         Body, is hereby set up in the Commission. Its tasks shall be:
         
(a)
 to examine any matter referred to it by a Member State which, following inspections pursuant to Article of Regulation (EEC)
         No 729/and bilateral discussion of the findings of such inspections, receives formal notification from the competent Commission
         departments, with reference to this Decision, of the conclusion that certain items of expenditure incurred by that Member
         State are not chargeable to the EAGGF Guarantee Section, 
         
(b)
 to try to reconcile the divergent positions of the Commission and the Member State concerned, and
         
(c)
 at the end of its investigations, to draw up a report on the outcome of its efforts at reconciliation, making any remarks
         it deems useful should all or some of the points of dispute remain unresolved.
         
            
 Under Article 1(2)(a) of the Decision,  
         the position of the Body shall be without prejudice to the Commission's final decision on the clearance of the accounts. 
          Flat-rate corrections
         
            
 Commission working Document VI/216/of June 1993, and Commission Document VI/5330/of October which replaced
         it, sets out the guidelines which the institution intends to follow when applying financial corrections in the context of
         the clearance of EAGGF Guarantee accounts. According to those guidelines, when the actual amounts of irregular payments cannot
         be established and it is therefore not possible to quantify the financial loss suffered by the Community, the Commission applies
         flat-rate financial corrections amounting, in general, to 2%, 5%, 10% or 25% of the declared expenditure, depending on the
         extent of the risk of loss. The 25% rate is applicable where implementation of the checking system has been non-existent or
         seriously inadequate and there are indications of very frequent irregularities and negligence in combating irregular or fraudulent
         practices. 
         
            
 As is apparent from Document VI/5330/97, those guidelines distinguish between two categories of checks: 
         
─
 Key controls are those physical and administrative checks required to verify substantive elements, in particular the existence
            of the subject of the claim, the quantity, and the qualitative conditions including the respect of time-limits, harvesting
            requirements, retention periods, etc. They are performed on-the-spot, and by cross-checks to independent data such as land
            registers.

         of the subject of the claim, the quantity, and the qualitative conditions including the respect of time-limits, harvesting
         requirements, retention periods, etc. They are performed on-the-spot, and by cross-checks to independent data such as land
         registers. 
         
─
 Ancillary controls are those administrative operations required to correctly process claims, such as verification of the respect
            of time-limits for their submission, identification of duplicate claims for the same subject, risk analysis, application of
            sanctions and appropriate supervision of the procedures.
          Ancillary controls are those administrative operations required to correctly process claims, such as verification of the respect
         of time-limits for their submission, identification of duplicate claims for the same subject, risk analysis, application of
         sanctions and appropriate supervision of the procedures.
         
            
 Document VI/5330/makes clear that: When one or more key controls are not applied or applied so poorly or so infrequently that they are completely ineffective
         in determining the eligibility of the claim or preventing irregularity, then a correction of 10% is justified, as it can reasonably
         be concluded that there was a high risk of wide-spread loss to the Fund.When all key controls are applied, but not in the number, frequency or depth required by the regulations, then a correction
         of 5% is justified, as it can reasonably be concluded they do not provide sufficient level of assurance of the regularity
         of claims, and that the risk to the Fund was significant.When a Member State has adequately performed the key controls, but completely failed to operate one or more ancillary controls,
         then a correction of 2% is justified in view of the lower risk of loss to the Fund, and in view of the lesser seriousness
         of the infringement.
         
            
 Council Regulation (EEC) No 3508/of November establishing an integrated administration and control system for certain
         Community aid schemes (OJ L 355, p. 1), adopted as part of the reform of the common agricultural policy and direct subsidies
         to producers, provides that each Member State is to set up an integrated administration and control system (hereinafter  
         IACS) which applies,  
         inter alia, to the support systems established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1765/of June establishing a support system
         for producers of certain arable crops (OJ L 181, p. 12) and Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/of June on the
         common organisation of the market in beef and veal (OJ L 148, p. 24). 
         
            
 Article of Regulation No 3508/states: The integrated system shall comprise the following elements:
         
(a)
 a computerised database; 
         
(b)
 an alphanumeric identification system for agricultural parcels; 
         
(c)
 an alphanumeric system for the identification and registration of animals; 
         
(d)
 aid applications; 
         
(e)
 an integrated control system.
         
            
 Article 3(1) of Regulation No 3508/provides: The computerised database shall record, for each agricultural holding, the data obtained from the aid applications. This database
         shall in particular allow direct and immediate consultation, through the competent authority of the Member State, of the data
         relating at least to the previous three consecutive calendar and/or marketing years.
         
            
 Pursuant to Article of Regulation No 3508/92: The alphanumeric identification system for agricultural parcels shall be established on the basis of land registry maps and
         documents, other cartographic references or of aerial photographs or satellite pictures or other equivalent supporting references
         or on the basis of more than one of these elements.
         
            
 Article of Regulation No 3508/provides: The system for the identification and registration of animals to be taken into account for the granting of aid governed by
         this Regulation shall be set up in accordance with Articles 4, 5, and of Directive 92/102/EEC.
         
            
 Council Directive 92/102/EEC of November on the identification and registration of animals (OJ L 355, p. 32)
         requires, in particular in Articles 4(1)(a), 5, and 8, that any keeper of bovine animals keeps a register stating the number
         of animals present on the holding and that each animal carry an identification mark bearing an alphanumeric code. As from
         July 1997, those requirements were completed, for bovine species, by the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 820/of April establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and regarding the labelling
         of beef and beef products (OJ L 117, p. 1), in particular Articles and thereof, which provide for the use of new
         eartags bearing a uniform identification code established at Community level and the creation of a computerised database intended
         to gather the information relating to the animal, the agricultural undertaking and the animal's movements. 
         
            
 Article of Regulation No 3508/states: The integrated control system shall cover all aid applications submitted, in particular as regards administrative checks,
         on-the-spot checks and, if appropriate, verification by aerial or satellite remote sensing.
         
            
 As regards checks, Article of Regulation No 3508/states: 
         
1.
 Member States shall carry out administrative checks on aid applications.
         
2.
 Administrative checks shall be supplemented by on-the-spot checks covering a sample of agricultural holdings. For all these
         checks, Member States shall draw up a sampling plan.
         
3.
 Each Member State shall designate an authority responsible for coordinating the checks provided for in this Regulation.
         
4.
 National authorities may, under conditions to be laid down, use remote sensing to determine the area of agricultural parcels,
         identify crops and verify their status.
         
5.
 Where the competent authorities of the Member State delegate some aspects of the work to be carried out pursuant to this Regulation
         to specialised agencies or firms, they must retain control over and responsibility for that work.
         
            
 Pursuant to Article 13(1) of Regulation No 3508/92, aid applications, the alphanumeric system for the identification and registration
         of bovine animals and the integrated control system provided for under the IACS are to apply from February 1993, while the
         other elements of the IACS are to be operational from January 1996. The latter date was extended to January by Council
         Regulation (EC) No 2466/of December 1996, amending Regulation No 3508/(OJ L 335, p. 1). 
         
            
 The criteria and technical rules for administrative and on-the-spot checks which must be carried out by Member States in the
         framework of the IACS are defined by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3887/of December laying down detailed rules
         for applying the integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes (OJ L 391, p. 36). According
         to Article 6(1) to (5) of that regulation: 
         
1.
 Administrative and on-the-spot checks shall be made in such a way as to ensure effective verification of compliance with the
         terms under which aids and premiums are granted.
         
2.
 The administrative checks referred to in Article 8(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3508/shall include cross-checks on parcels
         and animals declared in order to ensure that aid is not granted twice in respect of the same calendar year without justification.
         
3.
 On-the-spot checks shall cover at least a significant percentage of applications. The significant percentage shall represent
         at least:
         
─
 10% of  
            livestock aid applications or participation declarations, 
          10% of  
         livestock aid applications or participation declarations, 
         
─
5% of
            
 area aid applications. However, this percentage shall be reduced to 3% for area aid applications numbering more than per
         Member State in the calendar [year]. 
         
 Should on-the-spot checks reveal significant irregularities in a region or part of a region the competent authority shall
         make additional checks during the current year in that area and shall increase the percentage of applications to be checked
         in the following year.
         
4.
 Applications subjected to on-the-spot checking shall be selected by the competent authority on the basis of a risk analysis
         and an element of representativeness of the aid applications submitted. The risk analysis shall take account of:
         
─
 the amount of aid involved,
          the amount of aid involved,
         
─
 the number of parcels and the area or number of animals for which aid is requested, 
          the number of parcels and the area or number of animals for which aid is requested, 
         
─
 changes from the previous year, 
          changes from the previous year, 
         
─
 the findings of checks made in past years, 
          the findings of checks made in past years, 
         
─
 other factors to be defined by the Member State. 
          other factors to be defined by the Member State. 
         
5.

          Aid for early retirement from farming
         
            
 In the framework of the accompanying measures for the reform of the support mechanisms for agricultural markets undertaken
         in 1992, Council Regulation (EEC) No 2079/of June instituting a Community aid scheme for early retirement from
         farming (OJ L 215, p. 91) provides that Member States may institute a Community aid scheme for early retirement from
         farming, part-financed by the Guarantee section of the EAGGF. Under Article thereof, Member States are to implement that
         scheme by means of multiannual programmes drawn up at national or regional level. 
          National legislation
         
            
 Article of Law No 1409/of September on the granting of financial aid to agriculture, husbandry, forestry and
         fisheries provides: In order to meet the administrative and management costs resulting from the payment of financial aid, cooperatives may, when
         paying producers the amount which they have received, deduct on their own behalf up to 2% of the financial aid due to each
         producer.
         
            
 That provision was amended by Article of Law No 2538/97, which came into force on December and added a new subparagraph
         under which  
         [t]he deduction of the percentage provided for in the preceding subparagraph shall not apply to amounts paid to the EAGGF
         account unless Community legislation provides otherwise. 
         
            
 Article of the Decree of the Ministers for National Economy and for Agriculture of November defines the obligations
         of agricultural cooperative associations (hereinafter  
         ACAs) as regards the management of aid granted to producers. Articles and of the Decree make clear that those organisations
         are an integral part of the mechanism for the payment of aid and that, in practice, they play the principal role in managing
         Community aid. The Greek payment agency, Didagep, sends payment orders to the ACAs and pays aid to those associations, which
         in turn pay the recipients. 
         
            
 Joint Ministerial Order No 407756/of the Ministers for Finance, for National Economy and for Agriculture of September
         1994, adopted pursuant to Law No 2237/for the implementation of Regulation (EEC) No 2079/and legislation on related
         questions, entrusts the implementation of the programme for early retirement from farming to the Agricultural Bank of Greece
         (hereinafter  
         ATE), which functions as the authorised agent of the State. ATE is responsible for holding a full record for each recipient and
         for carrying out sample checks.  
         
            
 Article of Ministerial Order No 407756/provides that the authority responsible for implementing the measure is to carry
         out sample checks on 5% of recipients, in the form of on-the-spot or logistical checks of both the recipient of the early
         retirement aid and his successor. 
         
            
 An order of the Minister for Agriculture of January entrusts ACAs with the payment of all types of financial aid.
         It sets the percentages for deductions, which range from 2% to 0.5% according to how long it takes ACAs to present proof of
         payment. Recital (d) in the preamble thereto states: ... the 2% maximum deduction provided for by the abovementioned provisions was established with a view to hasten payments
         in order for producers to derive maximum profit from the receipt in good time of any financial aid due to them.On this view, cooperatives which are late in presenting proof of payment or in paying producers although they have received
         the amounts which are intended for the latter cannot deduct the abovementioned amount, since that would be contrary to the
         purpose intended by the legislature.
         
            
 Ministry of Agriculture Circular No of March provides that subsidies must be paid to recipients in their entirety
         and that any deduction or reduction is contrary to Community law. 
         Facts of the case and the pre-litigation procedure Support scheme for producers of certain arable crops
         
            
 During a mission carried out in Greece from to April 1996, seeking to examine the implementation of the support system
         for producers of certain arable crops, the Commission observed significant shortcomings and deficiencies in the management
         and monitoring of aid in the arable crops sector for the to harvests, corresponding to the financial years to 1998, primarily with respect to the following points: 
         
─
 failure fully to implement the IACS, in the absence of a computerised inventory of parcels;

 Aid scheme for early retirement from farming  
         
            
 Following a check carried out in June 1997, the Commission, by letter of November 1998, informed the Greek authorities that
         the quality of on-the-spot checks carried out by the ATE with respect to aid for early retirement was insufficient and, in
         particular: 
         
─
 the checks by the Greek authorities did not comply with the requirements concerning the annual rate of sample checks provided
            for by Ministerial Order No 407756/6081; 
          the checks by the Greek authorities did not comply with the requirements concerning the annual rate of sample checks provided

─
 in the absence of a visit to the recipient of the early retirement aid and his successor, it was impossible to be sure that
            the successor was in fact cultivating the areas given over by the farmer taking early retirement and to determine the number
            of livestock on the holding;

 Premiums for beef and veal producers
         
            
 By letters of July 1997, May and November 1998, and March, April, May and June 1999, the Commission noted:
         
         
─
 a 2% deduction on premiums for bovine animals paid by the ACAs;

            financial year 1996. 
          non-compliance with the time-limit for payment, which expired on October 1996, and discrepancies in the accounts for the
         financial year 1996. 
         
 Corrections proposed by the Commission on compensatory payments to producers of arable crops, aid to farm income and aid to
         early retirement from agriculture, and report of the conciliation body
         
            
 By letter of September 1999, the Commission services notified the Greek authorities that they intended to apply a financial
         correction: 
         
(1)
 of GRD in the arable crops sector, on the basis of the delay noted in implementing the IACS, that is: 
         
─
 a correction of 5% for applications relating to the to harvests which were subject to a classical on-the-spot check,
         
         
 and
         
─
 a correction of 2% for applications which were subject to checks by remote sensing, where the requirements concerning on-the-spot
         inspections were in general complied with but for which delays in carrying out rapid on-site visits were noted; 
         
(2)
 of GRD 782, namely a correction of 2%, on aid to income and aid for early retirement, on the ground that the follow-up
         of the management of that aid and its supervision and control by the central authorities were not up to the standard required
         by Community legislation. 
         
            
 By letter of November 1999, the Greek authorities referred the matter to the Conciliation Body. 
         
            
 In its final report of March 2000, the Conciliation Body finds that, as regards arable crops, it is not possible to reconcile
         the points of view of the two parties and asks the Commission services to re-examine the system of alternative checks applied
         in Greece and to draw the appropriate conclusions from that examination as to what level of corrections to propose. The Conciliation
         Body did not examine the case with respect to aid for early retirement because the amount of the proposed correction was less
         than the minimum amount set for referral of a case. 
          Corrections proposed by the Commission on the premiums paid to beef and veal producers and report of the Conciliation Body
         
            
 By letter of June 1999, the Commission services notified the Greek authorities that they intended to apply a financial
         correction of 10% of the expenses relating to the schemes for premiums for bovine animals in the financial years 1996, and 1998, namely the amount of GRD 000, on the ground that those authorities had not set up an identification and
         registration system for bovine animals, so that the IACS was not functioning on January 1997, when the time-limit set for
         its implementation expired, and that payments had been late and out of time. The proposed correction was completed, by letter
         of August 1999, by an additional correction of GRD 000. 
         
            
 By letter of July 1999, the Greek authorities referred the matter to the Conciliation Body. 
         
            
 In its final report of January 2000, the Conciliation Body states that it is not possible to reconcile the positions of
         the two parties, considers that it could be useful for the Commission services to reconsider the question of the correction
         for the delay in payment and asks them to re-examine the alternative checks applied in Greece to determine whether or not
         they satisfy the criteria of general effectiveness.  
          The contested decision
         
            
 By the contested decision, the Commission decided to exclude GRD from Community financing for expenditure effected
         for the to harvests in the arable crop and the beef and veal sectors, and in the area of aid for early retirement.
         
         
            
 The Hellenic Republic disputes the refusal of financing by the EAGGF for the following amounts: 
         
─
 GRD paid as compensatory aid in the arable crops sector, on the basis of deficiencies in the IACS and the irregular
            deduction of part of the aid (first, sixth and seventh pleas);

            and sixth pleas); 
          GRD paid as aid for early retirement from farming, on the basis of the poor quality of checks and monitoring (second

            the IACS (third and sixth pleas); 
          GRD paid as premiums in the beef and veal sector, on the basis of the failure completely to establish or apply
         the IACS (third and sixth pleas); 
         
─

            on the basis of the delay in making those payments (fourth and fifth pleas); 
          GRD and GRD paid as supplementary payments in the beef and veal sector pursuant to Regulation No 1357/96,
         on the basis of the delay in making those payments (fourth and fifth pleas); 
         
─

            in making the corresponding payments (eighth plea). 
          GRD ─ included in a total correction of GRD ─ paid in the arable crops sector, on the basis of a delay
         in making the corresponding payments (eighth plea). 
         
            
 In support of its application, the Hellenic Government in essence states that the contested decision erroneously interprets
         and applies legislative provisions and is based on errors of fact or an inadequate statement of reasons and that, in imposing
         the contested corrections, the Commission exceeded the limits of its discretion and infringed the principle of proportionality.
         
         First plea in law
            
 The first plea relates to the deficiencies in the application of the integrated system in the arable crops sector.  Arguments of the parties
         
            
 The Greek Government considers that the Commission incorrectly evaluated the facts, infringed the principle of proportionality
         and misinterpreted Article of Regulation No 3508/92. 
         
            
 As regards the alphanumeric system, the identification of parcels by orthophotography was partly used in nomoi (districts)
         for applications made in 1998, with its full use envisaged as from January 1999. For the previous marketing years, the identification
         and coding of parcels was carried out using different but equally conclusive methods, such as the aerial photography, maps,
         diagrams and allocations of the topographical service of the Ministry of Agriculture, and orthophotographs where available.
         The coding of agricultural parcels by the Greek authorities for the 1997/marketing year therefore satisfies the requirements
         of Article of Regulation No 3508/and the weaknesses alleged by the Commission do not amount to a serious problem, given
         the complexity of the IACS, which requires the use of a large number of different technical methods. 
         
            
 As regards the creation of a computerised database, the Greek Government states that new computer equipment has already been
         installed in the regional departments and that the call for tender for the development of new software has had to be relaunched.
         The fact that on-line links with the regional departments have not been completed explains the discrepancies observed in the
         statistical data. The delays found in on-the-spot checks or checks by remote sensing are due to the fact that the work was
         entrusted to private parties and that calls for tender take some time, as would be the case, for that matter, in any Member
         State.  
         
            
 As regards checks, the Greek Government maintains that duplicate registrations of parcels and applications are cross-checked
         at the local level, with the results examined by the prefectoral departments, with the possibility of applying penalties as
         provided for in Community legislation. At all stages of the checks, the local departments of the Ministry of Agriculture work
         together with the ACAs and, as from the 1998/marketing year, checks carried out by those departments are listed in  
         checklists and no order for payment is given until the computer department of that Ministry has cross-checked the information contained
         in the database with that provided in the payment statements, in accordance with the requirements of Regulation No 1663/95.
         As of the marketing year 1998/99, the cross-checking of data at national level was carried out prior to payment, while for
         previous years, where irregularities were observed following payment, the sums wrongly paid had to be recovered. In any case,
         all checks were reviewed by the local services of the Ministry of Agriculture. 
         
            
 As regards the notice given for on-the-spot checks, the Greek Government states that all local services give 48-hours notice
         and that the case cited by the Commission is a random one unrepresentative of the country as a whole. 
         
            
 The imposition of a 2% correction on applications which were subject to checks by remote sensing is therefore incorrect, given
         the progress which has been made with a view to completing and carrying out the IACS. The imposition of a 5% correction on
         applications subject to classic on-the-spot checks is contrary to the principle of proportionality and should be withdrawn,
         or at least reduced to 2%.  
         
            
 According to the Commission, it is apparent from the reply by the Greek authorities that, during the marketing years to 1997, the principal measures of the IACS were not implemented. The risk of financial loss to the EAGGF was extremely high
         and the gaps observed during checks showed that there was a general weakness in the integrated system, so that the 5% correction
         could be deemed extremely lenient. 
         
            
 As regards the applications subject to checks by remote sensing, the Commission points out that hasty site visits were carried
         out belatedly and that certain facts observed with the aid of photographs, showing anomalies as regards areas and crops, were
         not followed up. The Greek authorities failed to investigate on-site, at the appropriate time, whether the products being
         grown in areas corresponded to those for which aid had been requested. Since on-the-spot visits represent an important part
         of remote sensing techniques, the Commission is of the opinion that the correction of 2% is proportional to the way in which
         such gaps are treated in other Member States. 
          Findings of the Court
         
            
 It should be recalled that Article 8(1) of Regulation No 729/imposes on the Member States the obligation to take the measures
         necessary to satisfy themselves that the transactions financed by the EAGGF are actually carried out and are executed correctly,
         to prevent and deal with irregularities and to recover sums lost as a result of irregularities or negligence, even if the
         specific Community act does not expressly provide for the adoption of particular supervisory measures (Case C-373/Greece v  
         Commission [2001] ECR I-9619, paragraph 9). 
         
            
 In addition, although the Commission is required to justify its decision to refuse to charge expenditure effected by a Member
         State to the EAGGF Guarantee section by providing evidence of serious reasonable doubt as to the existence or appropriateness
         of checks carried out in that Member State, it is nevertheless not obliged to provide details of the inadequacy of those checks
         or the inaccuracy of the data provided by the Member State. It is the latter which is best placed to collect and verify the
         data required and to provide proof concerning the genuineness of the checks and the inaccuracy of the Commission's claims
         (see to that effect Case C-54/Germany v  
         Commission [1999] ECR I-35, paragraph 35; Case C-247/Greece v  
         Commission [2001] ECR I-1, paragraph 7; and Case C-377/Germany v  
         Commission [1999] ECR I-7421, paragraph 95). 
         
            
 Pursuant to that case-law, it is for the Greek Government to shown that, during the financial years to 1998, the Hellenic
         Republic implemented a reliable and effective system of checks, corresponding to the to harvests, and that the complaints
         drawn up by the Commission as a result of the substantive investigations carried out by its services were unfounded.  
         
            
 As regards the implementation of the IACS, the Greek Government admits that the computerised database provided for in Articles
         and of Regulation No 3508/was not set up within the prescribed period and was not functioning during the financial
         years at issue. 
         
            
 Although the Greek Government states that it carried out the alphanumeric identification of agricultural parcels using cartographic
         methods, it has not demonstrated that this was done on the basis of aerial photographs or spatial imaging and, in any event,
         it has not shown that all the agricultural parcels had been identified when the prescribed period for implementing the IACS
         expired on January 1997. 
         
            
 In addition, the Greek Government does not deny the delays and deficiencies attributed to it as regards the statistical data
         which must be sent to the Commission under Article of Regulation No 658/96. 
         
            
 Nor does the Greek Government deny the delays in carrying out checks by remote sensing and on-the-spot checks ─ delays which
         are the cause of other deficiencies such as difficulties in identifying the crops being grown on certain parcels.  
         
            
 As regards the monitoring carried out by the ACAs, the Greek Government has not demonstrated that those databases can be directly
         accessed by computer. 
         
            
 Given the importance of setting up the IACS and the extent of the deficiencies in carrying out checks, the flat-rate corrections
         of 5% and 2% appear consistent with the guidelines set down by the Commission in its working Documents VI/216/and VI/5330/97.
         
         
            
 In the light of the foregoing considerations, the first plea must be rejected as unfounded. 
         Second plea in law
            
 The second plea relates to shortcomings in the control and monitoring of aid for early retirement from farming. 
          Arguments of the parties
         
            
 The Greek Government is of the view that the procedure as a whole and the implementation of the programme for early retirement
         from farming comply with the requirements of Regulation No 2079/and the Annex to Regulation No 1663/95. The first payments
         at national level began in July 1995, since there were only recipients in that year, so that some of the sampling checks
         scheduled for were carried out in 1997, with recipients, namely 8.5% of the total, being checked in 1996. During
         1997, sample checks were carried out, namely 6.6% of the total of recipients for the year 1996. The records of those
         checks, including dates and the signatures of the competent officials, are held in the ATE's offices and are available to
         any control body. 
         
            
 The Greek Government states that the faults observed during the Community inspection carried out at the ATE office in Edessa
         (Greece) were primarily administrative in nature and did not relate to any substantial gap in the documents which make up
         the files of the recipients who are dependent on that agency ─ files which the Commission services found failed to comply
         with good administrative performance in various ways. 
         
            
 The Commission points out that the Greek authorities have provided neither proof for nor the dates of checks. It points out
         that, although the agronomist went to the local area concerned, he did not visit the farmer taking early retirement or his
         successor. 
          Findings of the Court
         
            
 The Greek Government does not dispute the findings of the Commission services but refers to the national legislation relating
         to the management of early retirement, although it does not put forward any proof of its implementation. 
         
            
 Accordingly, doubts persist as to the number and frequency of checks, the more so since the documents relating to financial
         expenditure by the EAGGF are absent from the files or are difficult to consult and errors concerning the identity of recipients
         or the area of holdings have been found. 
         
            
 In those circumstances, the second plea must be rejected as unfounded. 
         Third plea in law
            
 The third plea concerns the absence or incomplete creation of the IACS, delays in payment or payment out of time in the beef
         sector. 
          Arguments of the parties
         
            
 The Greek Government states that, while it is true that Community legislation requires setting up the IACS and a system for
         the identification and registration of bovine animals before January 1997, it is also the case that their actual implementation,
         full development and operation, immediately and at national level, are made more difficult by the specific characteristics
         of Greece, namely the predominance of mountainous areas and the distance of breeders from urban centres, lengthening the time
         required for the training and education of breeders with a view to implementing the procedures laid down in the IACS. 
         
            
 The Greek Government considers that the flat-rate correction of 10% of advances in relation to the expenditure on premiums
         for bovine animals declared for the marketing year 1997, as the result of the failure to implement the computerised database
         and the system for the identification and registration of bovine animals, is not justified in so far as the identification
         of bovine animals by means of new earmarks is almost complete and the failure to complete the central on-line system by January has not prevented the partial implementation of computer systems which have made it possible to carry out cross-checks
         with the same results. The Greek authorities carry out on-the-spot checks for 100% of applications for aid, which averts any
         possibility that premiums will be paid for ineligible animals.  
         
            
 The Commission considers that the correction applied is justified in the light of the failure to implement the system for
         the identification and registration of bovine animals, the failure to implement the IACS and all the deficiencies of the existing
         national system for administration and control. According to the Commission, even if the claim by the Greek authorities that
         100% of applicants have been checked is correct ─ a claim not supported by any proof ─ this is not a sufficient basis for
         considering that those checks were reliable and complied with the relevant Community legislation. It is not possible to implement
         cross-checks if, contrary to the requirements of Directive 92/102, bovine animals are not identified. 
          Findings of the Court
         
            
 It must be noted that the Greek Government does not deny the failure to set up the computerised database referred to in Article
         of Regulation No 3508/or the failure completely to implement the system for the identification and registration of bovine
         animals. 
         
            
 In that regard, suffice it to point out that the lack of a reliable system for the identification and registration of bovine
         animals entails an increased risk of loss for the Community budget. 
         
            
 Similarly, the failure to set up a computerised database making it possible to check all information also entails an increased
         risk of loss for the Community budget. 
         
            
 The third plea must therefore be rejected as unfounded. 
         Fourth and fifth pleas in law
            
 The fourth and fifth pleas relate to the corrections applied on the basis of the delay in carrying out the additional payments
         provided for in Regulation No 1357/96, which was adopted in order to deal with the serious disturbances of the market as a
         result of the appearance of bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Those corrections are based on the fact that the Hellenic Republic
         effected additional payments after October 1996, namely the payments made to the ACAs after that date for the purpose of
         their subsequent payment to claimants, in the amount of GRD (amount finally reduced to GRD as the
         result of the Conciliation Body's report) and the payments made to the ACAs before October but paid to claimants after
         that date, in the amount of GRD 000. 
          Arguments of the parties
         
            
 The Greek Government claims that the financial correction applied is not justified because it is based on an incorrect legal
         premiss and constitutes a disproportionate penalty, contrary to the objective of compensating the financial losses experienced
         by producers owing to the serious disturbance of the market for beef and veal as a result of the appearance of bovine spongiform
         encephalopathy. It was not possible by October to have available all the data necessary to establish the right to
         a premium for the calendar year 1996. In fact, once they had collected all the data for 1996, the Greek authorities brought
         proceedings to recover payments of undue amounts. After the data were finalised, it appeared necessary to pay certain amounts
         after October 1996, namely, the premiums paid to producers who declared a higher number of eligible animals in than
         in and were therefore entitled to new additional payments. This was not a question of late payments but rather a book-keeping
         regularisation of credit or debit balances.  
         
            
 The Greek Government states that the second subparagraph of Article of Regulation No 1357/must be interpreted to mean
         that additional payments can be deemed to have been  
         made by Member States by October at the latest if the competent authorities have by that date sent the payment orders
         to the institutions which are responsible for paying recipients and, accordingly, if the corresponding right to payment is
         established by the latter, independently of whether the amounts in question have in fact been paid or not. The contrary interpretation
         which is supported by the Commission runs counter to the objective of Regulation No 1357/in cases where it is not possible
         to pay the amounts owing to subjective factors linked to the persons recognised as recipients. The contested amount of GRD 000, corresponding to the financial year 1996, is made up of small amounts paid to small breeders after October because
         it was impossible for the ACAs in charge of payments to communicate with them as a result of the mountainous and inaccessible
         nature of the breeding regions, although the payment orders had been given by the authorities before October 1996.  
         
            
 The Commission takes the view that the time-limit laid down in Article of Regulation No 1357/relates to expenses which
         can be financed by the Community until October at the latest, so that payments made after that date are not financed.
         That time-limit concerns the date on which the recipients of the payment must have received the subsidies and not the date
         on which those amounts were sent to the cooperative associations. Significant amounts of aid, although they might have been
         sent to those associations before October 1996, had still not reached those to whom they were addressed several months
         later. 
         
            
 The Commission adds that the claimant under Regulation No 1357/is the breeder and not the cooperative, so that payment
         of the amount to the ACAs cannot be considered a procedure complying with the requirements of that regulation. 
          Findings of the Court
         
            
 It must be recalled that Article of Regulation No 1357/explicitly provides that expenses incurred by Member States under
         Articles and 4(a) of the Regulation, that is to say, special payments in addition to the premiums due in respect of animals
         eligible in the calendar year, are financed by the Community only if they take place  
         by October at the latest. That provision therefore assumes, as the Advocate General pointed out in point of his Opinion, that the data necessary
         for payment of the aid must to a very large extent be already available before that date. 
         
            
 In that regard, paragraphs 2(ii) and 6(v) of the Annex to Regulation No 1663/define the execution of payments as the issuing
         of an instruction to a bank or a governmental payments office to pay the amount which is due to the recipient, which requires
         a direct payment to the latter. 
         
            
 Moreover, the Greek Government did not provide documents which were able to establish that the amount of GRD was
         paid by October at the latest or that the amount of GRD was paid to the recipients by that date at the
         latest. As regards the first amount, the Greek Government merely calculated the additional payments which it could legitimately
         pay to breeders, without, however, taking into account the payments made, of GRD for the year 1995, which amounted
         to the limit for additional payments which could be made for the year under Article of Regulation No 1357/96. As regards
         the second amount, the interpretation suggested by the Greek Government, that the rebate to the ACA before October of the amount of the additional payments with a view to paying these to recipients after that date complies with the requirements
         of Regulation No 1357/96, cannot be accepted. Article of that regulation clearly requires payments to be made to recipients
         before that date.  
         
            
 Since the corrections made by the Commission correspond to the amount of the expenditure which was found not to comply with
         Regulation No 1357/96, the fourth and fifth pleas cannot be upheld. 
         Sixth plea in law
            
 The sixth ground relates to the principle of proportionality and the importance of the flat-rate corrections laid down by
         the Commission in the arable crop and beef and veal sectors and in the area of aid for early retirement from farming. 
          Arguments of the parties
         
            
 The Greek Government considers that the Commission services did not find deficiencies which were serious enough to amount
         to an infringement of specific Community rules in the implementation and management of the IACS in the arable crop and beef
         and veal sectors or in the quality of the checks on aid for early retirement from farming and to justify the imposition of
         the contested financial corrections. The Commission has therefore infringed Article 5(2)(c) of Regulation No 729/and the
         criteria for flat-rate correction, exceeded the limits of its discretion and infringed the principle of proportionality, so
         that the proposed corrections should be annulled or reduced to 2%. 
         
            
 The Commission contends that the Greek Government's challenge of the deficiencies and weaknesses observed in respect of the
         failure to comply with Community legislation is not well founded.  
          Findings of the Court
         
            
 First of all, it is necessary to take into account the fact that the Greek Government has not succeeded in establishing that
         the Commission's findings are incorrect, or the existence of a suitable and efficient system of monitoring and control measures.
          
         
            
 Secondly, the Greek Government has not demonstrated that the observed irregularities do not affect or only slightly affect
         the Community budget.  
         
            
 It must therefore be held that the Greek Government has not demonstrated that the corrections applied by the Commission were
         arbitrary or in conflict with Article 5(2)(c) of Regulation No 729/70. 
         
            
 That plea must therefore be rejected as unfounded. 
         Seventh plea in law
            
 The seventh plea relates to the 2% deduction for expenses and administrative costs made by the ACAs from the amount of aid
         paid to recipients. That practice prompted financial corrections equal to 2% of the expenditure declared by the Hellenic Republic
         in the arable crops sector for the financial years to and in the beef and veal sector for the financial years and 1997. 
          Arguments of the parties
         
            
 The Greek Government claims that the deduction, the rate of which varies between 0.5% and 2%, was voluntary, agreed to in
         writing by the parties concerned and decided by the ACAs in compensation for the services which they provided their members,
         for example, the services of an agronomist, a legal advisor or an economic advisor, the opportunity to have recourse to veterinary
         services, to benefit from advice, etc. In addition, the Greek authorities cannot intervene in matters where freedom of contract
         in relations between agricultural cooperatives and their members applies. 
         
            
 The Greek Government relies on Circular No of March 1997, which specifies that subsidies must be paid to recipients
         in their entirety and that any deduction or reduction is contrary to Community law. The deduction made by the ACAs pursuant
         to Article of Law No 1409/was revoked by Article of Law No 2538/97, which came into force on December 1997, so that
         the financial correction was imposed on the basis of an erroneous interpretation of the provisions of domestic law and must
         therefore be annulled. In the alternative, since the deductions varied between 0.5% and 2%, the correction should be set as
         the average of those figures, namely 1.25%.  
         
            
 The Commission points out that the involvement of ACAs in the management and payment of compensatory aid to recipients in
         the arable crop sector is obligatory and that, in practice, they are responsible for monitoring data, checking reliability,
         setting up a computerised list of payments and paying aid to farmers, whether or not the latter are members of a cooperative,
         so that the services which they provide cannot be considered to be independent. 
         
            
 The Commission points out that under the case-law of the Court the Member States are required not only to refrain from imposing
         or maintaining in force measures which allow deductions, but also to adopt the necessary measures in order to prohibit any
         deductions being made. However, in the present case, the Greek authorities simply added a new legislative provision under
         which deductions do not relate to the amounts paid at the expense of the EAGGF, thereby creating legal uncertainty, and failed
         to take adequate measures to end the practice of deductions, which is all the more serious since ACAs involvement in the payment
         and management of compensatory aid for arable crops is mandatory. 
          Findings of the Court
         
            
 It is appropriate to point out that in Case C-247/Greece v  
         Commission (paragraphs 18, and 32) and Case C-373/Greece v  
         Commission (paragraphs to 39), cited above, which relate to the financial years and 1995, respectively, the Court already dismissed
         the arguments put forward by the Hellenic Republic to justify the practice of deductions. 
         
            
 The Greek Government has not put forward any relevant new information to invalidate that conclusion, even taking into account
         the amendment to Article of Law No 1409/by Article of Law No 2538/and Circular No of March 1997. Those
         legislative texts do not demonstrate that the practice of making deductions has in fact ceased or that the deductions made
         before March were reimbursed. In that regard, the complaints made by the Commission services to the Greek authorities
         that the ACAs were continuing the practice of deductions in spite of the legislative amendment was not refuted by any evidence
         put forward by those authorities. 
         
            
 Since the Greek authorities did not comply with the obligations relating to the payment of the entirety of aid to recipients
         which result from Regulations No 1765/92, 1357/and 805/68, and in the absence of information which could have precisely
         quantified the extent of those deductions, the correction of 2% must be found to be justified, so that the seventh plea must
         be rejected. 
         Eighth plea in law
            
 The eighth plea relates to the financial corrections of GRD resulting from the failure to comply with the time-limits
         for payment laid down in Article of Regulation No 296/in the arable crop sector for the financial year 1998. 
          Arguments of the parties
         
            
 Without denying that the expenditure in question was made after the prescribed period had expired, the Greek Government states
         that those payments were effected in four specific cases, in the context of legal proceedings or the carrying out of specific
         controls or administrative checks for the purpose of forestalling irregularities in the operation of the EAGGF. 
         
            
 The Commission points out that only exceptional difficulties in a large number of cases would constitute valid justification
         for precluding the reductions to advances provided for in Article of Regulation No 296/96.  
          Findings of the Court
         
            
 It must be held that the Greek Government, which refers to two letters setting out the grounds for delays in payment, has
         not provided any evidence confirming the correctness of those grounds or demonstrating that the delays did not exceed reasonable
         limits. 
         
            
 Therefore, the eighth plea must also be rejected and, accordingly, the application by the Hellenic Republic must be dismissed.
         
         
Costs
            
 Under Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been
         applied for in the successful party's pleadings. Since the Commission has applied for costs and the Hellenic Republic has
         been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to pay the costs. 
         
On those grounds, 
THE COURT (Fifth Chamber)
 hereby: 
         
1.
 Dismisses the application; 
            
2.
 Orders the Hellenic Republic to pay the costs.
