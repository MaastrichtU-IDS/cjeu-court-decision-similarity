Operative part: 
1.
	Article 221(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/of October establishing the Community Customs Code is to be
                     interpreted as meaning that the ‘entry in the accounts’ of the amount of the duty to be recovered referred to therein is the
                     ‘entry in the accounts’ of that amount as defined in Article 217(1) of that regulation and that that entry in the accounts
                     is to be distinguished from the recording of that duty in the accounts of the own resources referred to in Article of Council
                     Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1552/of May implementing Decision 88/376/EEC, Euratom on the system of the Communities’
                     own resources.
                  
2.
	Article 221(1) of Regulation No 2913/is to be interpreted as meaning that the communication of the amount of duty to be
                     recovered must have been preceded by the entry in the accounts of that amount by the customs authorities of the Member State
                     and that, in the absence of due notification in accordance with that provision, that amount may not be recovered by those
                     authorities. However, those authorities remain entitled to proceed with a new notification of that amount, in accordance with
                     the conditions laid down by that provision and the limitation rules in force at the time the customs debt arose.
