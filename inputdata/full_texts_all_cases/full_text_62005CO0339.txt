Zentralbetriebsrat der Landeskrankenhäuser Tirols

Land Tirol,
THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECOND CHAMBER OF THE COURT,
after hearing Advocate General Ruiz-Jarabo Colomer,
makes the following
Order
By letter of June 2006, received at the Court Registry on July 2006, the Landesgericht Innsbruck informed the Court that
         the parties had agreed a permanent suspension (‘ewiges Ruhen’) of the proceedings.
      
In those circumstances, the present case must be removed from the register.
Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the proceedings pending before the national
         court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court.  
      
On those grounds, the President of the Second Chamber of the Court hereby orders:
Case C-339/is removed from the register. 
Luxembourg, August 2006.
