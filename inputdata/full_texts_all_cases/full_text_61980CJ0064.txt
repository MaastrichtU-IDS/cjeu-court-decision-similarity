APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT REGULATION NO 160/OF THE COUNCIL OF JANUARY AMENDING THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS AND THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OTHER SERVANTS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) IS VOID , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON FEBRUARY , F . GIUFFRIDA , AN OFFICIAL OF THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES AND G . CAMPOGRANDE , AN OFFICIAL OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , BROUGHT PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT COUNCIL REGULATION NO 160/OF JANUARY AMENDING THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS AND THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OTHER SERVANTS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ) IS VOID .   ACCORDING TO THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY A NATURAL PERSON HAS THE RIGHT TO INSTITUTE PROCEEDINGS FOR A DECLARATION THAT A DECISION IS VOID ONLY IF THE DECISION IS ADDRESSED TO THAT PERSON OR , ALTHOUGH IN THE FORM OF A REGULATION , IS OF DIRECT AND INDIVIDUAL CONCERN TO HIM . THE ACTION BY THE APPLICANTS FOR A DECLARATION THAT A COUNCIL REGULATION IS VOID IS THEREFORE ADMISSIBLE ONLY IN SO FAR AS IT APPEARS THAT THE CONTESTED MEASURE , ALTHOUGH IN THE FORM OF A REGULATION , IS OF DIRECT AND INDIVIDUAL CONCERN TO THEM .   UNDER THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY THE TEST FOR DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN A REGULATION AND A DECISION IS TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE MEASURE IN QUESTION HAS GENERAL APPLICATION OR NOT .   ARTICLE OF COUNCIL REGULATION NO 160/AMENDS ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND ARTICLES AND OF THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OTHER SERVANTS BY SUBSTITUTING FOR THE TABLES OF MONTHLY BASIC SALARIES AND REMUNERATION INCORPORATED IN THOSE PROVISIONS TABLES MODIFYING THOSE SALARIES AND THAT REMUNERATION .   ARTICLE OF THE SAME REGULATION PROVIDES CERTAIN TRANSITIONAL MEASURES RELATING TO THE APPLICATION OF THOSE MODIFIED SALARIES AND REMUNERATION FOR     OFFICIALS OR FORMER OFFICIALS WHO FIND THEMSELVES IN THE OBJECTIVE FINANCIAL SITUATION DESCRIBED IN THAT ARTICLE .   IT FOLLOWS THAT THE CONTESTED REGULATION APPLIES TO OBJECTIVELY DETERMINED SITUATIONS AND INVOLVES LEGAL EFFECTS IN RESPECT OF CATEGORIES OF PERSONS REGARDED GENERALLY AND IN THE ABSTRACT . IT DOES THEREFORE HAVE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A REGULATION .   THESE CHARACTERISTICS ARE NOT CALLED IN QUESTION BY THE FACT THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE MORE OR LESS EXACTLY THE NUMBER OR EVEN THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSONS TO WHOM IT APPLIES AT ANY GIVEN TIME AS LONG AS IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT SUCH APPLICATION TAKES EFFECT , AS IN THIS CASE , BY VIRTUE OF AN OBJECTIVE LEGAL OR FACTUAL SITUATION DEFINED BY THE INSTRUMENT IN QUESTION IN RELATION TO ITS PURPOSE .   THE ACTION MUST THEREFORE BE DECLARED INADMISSIBLE .  
Decision on costs
SINCE THE PRESENT ACTION IS BASED UPON ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY AND NOT UPON ARTICLE IT IS ARTICLE ( ) AND NOT ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE WHICH APPLIES .   PURSUANT TO THAT ARTICLE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS IF THEY HAVE BEEN ASKED FOR IN THE SUCCESSFUL PARTY ' S PLEADING . SINCE THE APPLICANTS HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL THEY MUST BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS JOINTLY .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ( THIRD CHAMBER )   HEREBY :   . DISMISSES THE ACTION AS INADMISSIBLE ;      . ORDERS THE APPLICANTS JOINTLY TO PAY THE COSTS .
