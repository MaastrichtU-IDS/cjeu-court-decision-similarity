Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY BY FAILING TO BRING INTO FORCE WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 77/780/EEC OF DECEMBER ON THE COORDINATION OF LAWS , REGULATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE TAKING UP AND PURSUIT OF THE BUSINESS OF CREDIT INSTITUTIONS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON NOVEMBER THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT , BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 77/780/EEC OF DECEMBER ON THE COORDINATION OF THE LAWS , REGULATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE TAKING UP AND PURSUIT OF THE BUSINESS OF CREDIT INSTITUTIONS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE THIRD PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .   THE CASE MUST BE CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF THE BACKGROUND TO THE DIRECTIVE AND THE EVENTS WHICH PRECEDED THE COMMENCEMENT OF THESE PROCEEDINGS .   COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 77/CONSTITUTES THE FIRST STAGE IN THE HARMONIZATION OF BANKING STRUCTURES AND THE SUPERVISION THEREOF . THE PURPOSE OF SUCH HARMONIZATION IS TO PERMIT THE GRADUAL ATTAINMENT OF FREEDOM OF ESTABLISHMENT FOR CREDIT INSTITUTIONS AND THE LIBERALIZATION OF BANKING SERVICES . IN THAT RESPECT THE DIRECTIVE INTRODUCES CERTAIN MINIMUM CONDITIONS FOR THE AUTHORIZATION OF CREDIT INSTITUTIONS WHICH ALL MEMBER STATES MUST OBSERVE . IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE TAKING UP AND PURSUIT OF BUSINESS AS A CREDIT INSTITUTION THE DIRECTIVE AIMS IN PARTICULAR TO REDUCE THE DISCRETION ENJOYED BY CERTAIN SUPERVISORY AUTHORITIES IN AUTHORIZING CREDIT INSTITUTIONS .   ARTICLE ( ) OF THE DIRECTIVE PROVIDES THAT MEMBER STATES MUST BRING INTO FORCE THE MEASURES NECESSARY TO COMPLY THEREWITH WITHIN MONTHS OF ITS NOTIFICATION . THAT PERIOD EXPIRED IN THE PRESENT CASE ON DECEMBER . AS A RESULT OF THE DIRECTIVE A BILL WAS PREPARED IN BELGIUM BUT HAD NOT YET BEEN INTRODUCED INTO THE BELGIAN PARLIAMENT WHEN THE ACTION FOR A DECLARATION WAS BROUGHT BY THE COMMISSION .   IN ITS DEFENCE THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT EMPHASIZED FIRST OF ALL THE EXTENT OF THE TECHNICAL , INSTITUTIONAL AND POLITICAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH EXPLAIN WHY , IN SPITE OF THE EFFORTS IT HAS MADE , IT HAS NOT YET BEEN POSSIBLE TO PLACE THE BILL     INCORPORATING THE DIRECTIVE INTO NATIONAL LAW BEFORE PARLIAMENT . MOREOVER , SPECIAL PROBLEMS ARE SAID TO HAVE ARISEN FROM THE FACT THAT IT WAS DECIDED TO USE THE DIRECTIVE AS AN OCCASION FOR RECASTING THE BELGIAN BANKING LEGISLATION IN RELATION TO ALL CREDIT INSTITUTIONS .   ALTHOUGH THOSE CIRCUMSTANCE MAY EXPLAIN THE DIFFICULTIES IN APPLYING THE DIRECTIVE , THEY CANNOT EXPUNGE THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM ' S FAILURE TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS . THE COURT HAS CONSISTENTLY HELD THAT A MEMBER STATE MAY NOT PLEAD PROVISIONS , PRACTICES OR CIRCUMSTANCES IN ITS INTERNAL LEGAL ORDER TO JUSTIFY A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OBLIGATIONS UNDER COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES .   THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT ALSO CONSIDERS THAT INSUFFICIENT GROUNDS ARE GIVEN BOTH IN THE REASONED OPINION AND IN THE COMMISSION ' S APPLICATION , IN SO FAR AS THERE IS NO REFERENCE TO THE DIFFICULTIES ENTAILED BY THE APPLICATION OF THE DIRECTIVE OR TO ANY DEGREE OF INERTIA OR OPPOSITION ON THE PART OF THE BELGIAN STATE IN THAT REGARD . FURTHER , IT IS ARGUED THAT THE PERIOD ALLOWED IN THE REASONED OPINION IS INADEQUATE .   IN THAT RESPECT IT MUST BE OBSERVED THAT THE ADMISSIBILITY OF AN ACTION BASED ON ARTICLE OF THE TREATY DEPENDS ONLY ON AN OBJECTIVE FINDING OF A FAILURE TO FULFIL OBLIGATIONS AND NOT ON PROOF OF ANY INERTIA OR OPPOSITION ON THE PART OF THE MEMBER STATE CONCERNED . AS THE COURT HAS ALREADY STATED , THE OPINION REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE MUST BE CONSIDERED TO CONTAIN A SUFFICIENT STATEMENT OF REASONS TO SATISFY THE LAW WHEN IT CONTAINS A COHERENT EXPOSITION OF THE REASONS WHICH LED THE COMMISSION TO THE CONVICTION THAT THE STATE CONCERNED HAD FAILED TO FULFIL AN OBLIGATION UNDER THE TREATY . TO THAT EXTENT THE COMMISSION WAS NOT REQUIRED TO REFER TO ANY DIFFICULTIES ENTAILED BY THE APPLICATION OF THE DIRECTIVE IN THE MEMBER STATE CONCERNED .   FINALLY , THE DIRECTIVE ALLOWED THE MEMBER STATES A PERIOD OF MONTHS FOR THE ADOPTION OF IMPLEMENTING MEASURES . THE PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS LAID DOWN IN THE REASONED OPINION MERELY CONSTITUTES AN ADDITIONAL PERIOD IN WHICH THE MEMBER STATE IS INVITED TO PUT AN END TO THE FAILURE WITH WHICH IT     IS CHARGED . FURTHER , THE COMMISSION WAITED ALMOST TWO YEARS AFTER SENDING THE REASONED OPINION BEFORE BRINGING THE MATTER BEFORE THE COURT . IT IS THEREFORE FUTILE FOR THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCE TO CHALLENGE THE PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS LAID DOWN IN THE REASONED OPINION .   THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT FURTHER SUBMITS THAT THE ACTION IS UNFOUNDED BECAUSE THE PERIOD OF MONTHS FOR IMPLEMENTING THE DIRECTIVE IS PATENTLY INADEQUATE . IT ALSO ARGUES THAT COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 77/RAISES PROBLEMS OF INTERPRETATION WITH REGARD TO THE VERY NATURE OF THE OBLIGATIONS WHICH IT IMPOSES UPON MEMBER STATES AND THE DIRECTLY APPLICABLE NATURE OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS .   IN THAT RESPECT ATTENTION SHOULD BE DRAWN TO THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE MEMBER STATES PARTICIPATE IN THE PREPARATORY WORK FOR DIRECTIVES AND MUST THEREFORE BE IN A POSITION TO PREPARE WITHIN THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED THE LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS NECESSARY FOR THEIR IMPLEMENTATION . IF , NEVERTHELESS , THE PERIOD ALLOWED FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A DIRECTIVE PROVES TO BE TOO SHORT , THE ONLY MEANS OF ACTION COMPATIBLE WITH COMMUNITY LAW AVAILABLE TO THE MEMBER STATE CONCERNED CONSISTS IN TAKING THE APPROPRIATE INITIATIVES WITHIN THE COMMUNITY IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY EXTENSION OF THE PERIOD BY THE COMPETENT COMMUNITY INSTITUTION .   AS FOR THE DIFFICULTIES IN INTERPRETING THE DIRECTIVE , THEY CANNOT HAVE BEEN SUCH AS TO SANCTION THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT IN EXCEEDING THE PERIODS IT HAD ACCEPTED , ESPECIALLY AS IT HAD OTHER MEANS TO ENABLE IT TO DETERMINE THE SCOPE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS .   MOREOVER , EVEN IF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE DIRECTIVE WERE DIRECTLY APPLICABLE , THAT DOES NOT EXEMPT THE BELGIAN STATE FROM ITS OBLIGATION OF IMPLEMENTING THE DIRECTIVE BY ADOPTING NATIONAL PROVISIONS . AS THE COURT HAS ALREADY OBSERVED IN THE JUDGMENT OF MAY IN CASE 102/( COMMISSION V BELGIUM ( ) ECR ), THE RIGHT OF PERSONS AFFECTED TO RELY IN LAW ON A DIRECTIVE AS AGAINST THE DEFAULTING MEMBER STATE CONSTITUTES A MINIMUM GUARANTEE ARISING FROM THE BINDING NATURE OF THE OBLIGATION IMPOSED ON MEMBER STATES BY THE EFFECT OF DIRECTIVES UNDER THE THIRD PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE AND CANNOT JUSTIFY A MEMBER STATE ' S ABSOLVING ITSELF FROM TAKING     IN DUE TIME IMPLEMENTING MEASURES SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE PURPOSE OF EACH DIRECTIVE .   FINALLY , IN ITS STATEMENT OF DEFENCE THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT OBSERVES THAT THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE DIRECTIVE ARE ALREADY SATISFIED IN NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS PROPERLY SO CALLED OR IN ADMINISTRATIVE RULES OF A GENERAL NATURE WHICH HAVE RECEIVED SUFFICIENT PUBLICITY . IN ITS REJOINDER THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT STATES THAT THOSE PROVISIONS CANNOT BE REGARDED SIMPLY AS ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES BUT ARE IN FACT ADMINISTRATIVE RULES . IT WAS ONLY AFTER A REQUEST ADDRESSED TO IT BY THE COURT THAT THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT LODGED , ON OCTOBER , AT THE COURT REGISTRY A DOCUMENT TO WHICH WERE ANNEXED THE VARIOUS NATIONAL PROVISIONS WHICH , IN ITS VIEW , ENSURE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DIRECTIVE IN BELGIAN LAW .   HOWEVER , THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT INVOKED THAT ARGUMENT ONLY DURING THE COURSE OF THE ACTION BEFORE THE COURT AND CONFINED ITSELF DURING THE PROCEDURE PRIOR TO ACTION TO STATING THAT FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMPLEMENTING THE DIRECTIVE IN QUESTION LEGISLATION WAS IN PREPARATION .   THAT MANNER OF PROCEEDING DOES NOT COMPLY WITH THE OBLIGATION IMPOSED BY ARTICLE ( ) OF DIRECTIVE 77/, WHICH REQUIRES MEMBER STATES IMMEDIATELY TO SUPPLY THE COMMISSION WITH ALL NECESSARY INFORMATION CONCERNING THE MEASURES WHICH HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO COMPLY WITH THE DIRECTIVE .   HOWEVER , THE ACTION BROUGHT BY THE COMMISSION SEEKS SOLELY A FINDING THAT THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY ' ' BY FAILING TO BRING INTO FORCE WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 77/780/EEC ' '  AND THUS DOES NOT CONCERN THE OBLIGATION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE TO SUPPLY INFORMATION . IT IS THUS WITHIN THOSE LIMITS THAT THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENTS ' S SUBMISSION MUST BE ANSWERED .   THE SUBMISSION MUST NEVERTHELESS BE REJECTED . VARIOUS CLEAR BREACHES OF THE DIRECTIVE MAY BE CITED HERE BY WAY OF EXAMPLE . IN THE FIRST PLACE , THERE APPEARS TO BE NO LAW AT PRESENT IN FORCE EMBODYING VARIOUS OBLIGATIONS ,     IMPOSED INTER ALIA BY ARTICLES ( ), ( ) AND ( ) OF THE DIRECTIVE , TO NOTIFY DECISIONS TAKEN BY THE BELGIAN SUPERVISORY AUTHORITIES .   AS REGARDS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE OBLIGATION UPON THE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES OF THE MEMBER STATES TO SUPPLY ONE ANOTHER WITH ALL INFORMATION LIKELY TO FACILITATE SUPERVISION OF CREDIT INSTITUTIONS ( ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE ), THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM SUBMITS THAT SUCH AN OBLIGATION IS LAID DOWN BY ARTICLE OF ROYAL DECREE NO OF JULY . IT IS TRUE THAT THAT ARTICLE RELEASES MEMBERS OF THE BANKING COMMISSION AND AUDITORS FROM THE DUTY OF PROFESSIONAL SECRECY WHICH BINDS THEM WHEN THEY COMMUNICATE INFORMATION TO A FOREIGN SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY , BUT IT IMPOSES NO OBLIGATION ON THE BELGIAN AUTHORITIES TO COLLABORATE WITH THE AUTHORITIES OF THE OTHER MEMBER STATES .   FURTHERMORE , THE DOCUMENT SUPPLIED BY THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT MENTION ANY PROVISION IMPLEMENTING ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE RELATING TO THE RIGHT OF BRANCHES OF CREDIT INSTITUTIONS TO USE THE SAME NAME AS THEY USE IN THE MEMBER STATE IN WHICH THEIR HEAD OFFICE IS SITUATED . FINALLY , CERTAIN PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF AUTHORIZATION ( ARTICLE ) DO NOT HAVE ANY EQUIVALENT IN BELGIAN LAW . THAT IS TRUE OF THE PROVISION WHICH EMPOWERS THE AUTHORITIES TO WITHDRAW AUTHORIZATION IF THE INSTITUTION DOES NOT CARRY ON BUSINESS WITHIN MONTHS .   IT IS THEREFORE PROPER TO DECLARE THAT , BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 77/OF DECEMBER , THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY .
