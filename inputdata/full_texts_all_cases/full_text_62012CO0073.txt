                  offence of illegal stay — Possibility of substituting the fine with an order for expulsion with immediate effect for a period
                  of at least five years or with a home detention (‘permanenza domiciliare’) sentence — Obligations of the Member States during

Operative part
The reference for a preliminary ruling from the Giudice di Pace di Revere (Italy), by decision of January 2012, is clearly
         inadmissible.
