Reference for a preliminary ruling – Consiglio di Stato – Interpretation of Articles and 81(1) EC and Directive 98/5/EC
                  of the European Parliament and of the Council of February to facilitate practice of the profession of lawyer on a
                  permanent basis in a Member State other than that in which the qualification was obtained (OJ L 77, p. 36) – Fixing by
                  a national professional organisation of mandatory tariffs for lawyers’ services subject to ministerial approval – National
                  rules prohibiting judges in decisions on costs from derogating from the set minimum fees.
               
Operative part
1.
	Articles EC and EC do not preclude a national law which in principle prohibits derogation from minimum fees approved
                     by ministerial decree, on the basis of a draft drawn up by a professional body of lawyers such as the Consiglia nazionale
                     forense, and which also prohibits the court, when it decides the amount of costs that the unsuccessful party must pay to the
                     other party, from derogating from those minimum fees.
                  
2.
	The third question referred by the Consiglio di Stato by decision of January is manifestly inadmissible.
