Grounds
By orders of April (C-330/99), May (C-336/99) and June (C-279/99, C-293/and C-296/99), received at the Court on July (C-279/99), August (C-293/99), August (C-296/99), September (C-330/99) and September (C-336/99), the Commissione Tributaria di Primo Grado di Trento (Tax Court of First Instance, Trento) referred to the Court for a preliminary ruling pursuant to Article EC a question on the interpretation of Council Directive 69/335/EEC of July concerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital (OJ, English Special Edition (II), p. 412), as amended by Council Directive 85/303/EEC of June (OJ L 156, p. 23) (hereinafter the Directive).That question was raised in the course of proceedings between certain companies established in Italy and the Italian tax authorities concerning applications for reimbursement of sums paid by way of tax on companies' net assets.The Directive is aimed in particular at achieving harmonisation of the factors involved in the fixing and levying of capital duty in the Community, by means of the elimination of tax obstacles which interfere with the free movement of capital (see Case C-4/Nonwoven v Direzione Regionale delle Entrate per la Toscana [1998] ECR I-6469, paragraph 3).Article 4(1) of the Directive specifies the transactions which must be subject to capital duty and Article 4(2) lists other transactions which may be subject to that duty.Article of the Directive specifies the transactions in respect of which no taxes may be charged apart from capital duty. These include the transactions referred to in Article 4.Decree-Law No of September (Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica Italiana, No of September 1992) introduced into the Italian tax system a tax on companies' net assets. Those subject to this tax include capital companies, cooperative companies, mutual insurance companies, public and private bodies which are not companies but which have as their exclusive and/or main purpose the exercise of commercial activities, as well as natural persons engaged in activities generating corporate revenue (see Nonwoven, paragraph 9).The basis of assessment of the tax consists of the net assets, as set out in the end-of-year balance sheet, less the profits for that year, the assets comprising various elements, including in particular subscribed capital, even if not yet paid up (see Nonwoven, paragraph 10).The applicants in the main proceedings were required to pay the tax on companies' net assets in respect of various periods of assessment in the years to 1997. After applying to the tax authorities for reimbursement of the tax, and failing to receive any response from that authority, they raised proceedings in the national court between July and June against the implied decisions of rejection of their applications.On October 1998, the Court of Justice gave its judgment in Nonwoven, in which it ruled that the Directive did not preclude the levying on capital companies of a tax such as the tax on companies' net assets.In the national court, the applicants in the main proceedings contend that that answer, given to a question formulated in general terms, raises issues of detail as regards the inclusion, specifically, of subscribed capital within the basis of assessment of the tax. They maintain that in so far as it extends to subscribed capital the tax in question constitutes a duty on capital, or, at least, has an effect equivalent to a new duty on capital, contrary to the prohibition laid down by the Directive.Having regard to the submissions made to it, the Tax Court of First Instance, Trento, decided to stay the proceedings before it and to refer the following question, formulated in identical terms in each of five orders, to the Court for a preliminary ruling:Is it compatible with Community law, and in particular with Directive 69/355/EEC, to tax over a period of years at the rate of 0.75% per annum pursuant to Decree-Law No of September that part of the net assets consisting solely of a company's capital disclosed annually by the balance sheet which has already borne capital duty at the rate of 1%?By order of the President of the Court of September 1999, the five actions were joined for the purposes of the written and oral procedure and of giving judgment.It must be observed at the outset that the answer to the question referred may be clearly deduced from the Court's existing case-law, and thus the Court may give its decision by reasoned order pursuant to Article 104(3) of the Rules of Procedure.At paragraph of its judgment in Nonwoven, the Court decided that a tax on assets, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, does not presuppose any transaction involving the movement of capital or assets and thus does not correspond to any of the taxable transactions mentioned in Article of the Directive, to which Article refers.At paragraph of the same judgment, the Court held that, while it is true that the base of the tax at issue takes into account the amount of capital subscribed, which must or may be subject to capital duty, that capital is only one component of a company's net assets; the tax base consists of the sum of several accounting items, including reserves or funds as well as profits carried over from previous years and losses, both those of the current financial year and those of previous financial years.Having regard to these matters, the Court ruled, at paragraph of its judgment in Nonwoven, that a tax such as that at issue in the main proceedings is neither a capital duty nor a tax having the same characteristics as such a duty.It is plain from the grounds of that judgment that the decision took account of the inclusion of company capital in the basis of assessment of the tax.It may therefore be clearly taken from the Nonwoven judgment that there is no need to extract company capital from the basis of assessment and to treat it differently from the other elements of the latter.In those circumstances, the question referred may be answered by stating that the Directive does not preclude the levying on capital companies of a tax such as the tax on companies' net assets, even where the tax relates to that part of the net assets which consists of the company's capital as recorded annually in the balance sheet. 
Decision on costs
CostsThe costs incurred by the Italian Government and by the Commission, which have submitted observations to the Court, are not recoverable. Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main action, a step in the proceedings pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. 
Operative part
On those grounds,THE COURT (First Chamber),in answer to the question referred to it by the Commissione Tributaria di Primo Grado di Trento by orders of April, May and June 1999, hereby rules:Council Directive 69/335/EEC of July concerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital, as amended by Council Directive 85/303/EEC of June 1985, does not preclude the levying on capital companies of a tax such as the tax on companies' net assets, even where the tax relates to that part of the net assets which consists of the company's capital as recorded annually in the balance sheet.
