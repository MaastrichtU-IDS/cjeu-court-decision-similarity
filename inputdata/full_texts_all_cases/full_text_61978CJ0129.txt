Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE EXPRESSION ' ' LEGISLATION ' '  APPEARING IN ARTICLE ( J ) AND ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/OF THE COUNCIL OF THE EEC OF JUNE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P . ), 
Grounds
1BY AN ORDER DATED JUNE , WHICH REACHED THE COURT ON JUNE , THE CENTRALE RAAD VAN BEROEP ( COURT OF LAST INSTANCE IN SOCIAL SECURITY MATTERS ) DECIDED TO REFER TWO QUESTIONS TO THE COURT IN THE CONTEXT OF PROCEEDINGS PENDING BEFORE IT . THOSE PROCEEDINGS INVOLVED A NETHERLANDS NATIONAL , A FORMER LOCAL OFFICIAL IN THE NETHERLANDS , WHO SINCE MAY HAD BEEN DRAWING AN INVALIDITY PENSION IN PURSUANCE OF THE NETHERLANDS LAW ON PENSIONS FOR OFFICIALS . THE PERSON CONCERNED MOVED TO BELGIUM AND THEN ASKED THE COMPETENT NETHERLANDS INSTITUTION TO GRANT HIM FAMILY ALLOWANCES IN RESPECT OF A DAUGHTER WHO HAD REMAINED IN THE NETHERLANDS . HE RECEIVED A NEGATIVE ANSWER SINCE ACCORDING TO THE INSTITUTION THE RESIDENCE CONDITION PRESCRIBED BY ARTICLE ( ) OF THE LAW ON FAMILY ALLOWANCES FOR CHILDREN OF WAGE-EARNERS AND PERSONS TREATED AS SUCH WAS NOT FULFILLED . THE CENTRALE RAAD VAN BEROEP THEREUPON DECIDED TO REFER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS TO THE COURT :  ' ' DOES THE FACT THAT ARTICLE ( J ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/REFERS ONLY TO PARAGRAPHS ( ) AND ( ) OF ARTICLE SIGNIFY THAT THE LIMITATION CONTAINED IN PARAGRAPH ( ) OF THAT ARTICLE DOES NOT RELATE TO THE MEANING OF THE TERM ' LEGISLATION '  WHERE THE TERM IS USED ELSEWHERE IN THE REGULATION?   IN CONNEXION WITH THE ANSWER TO THE PREVIOUS QUESTION OR INDEPENDENTLY THEREOF , MUST ' PENSION UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF ONE MEMBER STATE ONLY '  IN ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/ALSO INCLUDE PENSIONS PAYABLE UNDER A SPECIAL SCHEME FOR CIVIL SERVANTS AND PERSONS TREATED AS SUCH?  ' '  FIRST QUESTION   2UNDER ARTICLE ( J ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/, THE EXPRESSION ' ' LEGISLATION ' '  MEANS ALL THE LAWS , REGULATIONS AND OTHER PROVISIONS AND ALL OTHER PRESENT OR FUTURE IMPLEMENTING MEASURES OF EACH MEMBER STATE RELATING TO THE SECTORS OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND SCHEMES FOR SOCIAL SECURITY COVERED BY ARTICLE ( ) AND ( ) OF THE SAID REGULATION . REFERENCE IS THUS MADE TO THE POSITIVE DEFINITION OF THE MATERIAL SCOPE OF THE REGULATION .   3THE ABSENCE OF AN EXPRESS REFERENCE IN ARTICLE ( J ) TO ARTICLE ( ) IS EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NO NEED TO DEFINE NEGATIVELY THE MATERIAL SCOPE OF THE REGULATION BY REPEATING THE EXPRESS EXCLUSION OF SPECIAL SCHEMES FOR CIVIL SERVANTS AND PERSONS TREATED AS SUCH . MOREOVER THAT EXCLUSION IS ONLY THE LOGICAL CONSEQUENCE OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TREATY WHICH EXCLUDES ' ' EMPLOYMENT IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE ' '  FROM THE APPLICATION OF THE PROVISIONS RELATING TO FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT FOR WORKERS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY .   4THE ANSWER TO BE GIVEN TO THE FIRST QUESTION PUT BY THE CENTRALE RAAD VAN BEROEP SHOULD THEREFORE BE THAT THE FACT THAT ARTICLE ( J ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/REFERS ONLY TO ARTICLE ( ) AND ( ) DOES NOT REMOVE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE LIMITATION CONTAINED IN PARAGRAPH ( ) OF THAT ARTICLE .  SECOND QUESTION   5ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/USES THE CONCEPT OF ' ' A PENSION UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF ONE MEMBER STATE ONLY ' ' . THE EXPRESSION ' ' LEGISLATION ' '  USED IN THAT PROVISION HAS THE SCOPE DEFINED IN ARTICLE ( J ) OF THE REGULATION AS EXPLAINED IN ANSWER TO THE FIRST QUESTION .   6THE ANSWER TO BE GIVEN TO THE SECOND QUESTION OF THE CENTRALE RAAD VAN BEROEP SHOULD THEREFORE BE THAT A PENSION UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF ONE MEMBER STATE ONLY WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/DOES NOT INCLUDE A PENSION GRANTED UNDER A SPECIAL SCHEME FOR CIVIL SERVANTS OR PERSONS TREATED AS SUCH .
