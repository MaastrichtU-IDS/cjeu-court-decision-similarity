Re: 
Appeal brought against the order of the Court of First Instance (Third Chamber) of September in Case T-166/Ivanov 
v
 Commission
, by which that court dismissed the action brought by the appellant seeking compensation for the damage he allegedly suffered
                  following a Commission decision refusing to recruit him as a local administrative and technical assistance employee at the

                  annulment – Reservation of abuse of process – Possible for the Court of First Instance to have raised that rule of its own
                  motion.
