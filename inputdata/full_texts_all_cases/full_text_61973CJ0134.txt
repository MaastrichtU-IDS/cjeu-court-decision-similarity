Subject of the case
IN THE MATTER, AT THE PRESENT STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS, OF THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE ACTION FOR FAILURE TO ACT BROUGHT BY THE HOLTZ UNDERTAKING AGAINST THE COUNCIL AND THE COMMISSION FOR HAVING ALLEGEDLY INFRINGED THE EEC TREATY BY OMITTING, IN THE CASE OF THE COUNCIL, TO ADOPT A DECISION GRANTING AN ADDITIONAL SUBSIDY FOR COLZA AND RAPE SEED PROCESSED IN OIL MILLS SITUATED IN THE LAND OF NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA, AS HAS BEEN DONE FOR ITALIAN OIL MILLS BY REGULATION NO 1336/72/EEC, OF JUNE ( OJ L OF JUNE ) AND, IN THE CASE OF THE COMMISSION, TO SUBMIT PROPOSALS TO THE COUNCIL TO THIS EFFECT, 
Grounds
BY AN ACTION COMMENCED ON MAY 1973, BASED ON ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY, THE APPLICANT COMPLAINS THAT THE COUNCIL HAS FAILED TO ENACT A REGULATION RELATING TO AN ADDITIONAL SUBSIDY FOR COLZA AND RAPE SEED PROCESSED IN OIL MILLS FAR FROM THE PRODUCTION AREAS .  IN ADDITION, THE APPLICANT COMPLAINS THAT THE COMMISSION HAS FAILED TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL TO THE COUNCIL TO THIS EFFECT .  AS THE COUNCIL AND THE COMMISSION REQUESTED THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE COURT DECIDED TO GIVE A RULING ON THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THIS ACTION WITHOUT DEALING WITH THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CASE .  IN ADDITION TO THE AID GRANTED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN OILS AND FATS, THERE WAS SET UP, AS FROM THE 1967/MARKETING YEAR, AN ADDITIONAL SUBSIDY WHOSE PURPOSE WAS TO LESSEN CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED BY ITALIAN OIL MILLS AND WHICH WAS RENEWED FOR THE 1972/MARKETING YEAR BY REGULATION NO 1336/OF JUNE ( OJ L OF JUNE 1972, P . ).  CONTENDING THAT THIS ADDITIONAL SUBSIDY CONSTITUTES A DISCRIMINATION PROHIBITED BY ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY, THE APPLICANT, BY A LETTER OF JANUARY 1973, CALLED UPON THE COUNCIL 'IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY TO ENACT A REGULATION CONCERNING AN ADDITIONAL SUBSIDY FOR COLZA AND RAPE SEED PROCESSED IN OIL MILLS FAR FROM THE PRODUCTION AREAS '.  THE APPLICANT ADDED THAT 'THIS REGULATION SHOULD NO LONGER TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE FACT THAT AN OIL MILL IS SITUATED ON THE TERRITORY OF A PARTICULAR MEMBER STATE' BUT 'INSTEAD SHOULD GRANT THIS ADDITIONAL SUBSIDY IN PROGRESSIVE SLICES ACCORDING TO THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE OIL MILL AND THE PRODUCTION AREAS '.  BY LETTER OF THE SAME DATE THE APPLICANT INFORMED THE COMMISSION OF THE CONTENTS OF THE ONE IT SENT TO THE COUNCIL AND IT BEGGED THE COMMISSION 'TO MAKE USE OF ITS RIGHT OF INITIATIVE AND TO SUBMIT AN APPROPRIATE PROPOSAL TO THE COUNCIL '.  BY A LETTER OF MARCH THE COUNCIL REPLIED TO THE APPLICANT THAT IT WAS OF THE OPINION THAT THE REGULATIONS ESTABLISHING AN ADDITIONAL SUBSIDY FOR COLZA AND RAPE SEED PROCESSED IN ITALY WERE IN CONFORMITY WITH THE EEC TREATY .  BY A LETTER OF MARCH THE COMMISSION REPLIED TO THE APPLICANT THAT ITS APPLICATION WAS BEING EXAMINED CLOSELY BY ITS DEPARTMENTS .  IN ITS ACTION THE APPLICANT DREW ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT 'THE COUNCIL, IN INFRINGEMENT OF THE TREATY, HAS FAILED TO ENACT A REGULATION FOR AN ADDITIONAL SUBSIDY FOR COLZA AND RAPE SEED PROCESSED IN OIL MILLS FAR FROM THE PRODUCTION AREAS AND PROVIDING, INTER ALIA, IN THE CASE OF AN OIL MILL SITUATED IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY IN THE LAND OF NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA, FOR THE PAYMENT OF AN ADDITIONAL SUBSIDY OF 0.U.A . PER KG OF COLZA AND RAPE SEED '.  BY THE THIRD PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ANY NATURAL OR LEGAL PERSON MAY, UNDER THE CONDITIONS LAID DOWN IN THE FIRST AND SECOND PARAGRAPHS OF THE SAME ARTICLE, COMPLAIN TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE THAT THE COUNCIL OR THE COMMISSION HAS, IN INFRINGEMENT OF THE TREATY, 'FAILED TO ADDRESS TO THAT PERSON ANY ACT OTHER THAN A RECOMMENDATION OR AN OPINION '.  IT APPEARS THAT THE ACTION COMMENCED BY THE APPLICANT HAS THE OBJECT OF PROCURING A PROVISION OF A GENERAL REGULATORY CHARACTER HAVING THE SAME LEGAL SCOPE AS REGULATION NO 1336/72, AND NOT AN ACT CONCERNING IT DIRECTLY AND INDIVIDUALLY .  SUCH A REGULATION CANNOT BE DESCRIBED, BY REASON EITHER OF ITS FORM OR OF ITS NATURE, AS AN ACT ADDRESSED TO THE APPLICANT WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE THIRD PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE .  THE SAME APPLIES IN RESPECT OF THAT PART OF THE ACTION DIRECTED AGAINST THE COMMISSION, AS THE PROPOSAL DEMANDED FROM THE LATTER IS AN INTRINSIC PART OF THE PROCEDURE FOR PREPARATION OF THE REGULATION AND IS THUS NOT CAPABLE OF FALLING IN THE CATEGORY OF ACTS WHICH BY THE THIRD PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE CAN BE ADDRESSED TO THE APPLICANT .  THE ACTION MUST THEREFORE BE DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE .
