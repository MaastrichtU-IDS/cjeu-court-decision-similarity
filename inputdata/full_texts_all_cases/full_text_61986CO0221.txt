Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR AN ORDER SUSPENDING THE OPERATION OF THE DECISION OF THE ENLARGED BUREAU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT DATED JULY ON THE ALLOCATION OF THE APPROPRIATIONS ENTERED UNDER ITEM OF THE GENERAL BUDGET OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR IN CONNECTION WITH THE ' INFORMATION CAMPAIGNS '  IN SPAIN AND PORTUGAL , 
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON AUGUST THE GROUP OF THE EUROPEAN RIGHT AND THE NATIONAL FRONT PARTY BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE DECISION OF THE ENLARGED BUREAU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT DATED JULY ON THE ALLOCATION OF THE APPROPRIATIONS ENTERED UNDER ITEM OF THE GENERAL BUDGET OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES IS VOID .  ITEM APPEARS IN THE GENERAL BUDGET OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR IN THE SECTION CONCERNING THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AT CHAPTER IN TITLE , WHICH COVERS EXPENDITURE RESULTING FROM SPECIAL FUNCTIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE INSTITUTION ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ). ITEM WAS INITIALLY HEADED ' CONTRIBUTION TO THE COSTS OF PREPARATIONS FOR THE NEXT EUROPEAN ELECTIONS ' , BUT THAT HEADING WAS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED TO READ ' EUROPEAN INFORMATION CAMPAIGN '  ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ). ACCORDING TO THE REMARKS CONCERNING THE ITEM , OF THE TOTAL ENTERED AGAINST IT , NAMELY ECU , ECU IS EXCLUSIVELY INTENDED FOR THE INFORMATION CAMPAIGN FOR THE FIRST DIRECT ELECTIONS TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT IN SPAIN AND PORTUGAL . IT IS ALSO STATED THAT THAT AMOUNT IS TO BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME ARRANGEMENTS FOR MONITORING ITS UTILIZATION AS THOSE ADOPTED FOR THE AMOUNTS ENTERED AGAINST ITEM FOR THE INFORMATION CAMPAIGN FOR THE EUROPEAN ELECTIONS .  ON JULY , THE ENLARGED BUREAU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ADOPTED THE CONTESTED DECISION ON A PROPOSAL MOVED BY THE COMMUNIST GROUP . THAT PROPOSAL APPLIES THE SAME PRINCIPLES AS THE PROPOSAL ALREADY ADOPTED BY THE ENLARGED BUREAU FOR ITEM IN CONNECTION WITH THE GENERAL FUNDS , NAMELY , THE ALLOCATION OF A FIXED AMOUNT WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE SIZE OF THE GROUPS AND OF AN AMOUNT WHICH IS STRICTLY PROPORTIONATE TO THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS CONCERNED IN EACH GROUP . IT IS FURTHER STATED THAT SINCE THE APPROPRIATIONS IN QUESTION ARE INTENDED SPECIFICALLY FOR INFORMATION IN SPAIN AND PORTUGAL , THE MEMBERS CONCERNED ARE THE SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE MEMBERS IN EACH GROUP AND THAT THEIR NUMBER CONSTITUTES THE BASIS FOR CALCULATING THE PROPORTIONATE ALLOCATION . THE APPLICATION OF THOSE PRINCIPLES RESULTED IN THE APPLICANTS BEING ALLOCATED A FIXED AMOUNT OF ECU . HOWEVER , THEY WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE PROPORTIONATE DISTRIBUTION OF THE REMAINING FUNDS SINCE THOSE FUNDS WERE RESTRICTED TO GROUPS WHICH ALREADY INCLUDED SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE MEMBERS .  BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON SEPTEMBER , THE APPLICANTS APPLIED , PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY , ARTICLE OF THE PROTOCOL ON THE STATUTE OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EEC AND ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE , FOR AN ORDER SUSPENDING THE OPERATION OF THE DECISION OF THE ENLARGED BUREAU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT DATED JULY UNTIL THE COURT HAS GIVEN JUDGMENT IN THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS .  IN REPLY TO A QUESTION WHICH WAS PUT TO IT ON SEPTEMBER BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT AND WHICH WAS INTENDED TO ESTABLISH WHETHER THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT HAD ALREADY TAKEN STEPS TO IMPLEMENT THE DECISION OF JULY , OR WHETHER IT INTENDED TO DO SO BEFORE AN ORDER HAD BEEN MADE TERMINATING THESE INTERLOCUTORY PROCEEDINGS , THE DEFENDANT STATED , IN ITS REPLY DATED SEPTEMBER , THAT FOLLOWING THE APPROVAL OF THE MINUTES OF THE ENLARGED BUREAU OF AND JULY , GIVEN ON SEPTEMBER , THE COMPETENT DEPARTMENTS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT HAD BEEN AUTHORIZED , BY A MEMORANDUM OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL DATED SEPTEMBER , TO CARRY OUT THE PAYMENTS OF THE APPROPRIATIONS ENTERED UNDER ITEM TO THE POLITICAL GROUPS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BASIS FOR ALLOCATION WHICH HAD BEEN ADOPTED BY THE ENLARGED BUREAU AT ITS MEETING ON JULY . IT FURTHER STATED THAT BY SEPTEMBER THE FOLLOWING PAYMENTS HAD BEEN MADE :   POLITICAL GROUPS SUMS PAID SPPE ED COM LDR RDE DR MOREOVER , AT THE REQUEST OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT , THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT INDICATED THE EXACT DATE ON WHICH ITS FINANCIAL DEPARTMENTS HAD EFFECTED THE TRANSFERS TO THE BANK ACCOUNTS OF THE POLITICAL GROUPS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DECISION OF JULY . IT APPEARS FROM THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE PARLIAMENT THAT IN THE CASE OF THE SOCIALIST GROUP THE TRANSFER WAS MADE ON SEPTEMBER . FOR THE TRANSFERS TO THE OTHER POLITICAL GROUPS THE PARLIAMENT ' S REPLY CONSISTED MERELY OF THE WORDS ' IDEM SOCIALIST GROUP EXCEPT FOR DATE OF PAYMENT ' ; IT DID NOT SUPPLY ANY INFORMATION FROM WHICH IT WAS POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE DATES ON WHICH THE TRANSFERS HAD BEEN MADE .  IT WOULD THEREFORE SEEM THAT BY EFFECTING THOSE TRANSFERS THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT PROCEEDED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DECISION OF JULY IN RESPECT OF A LARGE PART OF THE APPROPRIATIONS IN QUESTION DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT WAS FULLY AWARE THAT INTERLOCUTORY PROCEEDINGS HAD BEEN INSTITUTED WITH A VIEW TO OBTAINING THE SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF THAT DECISION .  ACCORDING TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT MAY GRANT AN APPLICATION FOR INTERIM MEASURES EVEN BEFORE THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE OPPOSITE PARTY HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED . THAT DECISION MAY BE VARIED OR CANCELLED EVEN WITHOUT ANY APPLICATION BEING MADE BY ANY PARTY .  IN THIS INSTANCE , IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE INTERLOCUTORY PROCEEDINGS ARE NOT DEPRIVED OF THEIR SUBSTANCE AND THEIR EFFECT , IT WOULD SEEM NECESSARY , IN THE INTERESTS OF THE PROPER ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE , AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE , TO SUSPEND THE OPERATION OF THE DECISION OF JULY UNTIL AN ORDER HAS BEEN MADE TERMINATING THESE INTERLOCUTORY PROCEEDINGS .  SINCE THAT DECISION HAS ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED TO A LARGE EXTENT INASMUCH AS ECU OF THE TOTAL APPROPRIATION AVAILABLE OF ECU HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT TO THE VARIOUS POLITICAL GROUPS , THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT MUST TAKE ALL THE NECESSARY STEPS TO ENSURE THAT THE POLITICAL GROUPS WITHIN THE PARLIAMENT TO WHICH THE SUMS REFERRED TO IN PARAGRAPH OF THIS ORDER HAVE BEEN PAID CANNOT DISPOSE OF THOSE SUMS UNTIL AN ORDER HAS BEEN MADE TERMINATING THESE INTERLOCUTORY PROCEEDINGS .
