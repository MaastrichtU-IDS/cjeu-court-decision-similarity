Grounds
By application lodged at the Court Registry on February 1998, the Commission of the European Communities brought an action pursuant to an arbitration clause based on Article of the EC Treaty (now Article EC) against Tecnologie Vetroresina SpA (hereinafter TVR) for, first, reimbursement of the sum of ECU advanced by the Commission under Contract No 3440/1/0/187/91/6/BCR-I(30) (hereinafter the contract), together with interest as provided for in the contract, namely ECU 69.per day from December and, second, damages of ECU in respect of the harm sustained by the Commission.The contract was concluded on August between the European Economic Community, represented by the Commission, of the one part, and TVR and an English university, Brunel University (hereinafter Brunel), of the other part, within the framework of the financial support granted on the basis of the research and development programme for the Community in the field of applied metrology and chemical analysis (to 1992) adopted by Council Decision 88/418/EEC of June (OJ L 206, p. 29).The contract, which was concluded for a period of months from September 1991, was for research into in-line dimensional measurements of composite workpieces produced by filament winding technology. The purpose of the research was to put an end to the high scrap rates and manpower costs associated with that process.Under the contract, TVR was designated as contract coordinator. In that capacity, it was specifically responsible for, inter alia:receiving all payments from the Commission and immediately transferring the appropriate amount to each contractor (Article 4(3) of the contract);sending the Commission the annual cost statements and six-monthly progress reports, within one month from the end of each relevant period, and the consolidated cost statement and final report, within three months and two months respectively of the completion, cessation or termination of the work financed by the Commission (Article 5(1) and (2) and Article 6(1) of the contract, and Articles 6(1) and 36(1) of Annex II thereto).Article 8(2)(d) of Annex II to the contract provides that the Commission may terminate the contract in the event of non-performance by one of the contractors, unless there are reasonable and justifiable technical or economic grounds for such non-performance, after giving notice in writing by recorded delivery or registered post, where the contractor is still in breach of its obligations one month after the receipt thereof.The first subparagraph of Article 8(4) of that annex provides that where Article 8(2)(d) is applied, the Commission may require the reimbursement of all or part of its financial contribution and is to have regard, to such extent as may be fair and reasonable, to the nature and results of the work undertaken and its use to the Commission.Under the second subparagraph of Article 8(4) of Annex II, interest may be payable from the date on which the payments were received by the contractor at the rate applied by the European Monetary Cooperation Fund for its operations in ecus, increased by percentage points, such rate being published in the Official Journal of the European Communities for the first working day of each month.Article of Annex II to the contract provides that the Court of Justice is to have jurisdiction in respect of any dispute concerning the contract, which, pursuant to Article of the contract, is to be governed by Italian law.On September the Commission paid to TVR, by way of advance on the work to be carried out, the sum of ECU 000. Of that amount, ECU was intended for TVR and ECU for Brunel.On March TVR informed the Commission that, while it accepted that it was responsible for transferring the sum of ECU to Brunel, there was some doubt, following a series of misunderstandings, as to whether that sum had been transferred to Brunel. TVR undertook to transfer that sum as quickly as possible in the event that it had not already been transferred.By letter of April the Commission gave TVR notice in writing to send documentary evidence that the transfer had been duly effected. The Commission stated that, in the absence of such evidence, it would terminate the contract and demand reimbursement by TVR of the advance of ECU 000, together with interest at the agreed rate.By two letters of January 1994, the Commission informed TVR that as it had not received the evidence requested it was terminating the contract, and demanded reimbursement of the amount of ECU plus interest at the agreed rate. The Commission also considered that the costs declared by TVR in the cost statements for the period September to May were excessive, and requested TVR to forward the documents necessary to establish their accuracy, failing which it would be required to reimburse to the Commission the advance of ECU 000, together with interest at the agreed rate.On the same date the Commission also terminated its contract with Brunel, which did not have the technical resources to complete the project financed by the Commission on its own.In July 1994, the Commission, which approved only part of the costs indicated by TVR in the cost statements, requested TVR to reimburse the sum of ECU 307, representing the difference between the initial contribution of ECU and half the approved costs, as, pursuant to Article 3(2) of the contract, the Commission was to contribute 50% of the allowable costs.In September 1994, the Commission received an auditor's report in respect of the period September to August 1992, drawn up at its request by Reconta Ernst & Young. That report concluded, first, that there was no evidence that the sum of ECU had been transferred to Brunel and, second, that the labour costs invoiced by TVR were lower than costs actually incurred.By letter of June 1995, the Commission requested TVR to reimburse the sum of ECU 000, plus interest at the agreed rate, representing the contribution intended for but not received by Brunel, and also the sum of ECU representing the amount by which the contribution intended for TVR exceeded the approved costs.TVR has not made any reimbursement.AdmissibilityTVR claims that the Commission's claim is inadmissible. As the Commission has not expressly requested the Court to make a preliminary finding that the contract is terminated, it cannot take advantage of the restitutory effects of termination defined in Article of the Codice Civile (hereinafter the Italian Civil Code), especially as TVR has challenged the termination of the contract by the Commission.The Commission contends that the claim for reimbursement of the sums improperly retained by TVR is based on the termination of the contract by the Commission in accordance with Article 8(2)(d) of Annex II to the contract. Provided that the contract was terminated pursuant to that provision, according to the Commission, the claims for reimbursement of the financial contribution and for damages include by implication an application for a declaration that the contract is terminated.In that regard, it should be pointed out, first, that where the law or the contract provides that the parties may unilaterally terminate the contract for non-performance of a contractual obligation, any party to the contract who has relied on that provision may, where necessary, apply to the court for a declaration that the contract is automatically terminated (see, in that regard, judgments of the Corte Suprema di Cassazione (Supreme Court of Cassation, Italy) of December 1979, No 6489, Mass. Foro It. 1979, p. 1309, and April 1990, No 2802, Mass. Foro It. 1990, p. 406).Second, it should be observed that the Corte Suprema di Cassazione accepts that an unformulated claim may be regarded as being submitted by implication and as inherent in the application initiating the action, provided that it is necessarily linked to the subject-matter and basis of the action (see, in particular, judgment of the Corte Suprema di Cassazione of June 1991, No 6727, Mass. Foro It. 1991, p. 582).In the present case, the Commission states in its application that it relied on the termination clause referred to in Article 8(2)(d) of Annex II to the contract, owing to TVR's non-performance of the contract, and that, proceeding on the basis that the contract had been terminated, it required that TVR produce the documents necessary to establish the amounts received under the contract that TVR had to reimburse. The Commission goes on to state that it requested TVR to reimburse the sums advanced under the contract, apart from the amount allocated to the part of TVR's costs approved by the Commission. On that basis, the Commission requests the Court, in particular, to order TVR, pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 8(4) of Annex II to the contract, to reimburse in part the amounts received by way of financial contribution.As the Commission claims reimbursement in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 8(4) of Annex II to the contract on the ground that the contract was, it contends, terminated following the implementation of the termination procedure provided for in Article 8(2)(d) of Annex II to the contract, its claim necessarily presupposes that the Court will declare that the contract was actually terminated.It is therefore necessary to hold that in the present case the Commission has submitted by implication an application for a declaration that the contract was automatically terminated pursuant to the termination procedure.It follows that the plea of inadmissibility must be rejected.Termination of the contractThe Commission contends that it exercised its right to terminate the contract on the ground that TVR, which had received an advance of ECU 000, which included ECU for Brunel, never transferred that sum to Brunel and was thus in breach of Article 4(3) of the contract. The Commission points out that it first gave TVR notice in writing, by registered letter of April 1993, to make the payment to Brunel and that, when TVR failed to do so, it then terminated the contract by registered letter of January 1994. In its reply, the Commission likewise claims that as TVR did not fulfil its obligation within one month of receiving the letter of April 1993, the contract was automatically terminated upon the expiry of that period. Accordingly, the letter of January merely confirmed that the contract had been terminated.TVR maintains that the conditions which would have justified sending the letter of April giving notice of termination or the declaration that the contract had been terminated contained in the letter of January were not satisfied. In that regard, it states that the total sum of ECU was paid by the Commission by bank transfer to the bank nominated by TVR. That bank credited the amount of ECU to a foreign currency account opened by TVR and retained ECU in order to transfer it to Brunel. However, Brunel never received anything. As the bank retained the ECU without crediting it to TVR's accounts, TVR cannot be ordered to reimburse it, since it never had the sum in question at its disposal.In that regard, it should be pointed out that, as the Commission made a bank transfer of the sum of ECU to the bank nominated by TVR, it properly discharged its obligation to make payment to TVR. For the purposes of the contractual relationship between those two parties, TVR must be considered to have received that amount.Under Article 4(3) of the contract, TVR was required to transfer immediately to Brunel the sum payable to it under the contract.In the present case, it is common ground that the sum which should have been transferred to Brunel, namely ECU 000, was never credited to its account.Accordingly, it must be held that TVR was in breach of its obligation under Article 4(3) of the contract, an obligation which, moreover, was of the essence of the contract.Even supposing that the non-performance of that obligation is, in the context of the relations between TVR and the bank which it had instructed to make the transfer, attributable to the bank, that is immaterial to the contractual relationship between the Commission and TVR, in the context of which TVR was under an obligation to the Commission to transfer the sum of ECU to Brunel. Any negligence on the part of the bank which may have resulted in the transfer not being made cannot preclude TVR's liability to the Commission.In any event, therefore, and contrary to what TVR maintains, the substantive conditions for terminating the contract were satisfied.In the light of the foregoing, it must be held that the contract was terminated at the latest on the day on which TVR received the Commission's letter of January 1994.Reimbursement of the advanceUnder the first subparagraph of Article 8(4) of Annex II to the contract, where the Commission terminates the contract on the ground of non-performance by a contractor of its obligations, it may require the reimbursement of all or part of its financial contribution and is to have regard, to such extent as may be fair and reasonable, to the nature and results of the work undertaken and its use to the Commission.As regards the sum of ECU which TVR should have transferred to Brunel by way of advance on the work to be carried out by Brunel, the Commission claims reimbursement in full.It follows from the foregoing, in particular paragraphs to of the present judgment, that the Commission's claim must be upheld.As regards the claim for reimbursement of the sum of ECU 307, the Commission contends that, having regard to the scientific records, the costs statements and the other information provided by TVR, the expenditure incurred by TVR that should be borne by the Commission comes to ECU 693. Since the Commission made an advance payment of ECU to the applicant, the applicant must therefore be required to reimburse the sum of ECU 307.TVR submits that that claim must be rejected, on the ground that the entire advance of ECU paid by the Commission was used in performing the contract. TVR claims that Reconta Ernst & Young stated in its auditor's report that the working hours invoiced by TVR corresponded in full to the work carried out and its actual cost. According to that report, the cost of the working hour was even undervalued, since it was calculated on the basis of the scale applicable in 1991, not the scale for 1992, the year during which the work was carried out.It should first of all be pointed out that the auditor's report to which TVR refers is in any event of no relevance to the present case. That report relates exclusively to the period September to August 1992, whereas the dispute between the parties concerns the costs associated with the period September to May 1993.Next, as regards the costs associated with the latter period which were not approved by the Commission, TVR has not provided the Court with any evidence capable of calling the Commission's assertions in question. In particular, it has not produced any document itemising the costs incurred with reference to the work undertaken and the list of tasks to be carried out. In essence, TVR has merely produced a summary cost statement for the period September to May 1993.Having regard to the inadequacy of the evidence adduced by the defendant, the claim for reimbursement of ECU must be allowed.InterestThe Commission also claims that TVR should be ordered to pay interest at the agreed rate on the sums of ECU and ECU from December 1991.TVR has submitted no argument on that point.According to the second subparagraph of Article 8(4) of Annex II to the contract, in the event of termination of the contract by the Commission, the party in breach must reimburse not only the sums advanced by the Commission but also interest at the agreed rate on those sums from the date on which payments were received. The rate of interest applicable is the rate applied by the European Monetary Cooperation Fund for its operations in ecus, published on the first working day for each month, increased by percentage points.As it must make reimbursement to the Commission of the total sum of ECU representing its primary obligation, TVR must also discharge its secondary obligation by paying interest at the agreed rate on that sum from December 1991, the date on which it accepts that it received the advance of ECU 000.Compensation for damageRelying on Article of the Italian Civil Code, the Commission also claims that TVR should be ordered to pay the sum of ECU by way of compensation for the damage which the Commission says it has sustained as a result of non-performance of the contract.In that regard, it points out, first, that some of its officials spent a large number of hours monitoring the defendant's activities and requesting from it the periodic reports provided for in the contract. Second, the Commission was obliged to employ the services of a firm of auditors in order to audit TVR's work. Third, the Commission was unable to enjoy the advantages provided for in Article of Annex II to the contract and thus profit from the knowledge acquired through the research which it had funded or from the exploitation of the patents which might have been taken out on that occasion. Fourth, by entering into a contract with a party which did not honour its commitments, the Commission suffered a loss of credibility in the eyes of all those with a potential interest in entering into a contract with it.TVR contends that the Commission has failed to show that it suffered the alleged loss.First of all, it should be pointed out that, under Article of the contract, the contract is to be governed by Italian law.Even supposing that Article of the Italian Civil Code, which provides that a contractor is entitled to demand that the defaulting party compensate it for its loss, applies only where the contract is terminated by the court, the fact remains that, under Article of that code, any party who does not properly discharge his obligations is required to make good any consequent loss unless he can show that his failure to do so was due to force majeure.It is therefore necessary to ascertain whether the Commission has succeeded in establishing that it actually sustained the harm alleged.As regards the costs allegedly caused by the additional work which the Commission's officials were required to perform in administering the contract, it should be pointed out that the combined provisions of Article 4(3) of the contract and Article 8(2)(d) of Annex II thereto gave the Commission the right to take the appropriate steps in due time in consequence the other party's failure to honour its contractual undertakings and to bring the contractual relationship to an end, in advance and unilaterally (see, in that regard, Case C-334/Commission v Montorio [1999] ECR I-3387, paragraph 53).Since the Commission tolerated TVR's failure to honour its commitments over what in the event was quite a long period before terminating the contract, the additional costs of administering the contract during that period do not constitute harm attributable to TVR.As regards the alleged harm represented by the auditor's fees, it is clear from the case-file that, for the period from September to August 1992, covered by the audit, the Commission was in a position, even before receiving the auditor's report, to allow virtually all the costs recorded by TVR. It is also clear from the case-file that several months before instructing Reconta Ernst & Young to carry out the audit, the Commission had told TVR that its revised cost statement for the abovementioned period appeared to be acceptable from the technical point of view. In those circumstances, the auditor's fees cannot in any event be attributed to TVR.As regards the other heads of damage formulated by the Commission, it has adduced no specific and persuasive evidence to substantiate them.The Commission's claim for damages must therefore be dismissed.Pursuant to Article 2(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1103/of June on certain provisions relating to the introduction of the euro (OJ L 162, p. 1), the reference to the ecu must be replaced by a reference to the euro at a rate of one euro to one ecu. 
Decision on costs
CostsUnder Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party's pleadings. Since the Commission has applied for costs and TVR has been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to pay the costs 
Operative part
On those grounds,THE COURT (Sixth Chamber)hereby:1. Orders Tecnologie Vetroresina SpA (TVR) to pay the Commission of the European Communities the sum of EUR 307, together with interest at the agreed rate from December until the debt is paid in full;2. Dismisses the remainder of the application;3. Orders Tecnologie Vetroresina SpA (TVR) to pay the costs.
