Summary
. Article 58() of the ECSC Treaty empowers the Commission to adjust the ratio between the production quotas and the proportion of those quotas which may be delivered in the common market if a particularly unfavourable development on the export market makes such adjustment necessary in order to ensure an allocation of those quotas on an equitable basis . By failing, when it adopted the decisions extending the quota system, to undertake an alteration of that ratio which the Commission itself considered necessary in view of the situation on the export markets and of that of the undertakings concerned, the Commission pursued a purpose different from that laid down for it by the aforesaid article ( see judgment of July in Joined Cases 33, 44, 110, and 285/Peine-Salzgitter and Others v Commission ( ) ECR ). Article of Decision 194/is therefore vitiated by misuse of powers and must be declared void .  Such is also the case as regards Decision 1433/and Article of Decision 194/which, although they adjust the said ratio by authorizing the conversion of part of the production quotas into delivery quotas, do not however correspond to what, on the Commission' s own admission, was necessary in order to ensure an equitable allocation .  . Since the system of production and delivery quotas for steel is founded on a cooperative effort by the undertakings to meet the crisis caused by the reduction in demand, it is not accompanied by any guarantee against the consequences of the options chosen by the undertakings prior to its introduction ( see judgments of July in Case 119/Kloeckner-Werke v Commission (( )) ECR and of May in Case 244/Kloeckner-Werke v Commission (( )) ECR ). Under that system the inevitable result of the transfers of references from one category to another, authorized by the successive general decisions on the matter, was a change in the relative market position of the undertakings in the categories of products affected by the transfers .  Monoproducers who cannot, like the producers who manufacture more than one product, have recourse to those transfers or can do so only to a very limited extent are in a special situation . That situation justifies the derogation from the general system of quotas, a derogation which Article 6() of Decision 194/established in favour of those producers by providing that the Commission is to grant them the necessary adjustments if, as a result of transfers of references, it finds that their relative market position has deteriorated .  No such justification exists in the case of undertakings which do not satisfy the special conditions that are characteristic of the situation of the monoproducer, so that the Commission was under no obligation to extend the guarantee of the relative market position to undertakings 90% of whose total reference production is in two categories of products .
