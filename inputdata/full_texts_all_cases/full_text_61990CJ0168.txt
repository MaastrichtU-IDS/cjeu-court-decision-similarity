Summary
1. According to well-established case law, a Member State may not plead provisions, practices or circumstances existing within its internal system in order to justify a failure to comply with obligations and time-limits laid down by Community directives.  2. Mere administrative practices, which by their nature may be altered at the whim of the authorities and lack the appropriate publicity, cannot be regarded as a valid fulfilment of the obligation imposed by Article of the Treaty on Member States to which the directives are addressed (see judgment in Case 145/Commission v Italy [1983] ECR 711).
