Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 543/OF THE COUNCIL OF MARCH ON THE HARMONIZATION OF CERTAIN SOCIAL LEGISLATION RELATING TO ROAD TRANSPORT ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ) AS AMENDED BY COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2827/OF DECEMBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , , P . ), 
Grounds
BY AN ORDER OF MARCH WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON MARCH THE OBERVERWALTUNGSGERICHT BREMEN SUBMITTED TO THE COURT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE INTERPRETATION OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 543/OF THE COUNCIL OF MARCH ON THE HARMONIZATION OF CERTAIN SOCIAL LEGISLATION RELATING TO ROAD TRANSPORT ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ) AS AMENDED BY COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2827/OF DECEMBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , , P . ).   THOSE QUESTIONS WERE RAISED IN THE COURSE OF AN ACTION BETWEEN AN UNDERTAKING ENTRUSTED , PURSUANT TO A CONTRACT GOVERNED BY PRIVATE LAW CONCLUDED WITH THE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES OF THE CITY OF BREMEN AND THE SURROUNDING DISTRICT , WITH THE REMOVAL OF REFUSE WITH ITS OWN VEHICLES IN THOSE TERRITORIES AND THE OFFICERS OF THE INDUSTRIAL INSPECTORATE OF THE CITY OF BREMEN WHO FOUND IN JUNE THAT THE UNDERTAKING WAS FAILING TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF REGULATION NO 543/, IN PARTICULAR THOSE OF ARTICLE CONCERNING DRIVING PERIODS AND OF ARTICLE CONCERNING THE REQUIREMENT THAT CREW MEMBERS OF A VEHICLE MUST BE IN POSSESSION OF AN INDIVIDUAL CONTROL BOOK , AND THEREFORE REQUIRED THE UNDERTAKING , BY A DECISION OF MARCH , TO COMPLY WITH THOSE PROVISIONS , FAILING WHICH PENALTIES WOULD BE IMPOSED . THE UNDERTAKING CONCERNED CONTESTED THAT DECISION CLAIMING THAT SINCE THE SERVICE WHICH IT PROVIDED WAS COVERED BY PUBLIC LAW THE VEHICLES     WHICH IT USED TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE MUST BE CONSIDERED AS VEHICLES USED FOR CARRIAGE WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 543/AND THEREBY OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE REGULATION .   THE OBJECTION WAS DISMISSED AND THE UNDERTAKING INSTITUTED PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE VERWALTUNGSGERICHT BREMEN . IN THE COURSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS COUNCIL REGULATION NO 2827/OF DECEMBER ENTERED INTO FORCE . ARTICLE OF THE NEW REGULATION AMENDED ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 543/. THE VERWALTUNGSGERICHT BREMEN CONSIDERED THAT , SINCE THE CONTESTED DECISION HAD CONTINUING EFFECT , ITS VALIDITY MUST BE APPRAISED WITH REFERENCE TO THE AMENDED WORDING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 543/. IT FURTHER DECIDED THAT THAT PROVISION AS AMENDED DID NOT EXEMPT THE APPLICANT UNDERTAKING FROM THE PROVISIONS OF REGULATION NO 543/. AN APPEAL WAS LODGED WITH THE OBERVERWALTUNGSGERICHT BREMEN WHICH CONSIDERED THAT IN ORDER TO SETTLE THE DISPUTE IT WAS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN AN INTERPRETATION OF THE SECOND PART OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 543/AS AMENDED BY REGULATION NO 2827/AND SUBMITTED THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE :    ' ' ( A ) ( AA ) DO THE WORDS ' VEHICLES WHICH ARE USED BY OTHER PUBLIC AUTHORITIES FOR PUBLIC SERVICES '  FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE PROVISIONS REFERRED TO ABOVE COVER ONLY VEHICLES WHICH ARE OWNED BY OR IN THE CONTROL OF THE PUBLIC AUTHORITY ; OR   ( BB ) DO THEY ALSO COVER THE VEHICLES OF PRIVATE PERSONS OR UNDERTAKINGS WHICH ARE USED BY THEM FOR PUBLIC SERVICES ON BEHALF OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES UNDER AN AGREEMENT GOVERNED BY PRIVATE LAW ( ' WERKVERTRAG '  ( CONTRACT FOR SERVICES))?    ( B)IF THE ANSWER TO QUESTION ( A ) ( BB ) IS IN THE AFFIRMATIVE :   ARE THE VEHICLES OF A PRIVATE UNDERTAKING TO WHICH A PUBLIC AUTHORITY HAS TRANSFERRED EXCLUSIVELY THE OPERATIONS FOR PUBLIC SERVICES WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PROVISIONS LISTED ABOVE TO BE CONSIDERED AS ' IN COMPETITION WITH ' ' PROFESSIONAL ' '  ROAD HAULIERS '  ON THE GROUND THAT THE PUBLIC AUTHORITY CAN TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT CONCLUDED WITH THE APPOINTED PRIVATE UNDERTAKING IF ANOTHER UNDERTAKING OFFERS THE USE OF ITS VEHICLES ON MORE FAVOURABLE TERMS?  ' '       ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 543/OF THE COUNCIL AS AMENDED BY REGULATION NO 2827/OF THE COUNCIL PROVIDES :    ' ' THIS REGULATION SHALL NOT APPLY TO CARRIAGE BY :    . . .   ( ) VEHICLES USED BY THE POLICE , GENDARMERIE , ARMED FORCES , FIRE-BRIGADES , CIVIL DEFENCE , DRAINAGE OR FLOOD-PREVENTION AUTHORITIES , WATER , GAS OR ELECTRICITY SERVICES , HIGHWAY AUTHORITIES AND REFUSE COLLECTION , TELEGRAPH OR TELEPHONE SERVICES , BY POSTAL AUTHORITIES FOR THE CARRIAGE OF MAIL , BY RADIO OR TELEVISION SERVICES OR FOR THE DETECTION OF RADIO OR TELEVISION TRANSMITTERS OR RECEIVERS , OR VEHICLES WHICH ARE USED BY OTHER PUBLIC AUTHORITIES FOR PUBLIC SERVICES AND WHICH ARE NOT IN COMPETITION SERVICES AND WHICH ARE NOT IN COMPETITION WITH PROFESSIONAL ROAD HAULIERS .   . . . ' '  SINCE THE PROVISION IN QUESTION CREATES AN EXCEPTION TO THE GENERAL ARRANGEMENTS ESTABLISHED BY REGULATION NO 543/OF THE COUNCIL RELATING TO ROAD TRANSPORT ITS SCOPE MUST BE DETERMINED WITH REGARD TO THE OBJECTIVES OF THAT REGULATION AND TO THE LEGAL CONTEXT IN WHICH IT IS SITUATED .   AS MAY BE SEEN FROM THE PREAMBLE , REGULATION NO 543/OF THE COUNCIL HAS AS ITS ESSENTIAL OBJECTIVE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF COUNCIL DECISION NO 65/271/EEC OF MAY ON THE HARMONIZATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS AFFECTING COMPETITION IN TRANSPORT BY RAIL , ROAD AND INLAND WATERWAY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION 1965-, P . ) IN PARTICULAR SECTION III THEREOF CONCERNING SOCIAL PROVISIONS , WHICH PROVIDES IN -ARTICLE THAT ' ' . . . LAWS , REGULATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS RELATING SPECIFICALLY TO WORKING CONDITIONS IN TRANSPORT BY RAIL , ROAD AND INLAND WATERWAY SHALL . . . BE APPROXIMATED . . . ' ' . IT WAS IN FACT WITH REGARD TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ARTICLES AND OF THAT SECTION THAT IT WAS STATED IN THE PREAMBLE TO REGULATION NO 543/THAT PRIORITY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO NECESSARY MEASURES DEALING WITH MANNING , DRIVING-TIME AND REST-PERIODS AND THAT PROVISION WAS MADE FOR ESTABLISHING A SYSTEM - CONTROL BOOK OR SUITABLE     MECHANICAL RECORDING EQUIPMENT ( ART . ) - PERMITTING COMPLIANCE IN INDIVIDUAL CASES WITH THE PROVISIONS ON TIME AT WORK TO BE CHECKED . IN PURSUIT OF THESE OBJECTIVES , IN THE CONTEXT OF APPROXIMATION OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION , THE REGULATION IN QUESTION FALLS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A COMMON TRANSPORT POLICY FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY AND AT THE SAME TIME CORRESPONDS TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF A COMMUNITY SOCIAL POLICY WHICH , PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE TREATY , IS INTENDED TO ' ' PROMOTE IMPROVED WORKING CONDITIONS AND AN IMPROVED STANDARD OF LIVING FOR WORKERS , SO AS TO MAKE POSSIBLE THEIR HARMONIZATION WHILE THE IMPROVEMENT IS BEING MAINTAINED ' ' .   FURTHERMORE REGARD SHOULD BE HAD TO THE FACT THAT THE PROVISIONS IN QUESTION , AS IS SHOWN BY THE SAID COUNCIL DECISION OF , HAVE AMONGST THEIR OBJECTIVES THE ELIMINATION OF DISPARITIES LIABLE TO CAUSE DISTORTION IN COMPETITION IN THE TRANSPORT SECTOR BY ABOLISHING TRADE PRACTICES BASED ON THE IMPROPER USE OF MANPOWER .   THE SCOPE OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 543/AS AMENDED BY REGULATION NO 2827/MUST THUS BE ESTABLISHED IN THE LIGHT OF THOSE OBJECTIVES . THE ABOVE-MENTIONED SUBPARAGRAPH ( ), BY EXEMPTING CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF TRANSPORT FROM THE SCOPE OF THE GENERAL ARRANGEMENTS , COVERS ONLY THE SERVICE VEHICLES MENTIONED IN THE FIRST PART THEREOF , AND REFERS WITH REGARD TO ' ' VEHICLES WHICH ARE USED BY OTHER PUBLIC AUTHORITIES FOR PUBLIC SERVICES ' '  EXCLUSIVELY TO SITUATIONS WHERE NO ELEMENT OF COMPETITION CAN EXIST . IN FACT IN SUCH CASES IT IS POSSIBLE TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF SOCIAL PROTECTION AND ROAD-SAFETY BY NATIONAL RULES GOVERNING THE PUBLIC SERVICE IN QUESTION REGARD BEING HAD TO THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH SERVICE .   THE ABOVE-MENTIONED ARTICLE ( ) DOES NOT STATE CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY THAT THE EXCEPTION WHICH IT CREATES FROM THE SCOPE OF THE GENERAL ARRANGEMENTS EXTENDS TO CARRIAGE BY VEHICLES BELONGING TO PRIVATE UNDERTAKINGS WHICH HAVE COMPETED FOR A CONTRACT TO PROVIDE A PUBLIC SERVICE , SUCH AS THE REMOVAL OF REFUSE , ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES . ALTHOUGH THE WORDING OF THAT PROVISION LEAVES NO DOUBT AS TO ITS APPLICATION TO VEHICLES OWNED BY OR UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE PUBLIC AUTHORITY IT IS HOWEVER INSUFFICIENTLY CLEAR AND PRECISE TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS REFERRING ALSO TO VEHICLES BELONGING TO A PRIVATE     UNDERTAKING AND USED BY THE LATTER TO PERFORM A PUBLIC SERVICE OR A SERVICE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST WHICH IT HAS UNDERTAKEN TO PROVIDE UNDER A CONTRACT GOVERNED BY PRIVATE LAW .   FOR THESE REASONS THE REPLY TO BE GIVEN TO THE FIRST QUESTION AT ( AA ) SHOULD BE THAT THE WORDS ' ' VEHICLES WHICH ARE USED BY OTHER PUBLIC AUTHORITIES FOR PUBLIC SERVICES ' '  FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 543/OF THE COUNCIL OF MARCH AS AMENDED BY REGULATION NO 2827/OF THE COUNCIL OF DECEMBER MUST BE UNDERSTOOD AS COVERING ONLY VEHICLES WHICH ARE OWNED BY OR UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE PUBLIC AUTHORITY .   IN VIEW OF THE REPLY GIVEN TO THAT QUESTION CONSIDERATION OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY THE NATIONAL COURT IS NO LONGER REQUIRED .
