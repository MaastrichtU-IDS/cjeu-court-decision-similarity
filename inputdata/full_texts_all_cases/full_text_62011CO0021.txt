Reference for a preliminary ruling — Commissione tributaria provinciale di Benevento — Interpretation of Articles 10(c) and
                  12(e) of Council Directive No 69/335/EEC of July concerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital (OJ, English

The reference for a preliminary ruling made by the Commissione tributaria provinciale di Benevento (Italy), by decision of
         September 2010, is manifestly inadmissible.
