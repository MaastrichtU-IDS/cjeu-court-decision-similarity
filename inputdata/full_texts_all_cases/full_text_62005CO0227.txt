Operative part
1.
The combined provisions of Article 1(2) and Article 8(2) and (4) of Council Directive 91/439/EEC of July on driving
                     licences, as amended by Council Directive 97/26/EC of June 1997, preclude a Member State from refusing to recognise, within
                     its territory, the right to drive conferred by a driving licence issued in another Member State and, accordingly, the validity
                     of that licence, on the ground that the holder of that licence, whose licence had previously been confiscated within the territory
                     of the first Member State, did not take the test for aptitude to drive required by the law of that State in order for a new
                     licence to be supplied following the confiscation of the previous licence, where the temporary ban on obtaining a new licence
                     imposed at the same time as that confiscation had expired when the driving licence was supplied in the other Member State.
                     
                  
2.
The combined provisions of Article 1(2) and Article 8(2) and (4) of Directive 91/439, as amended by Directive 97/26, preclude
                     a Member State, which has received a request, in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings, to exchange a valid
                     driving licence supplied in another Member State for a national driving licence, from making such an exchange subject to the
                     condition that the applicant take a new test of his aptitude to drive, required by the law of the first Member State in order
                     to remove any doubts in that regard by reason of circumstances predating the acquisition of the licence in the other Member
                     State.
