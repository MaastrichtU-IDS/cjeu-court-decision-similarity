Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF  ( I ) THE IMPLIED DECISION CONTAINED IN A LETTER OF MAY WHEREBY THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY REFUSED TO OFFER A POST TO THE APPLICANT ;   ( II ) THE EXPRESS DECISION CONTAINED IN THE LETTER OF MAY REJECTING THE APPLICANT ' S REQUEST THAT THE PERIOD OF VALIDITY OF THE LIST OF SUITABLE CANDIDATES IN COUNCIL COMPETITION NO A/SHOULD BE EXTENDED ;   ( III ) ALL THE DECISIONS APPOINTING ADMINISTRATORS FOLLOWING COUNCIL COMPETITION NO A/,   
Grounds
BY APPLICATION RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON MAY EMMANUEL DU BESSET BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF SEVERAL COUNCIL DECISIONS .  SINCE THE APPLICANT WAS SUCCESSFUL IN COUNCIL COMPETITION NO A/, HIS NAME WAS PLACED ON THE LIST OF SUITABLE CANDIDATES DRAWN UP IN AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE COMPETITION . THE PERIOD OF VALIDITY OF THAT LIST WAS EXTENDED UNTIL APRIL . ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS , AND MOST RECENTLY ON MARCH , THE APPLICANT POINTED OUT TO THE COUNCIL THAT HE WAS STILL WAITING FOR A POST .  BY LETTER DATED MAY THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY INFORMED THE APPLICANT THAT IT HAD DECIDED NOT TO EXTEND THE PERIOD OF VALIDITY OF THE LIST OF SUITABLE CANDIDATES ANY MORE . THE ACTION IS PRIMARILY DIRECTED AGAINST THE REFUSAL TO OFFER HIM A POST , AND ALTERNATIVELY THE REFUSAL TO EXTEND THE PERIOD OF VALIDITY OF THE LIST OF SUITABLE CANDIDATES , CONTAINED IN THE LETTER OF MAY .   ON JULY THE APPLICANT SUBMITTED TO THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY A COMPLAINT PRIOR TO INITIATING AN ACTION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES .  BY APPLICATION ON A PROCEDURAL ISSUE PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE COUNCIL RAISED A PRELIMINARY OBJECTION AS TO ADMISSIBILITY AND REQUESTED THE COURT TO GIVE A DECISION THEREON WITHOUT GOING INTO THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CASE . IN THAT RESPECT IT SUBMITS THAT THE ACTION WAS NOT PRECEDED BY A COMPLAINT WHICH WAS REJECTED BY AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED DECISION .  THE APPLICANT SUBMITS THAT ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OUGHT NOT TO APPLY IN THE PRESENT CASE BECAUSE HE IS NEITHER AN OFFICIAL NOR AT PRESENT A CANDIDATE IN A COMPETITION .  THE APPLICANT ' S ARGUMENT CANNOT BE ACCEPTED . IT IS CLEAR FROM THE ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW OF THE COURT THAT ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS APPLY NOT ONLY TO THOSE WHO ARE OFFICIALS BUT ALSO TO CANDIDATES FOR A POST ( SEE THE JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER IN JOINED CASES TO 88/, MARENCO AND OTHERS V COMMISSION , ( ) ECR ). THE APPLICANT HAS NOT CEASED TO BE A CANDIDATE BECAUSE THE PERIOD OF VALIDITY OF THE LIST OF SUITABLE CANDIDATES WAS NOT EXTENDED . SINCE THE MEASURE ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE APPLICANT ORIGINATES FROM THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY THE ACTION CHALLENGING THE MEASURE MUST NECESSARILY BE PRECEDED BY A COMPLAINT WHICH HAS BEEN REJECTED BY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED DECISION . THE OBJECT OF THAT PROCEDURE IS TO ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATION TO RECONSIDER THE CONTESTED MEASURE . BY VIRTUE OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AN ACTION BROUGHT BEFORE THAT PRELIMINARY PROCEDURE HAS BEEN COMPLETED IS PREMATURE AND THEREFORE INADMISSIBLE .  SINCE THE DOCUMENTS BEFORE THE COURT CONTAIN ALL THE FACTS NECESSARY FOR A DECISION IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO HEAR THE PARTIES .  
Decision on costs
COSTS UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE , THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS . HOWEVER , ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE PROVIDES THAT THE INSTITUTIONS ARE TO BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS IN PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES . THAT PROVISION MUST APPLY TO ALL PERSONS TO WHOM ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS APPLIES .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ( SECOND CHAMBER ),   PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE AND  AFTER HEARING THE ADVOCATE GENERAL ,   MAKES THE FOLLOWING  ORDER   ( ) THE ACTION IS DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE .   ( ) THE PARTIES SHALL BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .
