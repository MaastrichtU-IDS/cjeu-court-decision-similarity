Parties
IN CASE 125/REFERECE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE HAMBURG FINANZGERICHT ( IVTH SENATE ) FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  NEUFELD AND CO ., BERLIN,  AND  HAUPTZOLLAMT HAMBURG-WALTERSHOF,  
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO OF THE COUNCIL DATED APRIL ( OJ 1962, NO ) IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO OF THE COUNCIL DATED JUNE ( OJ 1962, NO ), REGARDING THE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT OF TURNOVER EQUALIZATION TAX AND COSTS INHERENT IN DENATURING FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE LEVY ON PROCESSED CEREAL PRODUCTS, 
Grounds
BY ORDER DATED MARCH FILED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON APRIL THE HAMBURG FINANZGERICHT REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY A QUESTION CONCERNING THE INTERPRETATION OF VARIOUS PROVISIONS OF REGULATION NO OF THE COUNCIL OF APRIL ON THE GRADUAL ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN CEREALS ( OJ 1962, NO ), AND OF REGULATION NO OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE SYSTEM OF PROCESSED GOODS BASED ON CEREALS ( OJ 1962, NO ).  THE QUESTION IS WHETHER, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE JUDGMENT GIVEN BY THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ON MAY IN CASE 76/70, ARTICLES OF REGULATION 19/AND OF REGULATION NO 55/MUST BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE TURNOVER EQUALIZATION TAX IMPOSED ON THE IMPORT OF PROCESSED PRODUCTS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE ( D ) AND IN THE ANNEX TO REGULATION NO 19/MUST BE DEDUCTED FROM THE AMOUNT OF THE LEVY APPLICABLE TO THESE PRODUCTS .  THE QUESTION RAISED DEALS WITH THE CALCULATION OF THE LEVY APPLICABLE TO " TAPIOCA FLOUR " COVERED BY THE EXPRESSION " PROCESSED PRODUCTS " IN ARTICLE ( D ) AND IN THE ANNEX TO REGULATION NO 19/.  THIS LEVY, CALCULATED UNDER ARTICLE OF THE SAID REGULATION, IS COMPOSED OF TWO COMPONENTS, THE ONE VARIABLE AND THE OTHER FIXED .  AS REGARDS PROCESSED PRODUCTS NOT CONTAINING THE BASIC PRODUCTS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE ( A ), THE VARIABLE COMPONENT OF THE LEVY WAS FIXED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) ( B ), AFTER TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE CONDITIONS OF THE MARKETS IN PRODUCTS PROCESSED FROM THE ABOVEMENTIONED BASIC PRODUCTS WHICH MUST RESEMBLE THEM .  FOR THIS PURPOSE ARTICLE ( ) PROVIDES, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ( ), THAT FOR THE PROCESSED PRODUCTS REFERRED TO IN THE ANNEX TO REGULATION NO 19/UNDER HEADING 11.OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF, INCLUDING " TAPIOCA FLOUR ", THE VARIABLE COMPONENT APPLICABLE TO KILOGRAMMES OF PROCESSED PRODUCT IS EQUAL TO THE VARIABLE COMPONENT REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE APPLICABLE TO KILOGRAMMES OF MAIZE STARCH .  ACCORDING TO THE SAID ARTICLE THE VARIABLE COMPONENT APPLICABLE TO KILOGRAMMES OF MAIZE STARCH IS EQUAL TO THE LEVY APPLICABLE TO KILOGRAMMES OF MAIZE .  MOREOVER, ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) DETERMINED THE FIXED COMPONENT OF THE LEVY APPLICABLE TO THE PRODUCT IN QUESTION AT 1.UNITS OF ACCOUNT .  IT APPEARS FROM THESE PROVISIONS THAT, CONTRARY TO THE SYSTEM INSTITUTED BY ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 19/62, WHERE THE LEVY MAY VARY ACCORDING TO THE DIFFERENCES EXISTING BETWEEN THE C.I.F . AND THE THRESHOLD PRICES, THE SYSTEM ESTABLISHED BY ARTICLE OF THIS SAME REGULATION AND ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 55/PROVIDES FOR THE APPLICATION OF A LEVY, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH IS CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO PRE-ESTABLISHED CRITERIA, I.E . THE LEVY WHICH EFFECTIVELY APPLIES TO MAIZE STARCH ON THE ONE HAND AND THE FIXED RATE INDICATED BY THE LEGISLATURE ON THE OTHER .  IN THIS SYSTEM, WHEREBY THERE IS A LEVY ALL THE ELEMENTS OF WHICH ARE FIXED BY COMMUNITY RULES, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR MEMBER STATES TO VARY THE AMOUNT OF THE LEVY BY THE EXPEDIENT OF CRITERIA OF CALCULATION NOT PROVIDED FOR BY THE LEGISLATURE AND TO DEDUCT THE TURNOVER EQUALIZATION TAX, WHERE APPROPRIATE, FROM THE SAID AMOUNT .  SUCH A DEDUCTION WOULD AFFECT THE RATE OF THE FIXED AND VARIABLE COMPONENTS OF THE LEVY, WHICH REGULATION NO 55/HAS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY CALCULATED .  THEREFORE ARTICLES OF REGULATION NO 19/AND OF REGULATION NO 55/MUST BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE TURNOVER EQUALIZATION TAX IMPOSED ON IMPORT MAY NOT BE DEDUCTED FROM THE LEVY .  
Decision on costs
THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY AND THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, WHICH HAVE SUBMITTED OBSERVATIONS TO THE COURT, ARE NOT RECOVERABLE, AND AS THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE, INSOFAR AS THE PARTIES TO THE MAIN ACTION ARE CONCERNED, A STEP IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE A NATIONAL COURT, THE DECISION ON COSTS IS A MATTER FOR THAT COURT . 
Operative part
THE COURT  IN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION REFERRED TO IT BY THE HAMBURG FINANZGERICHT BY ORDER OF THAT COURT DATED MARCH 1973, HEREBY RULES :  ARTICLES OF REGULATION NO OF THE COUNCIL OF THE EEC OF APRIL AND OF REGULATION NO OF THE COUNCIL OF THE EEC OF JUNE MUST BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE TURNOVER EQUALIZATION TAX IMPOSED ON THE IMPORT OF THE PROCESSED PRODUCTS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE ( D ) AND IN THE ANNEX TO REGULATION NO 19/MAY NOT BE DEDUCTED FROM THE LEVY .
