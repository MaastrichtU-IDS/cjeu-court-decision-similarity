Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON NOVEMBER , THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION BEFORE THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT , BY NEITHER ADOPTING NOR NOTIFYING THE MEASURES PROVIDED FOR BY COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2967/OF NOVEMBER LAYING DOWN COMMON STANDARDS FOR THE WATER CONTENT OF FROZEN AND DEEP-FROZEN CHICKENS , HENS AND COCKS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) AND COMMISSION REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2785/OF OCTOBER INTRODUCING DETAILED RULES FOR IMPLEMENTING THE ABOVE-MENTIONED COUNCIL REGULATION ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAD FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY .   SINCE , DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROCEDURE , THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT , BY A DECREE OF MARCH ISSUED BY THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND FORESTS ( GAZZETTA UFFICIALE OF MARCH ), ADOPTED THE PRACTICAL CONTROL MEASURES REQUIRED BY COUNCIL REGULATION NO 2967/, THE COMMISSION , BY REGISTERED LETTER OF JUNE , WITHDREW ITS ACTION IN SO FAR AS IT SOUGHT A DECLARATION THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAD FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER REGULATION NO 2967/, CONTINUING ITS ACTION WITH RESPECT ONLY TO COMMISSION REGULATION NO 2785/.        AS ITS TITLE INDICATES , COMMISSION REGULATION NO 2785/LAYS DOWN THE DETAILED RULES FOR IMPLEMENTING COUNCIL REGULATION NO 2967/. ARTICLE OBLIGES MEMBER STATES TO TAKE ALL APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO IMPOSE PENALTIES FOR ANY INFRINGEMENT OF THE COUNCIL REGULATION , AND ARTICLE REQUIRES THEM TO INFORM THE OTHER MEMBER STATES AND THE COMMISSION , BEFORE MARCH , OF THE PRACTICAL CONTROL METHODS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE COUNCIL REGULATION AND THE PROVISIONS ADOPTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE OF THE COMMISSION REGULATION .   THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DENY THAT IT HAS NOT FULFILLED THOSE OBLIGATIONS . IN ITS DEFENCE , IT CLAIMS THAT A DRAFT BILL HAS BEEN PREPARED FOR THE PURPOSE , IN PARTICULAR , OF DETERMINING THE BODIES WITH POWERS TO CONDUCT THE CHECKS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE OF THE COUNCIL REGULATION AND OF LAYING DOWN THE PENALTIES FOR INFRINGEMENT OF THAT REGULATION AND THE PROCEDURES FOR THE IMPOSITION THEREOF . SINCE THE MEASURES TO BE ADOPTED INVOLVE PENALTIES , THEY CANNOT , UNDER ITALIAN LAW , BE ADOPTED BY MINISTERIAL DECREE BUT ONLY IN THE FORM OF A LAW , FOR WHICH THE PREPARATORY PROCEDURE IS MORE COMPLEX .   THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES DO NOT HOWEVER EXPUNGE THE FAILURE WITH WHICH THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC IS CHARGED . ACCORDING TO WELL-ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW , A MEMBER STATE MAY NOT PLEAD PROVISIONS , PRACTICES OR CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING IN ITS INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OBLIGATIONS AND TIME-LIMITS RESULTING FROM COMMUNITY LAW .   IT MUST THEREFORE BE HELD THAT , BY NEITHER ADOPTING NOR NOTIFYING WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE MEASURES PROVIDED FOR IN COMMISSION REGULATION NO 2785/OF OCTOBER , THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS . SINCE THE DEFENDANT HAS FAILED IN ITS SUBMISSIONS , IT MUST BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .
