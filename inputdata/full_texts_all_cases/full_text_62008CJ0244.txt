Operative part
The Court: 
1.
	Declares that the Italian Republic has failed, in relation to the refund of value added tax to a taxable person residing in
                     another Member State or in a non-Member State, but having a fixed establishment in the Member State concerned, to fulfil its
                     obligations under Article of the Eighth Council Directive 79/1072/EEC of December on the harmonisation of the laws
                     of the Member States relating to turnover taxes – Arrangements for the refund of value added tax to taxable persons not established
                     in the territory of the country, and Article of the Thirteenth Council Directive 86/560/EEC of November on the harmonisation
                     of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes – Arrangements for the refund of value added tax to taxable persons
                     not established in Community territory, by requiring a taxable person established in another Member State or in a non-member
                     State, but having a fixed establishment in Italy and who, during the period at issue, supplied goods and services in Italy,
                     to apply for a refund of input value added tax according to the mechanism provided by those directives rather than deduct
                     it when the purchase in respect of which repayment of that tax is sought is made not through that fixed establishment, but
                     directly by the principal establishment of that taxable person;
                  
2.
	Orders the Italian Republic to pay the costs.
