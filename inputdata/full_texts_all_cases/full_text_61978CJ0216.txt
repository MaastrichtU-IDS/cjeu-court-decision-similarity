IN CASE 216/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE FINANZGERICHT ( FINANCE COURT ) DUSSELDORF FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  NICOLAI BELJATZKY , BERLIN ,   AND  HAUPTZOLLAMT ( PRINCIPAL CUSTOMS OFFICE ) AACHEN-SUD ,

ON THE INTERPRETATION OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1259/OF THE COMMISSION OF JUNE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P . ) CONCERNING THE APPLICATION OF THE FAVOURABLE TARIFF PROVISIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THAT REGULATION TO CONCENTRATED BUTTER FROM STORAGE , 
Grounds
1BY AN ORDER OF JUNE , WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT OF JUSTICE ON SEPTEMBER , THE FINANZGERICHT DUSSELDORF SUBMITTED TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY TWO PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS ON THE INTERPRETATION OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1259/OF THE COMMISSION OF JUNE ON THE DISPOSAL OF BUTTER AT A REDUCED PRICE TO CERTAIN COMMUNITY PROCESSING UNDERTAKINGS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION , ( II ), P . ).    2THESE QUESTIONS WERE RAISED IN THE COURSE OF AN ACTION BETWEEN THE CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY AND AN IMPORTER OF BUTTER FROM BELGIUM CONCERNING THE APPLICATION TO THAT BUTTER OF THE TARIFF PROVISIONS LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1259/.    3THE GERMAN CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES FIRST CHARGED ON THE IMPORTATIONS OF THAT PRODUCT , WHICH WAS PRODUCED FROM BUTTER FROM STORAGE AND INTENDED FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF FINE BAKERS '  WARES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF REGULATION NO 1259/, THE REDUCED MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS PROVIDED FOR IN THE ABOVE-MENTIONED ARTICLE AND SUBSEQUENTLY , BY A NOTICE OF CORRECTIVE ASSESSMENT , CHARGED IN RESPECT OF THE IMPORTATIONS A SUM EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE REDUCED AMOUNTS AND THE AMOUNTS NORMALLY APPLICABLE OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM ESTABLISHED BY REGULATION NO 1259/.    4IN STATING THE REASONS FOR THE CORRECTIVE ASSESSMENT THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES CLAIMED THAT , SINCE THE BUTTER IN QUESTION HAD NOT BEEN PUT BY THE FINAL USER TO THE USE PRESCRIBED IN THE ABOVE-MENTIONED REGULATION , IT COULD NOT QUALIFY FOR THE REDUCED COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS THEREBY FIXED AND THAT IT BECAME LIABLE TO THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS PRESCRIBED FOR BUTTER FREELY MARKETABLE WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS AS TO ITS USE .   5THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION OBJECTS INTER ALIA THAT THERE IS NO LEGAL BASIS FOR SUCH A CORRECTIVE ASSESSMENT SINCE COMMUNITY LAW , IN PARTICULAR REGULATION NO 1259/, DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY INDEPENDENT PROVISIONS WHICH AUTHORIZE THE SUBSEQUENT RECOVERY OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NORMAL RATE AND THE REDUCED RATE OF THE COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS INITIALLY APPLIED TO THE PRODUCT WHERE IT IS DIVERTED FROM ITS DESTINATION LAID DOWN BY LAW .   6IN ORDER TO HAVE THIS POINT CLARIFIED THE FINANZGERICHT DUSSELDORF HAS REFERRED THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE :    ' ' . IS ARTICLE OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1259/OF JUNE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P . ) TO BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT THE DEFINITIVE PREFERENTIAL LEVY TREATMENT ( REDUCTION OF THE COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS ) IS SUBJECT ONLY TO THE CONDITION THAT THE PRODUCT BE MARKETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLES TO OF THE REGULATION OR IS THERE THE FURTHER CONDITION THAT THE PRODUCT BE USED IN THE MANNER PRESCRIBED BY THE REGULATION?    . IN THE LATTER CASE :   IS ARTICLE ITSELF AN INDEPENDENT PROVISION ALLOWING FOR THE LEVY OF A SUPPLEMENTARY CHARGE?  ' '    7SINCE THE QUESTIONS ARE RELATED THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED TOGETHER .   8THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1259/OF THE COMMISSION PROVIDES THAT :    ' ' THE COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO BUTTER , CONCENTRATED BUTTER AND CONCENTRATED BUTTER WITH ADDED SUGAR . . ., FOR THE PART CONSISTING OF BUTTER , SHALL BE EQUAL TO THE COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS FIXED PURSUANT TO REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 974/, MULTIPLIED BY A COEFFICIENT OF 0.' ' .  THIS PROVISION MUST BE INTERPRETED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK NOT ONLY OF REGULATION NO 1259/BUT ALSO OF THE GENERAL RULES GOVERNING THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS .   9REGULATION NO 1259/LAYS DOWN MEASURES OF CONJUNCTURAL ECONOMIC POLICY INTENDED TO PROMOTE THE DISPOSAL OF BUTTER FROM STORAGE , THE PROLONGED STORAGE OF WHICH ENTAILS HIGH COSTS FOR THE AGRICULTURAL INTERVENTION AGENCIES . IT PROMOTES SUCH DISPOSAL BY MAKING PROVISION , THROUGH ARRANGEMENTS FOR STANDING INVITATION TO TENDER , FOR THE SALE OF BUTTER FROM STORAGE AT A REDUCED PRICE BY THE AGRICULTURAL INTERVENTION AGENCIES TO BUTTER-PROCESSING UNDERTAKINGS IN THE COMMUNITY , WHEREBY THE SUCCESSFUL TENDERER UNDERTAKES TO PROCESS THE BUTTER PURCHASED INTO CONCENTRATED BUTTER HAVING THE COMPOSITION SPECIFIED IN ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) AND NOT TO USE IT OR TO ENSURE THAT IT IS NOT USED OTHERWISE THAN FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF THE PRODUCTS IN HEADING 19.OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF . IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE BUTTER THUS DISPOSED OF IS USED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT PURPOSE AND THAT IT IS NOT FREELY MARKETED THE REGULATION ESTABLISHES A SYSTEM OF SUPERVISION ENTAILING THE PROVISION OF A PROCESSING SECURITY , TO BE RELEASED ON THE CONDITIONS SET OUT IN ARTICLES AND OF THE REGULATION .   10MULTIPLICATION , IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE OF THE SAID REGULATION , BY A CORRECTING COEFFICIENT WHICH APPLIES TO BUTTER FROM STORAGE SOLD ON THE ABOVE-MENTIONED CONDITIONS COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN THOSE NORMALLY APPLIED TO BUTTER UNDER REGULATION NO 974/, DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ONE OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED MEASURES INTENDED TO PROMOTE THE DISPOSAL AND MARKETING OF BUTTER FROM STORAGE BUT FORMS PART OF THE GENERAL RULES SET OUT IN REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 974/OF THE COUNCIL OF MAY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ).   11IT IS IN FACT CLEAR FROM THOSE RULES , IN PARTICULAR FROM ARTICLE OF THAT REGULATION , THAT THE FIXING OF MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS IS BASED INTER ALIA ON THE PRICES OF THE PRODUCTS IN QUESTION . THE PENULTIMATE RECITAL IN THE PREAMBLE TO REGULATION NO 1259/, WHICH STATES THAT ' ' AS REGARDS THE COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS FIXED PURSUANT TO COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 974/OF MAY . . . ACCOUNT SHOULD BE TAKEN OF THE VALUE OF THE PRODUCTS CONCERNED ' ' , CLEARLY REFERS TO THE PRINCIPLE UNDERLYING THAT PROVISION WHEREBY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS MUST BE ADJUSTED ON THE BASIS OF THE PRICES OF THE PRODUCTS IN QUESTION , REPRESENTING THEIR MARKET VALUE .   12IT IS IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT REGULATION THAT ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1259/MAKES PROVISION , WITH REGARD TO THE BUTTER AND CONCENTRATED BUTTER REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THAT REGULATION , FOR THE APPLICATION OF A REDUCED MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNT BECAUSE , HAVING REGARD TO THE RESTRICTIONS ON MARKETING TO WHICH THAT PRODUCT IS SUBJECT , ITS MARKET VALUE , AND CONSEQUENTLY ITS PRICE , AND PROPORTIONATELY REDUCED .   13IT IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SAME PRINCIPLE FOR THE COMPETENT CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES TO RE-ASSESS THE REDUCED COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS IF THE PRODUCTS IN QUESTION HAVE BEEN DIVERTED FROM THEIR DESTINATION OR IF THEY HAVE NOT BEEN USED IN ACCORDANCE THEREWITH WITHIN THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED BY ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1259/. IN FACT , IN SO FAR AS THE IMPORTER HAS FAILED TO FURNISH PROOF WITHIN THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PERIOD THAT THE GOODS HAVE REACHED THE DESTINATION WHICH WAS MADE A CONDITION OF THE REDUCTION OF THE COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS , THE GOODS CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS HAVING THE CONVENTIONAL VALUE ATTRIBUTED TO THEM ON THE BASIS OF THE MINIMUM SELLING PRICE REFERRED TO IN REGULATION NO 1259/AND THEY MUST BE CONSIDERED AS BUTTER SOLD AT THE NORMAL MARKET PRICE . IN THAT CASE THE COMPETENT CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES ARE REQUIRED UNDER REGULATION NO 974/OF THE COUNCIL TO APPLY THE COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS LAID DOWN FOR BUTTER MARKETED AT SUCH A PRICE AND THUS TO RE-ASSESS THE REDUCED COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS WHICH WERE INITIALLY APPLIED . SINCE THAT RE-ASSESSMENT HAS REGARD TO THE MARKET PRICE OF THE PRODUCTS IN QUESTION ITS LEGAL BASIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE GENERAL RULES THEMSELVES WHICH GOVERN THE APPLICATION OF MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS .   14FOR THESE REASONS THE REPLY TO THE QUESTIONS SUBMITTED MUST BE THAT THE DEFINITIVE APPLICATION OF THE REDUCED MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS PROVIDED FOR BY ARTICLE OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1259/OF THE COMMISSION OF JUNE PRESUPPOSES THAT THE GOODS IN QUESTION , HAVING REGARD IN PARTICULAR TO THE USE TO WHICH THEY ARE TO BE PUT , HAVE THE REDUCED VALUE ATTRIBUTED TO THEM BY VIRTUE OF REGULATION NO 1259/. IN SO FAR AS THE IMPORTER HAS NOT FURNISHED THE PROOF , WITHIN THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED IN ARTICLE ( ) ( C ) AND ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1259/, THAT THE GOODS HAVE BEEN PUT TO THE USE TO WHICH THE REDUCTION OF THE COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS IS SUBJECT , THE LEGAL BASIS FOR THE SUBSEQUENT RE-ASSESSMENT OF SUCH AMOUNTS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE GENERAL RULES GOVERNING THE SYSTEM OF MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS , AS ESTABLISHED BY REGULATION NO 974/OF THE COUNCIL OF MAY .
