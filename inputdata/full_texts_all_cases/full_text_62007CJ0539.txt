Operative part
The Court: 
1.
	Declares that, by failing, for all calls to the single European emergency call number ‘112’, to make caller location information
                     available, to the extent technically feasible, to the authorities handling emergencies, the Italian Republic has failed to
                     fulfil its obligations under Article 26(3) of Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of March
                     on universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service
                     Directive);
                  
2.
	Orders the Italian Republic to pay the costs.
