ADMISSIBILITY   6THE DEFENDANT OBJECTS THAT THE APPLICATION IS INADMISSIBLE ON THE GROUND THAT THE VACANCY NOTICE AT ISSUE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING AN OFFICIAL WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   7IN FIXING THE CONDITIONS GOVERNING ACCESS TO THE POST THE VACANCY NOTICE , DRAWN UP WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , DETERMINES THE OFFICIALS WHOSE CANDIDATURE MAY BE ACCEPTED .   8IN SO FAR AS THE EFFECT OF THOSE CONDITIONS IS TO RULE OUT THE CANDIDATURE OF OFFICIALS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR TRANSFER OR PROMOTION , THE VACANCY NOTICE CONSTITUTES AN ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING SUCH OFFICIALS .   9THE OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY MUST THEREFORE BE DISMISSED AS REGARDS THAT POINT .   10THE COMMISSION ALSO SUBMITS THAT IN REALITY THE APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT IS DIRECTED NOT AGAINST THE VACANCY NOTICE ITSELF BUT AGAINST THE DECISION TO ASSIGN THE NEWLY-CREATED POST TO WASHINGTON .   11IT MAINTAINS THAT DECISIONS RELATING TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE AVAILABLE POSTS IN THE VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS FALL WITHIN THE FIELD OF ITS DISCRETIONARY POWERS IN THE MATTER .   12THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THAT HEAD OF THE CONCLUSIONS IS LINKED TO THE SUBSTANCE AND , MORE PARTICULARLY , TO THE COMPLAINT RELATING TO MISUSE OF POWERS .  SUBSTANCE   13THE APPLICANT MAINTAINS THAT THE CONTESTED MEASURES INFRINGE ARTICLES ( ) AND ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND ARE VITIATED BY MISUSE OF POWERS .   14SHE ALLEGES THAT THE COMPARATIVE MERITS OF THE CANDIDATE APPOINTED WERE NOT CONSIDERED AS AGAINST HER OWN , SINCE HER PERIODIC REPORT FOR THE PERIOD FROM JULY TO JUNE WAS ONLY DRAWN UP AFTER THE OTHER CANDIDATE HAD BEEN APPOINTED .   15THE APPLICANT ADDS THAT THE FACT THAT FOR MANY YEARS SHE HAD PERFOMED DE FACTO DUTIES ( OF HEAD CLERK ) CORRESPONDING TO A GRADE HIGHER THAN HER OWN WAS NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT .   16SHE FURTHER STATES THAT THE VACANCY NOTICE AT ISSUE WAS DRAWN UP NOT IN THE INTERESTS OF THE SERVICE BUT IN ORDER TO PERMIT THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OTHER CANDIDATE , WHICH WAS ALREADY AGREED BEFOREHAND .   17ALTHOUGH , UNDER ARTICLE ( ), AN OFFICIAL CANNNOT BE COMPELLED TO PERFORM DUTIES CORRESPONDING TO A GRADE HIGHER THAN HIS OWN , EXCEPT ON A TEMPORARY POSTING , THE FACT THAT HE AGREES TO PERFORM THEM MAY BE A FACTOR TO BE BORNE IN MIND IN CONNEXION WITH PROMOTION , BUT DOES NOT GIVE HIM THE RIGHT TO BE RECLASSIFIED .   18ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE AGENCY REQUESTED THE CREATION OF TWO POSTS IN GRADE B , ONE TO BE ASSIGNED TO WASHINGTON AND THE OTHER TO BRUSSELS , JUSTIFIED BUDGETARY CONSIDERATIONS LED HIM SUBSEQUENTLY TO SUBMIT ONLY A SINGLE APPLICATION CONCERNING THE POST FOR WASHINGTON .   19BY DECIDING TO GIVE PRIORITY IN THAT WAY TO THE POST TO BE CREATED IN WASHINGTON , THE AGENCY THEREBY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE DUTIES APPERTAINING TO THAT POST INVOLVED ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES , IN PARTICULAR HAVING REGARD TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RELATIONS TO BE MAINTAINED WITH THE UNITED STATES CIRCLES CONCERNED .   20THE APPLICANT ' S AGE AND SENIORITY IN THE GRADE AND POST , EVEN THOUGH SUPERIOR TO THE SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATE ' S , MUST NOT PREVAIL OVER THE NATURE OF THE DUTIES TO BE CARRIED OUT .   21AS REGARDS THE ABSENCE OF HER LAST PERIODIC REPORT , THE APPLICANT MAINTAINS THAT THIS WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE CONSIDERATION OF THE COMPARATIVE MERITS OF THE CANDIDATES - IF IT HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT - FROM TAKING , PLACE UNDER THE REQUIRED CONDITIONS .   22HOWEVER , THE APPLICANT HAS NOT SHOWN IN WHAT WAY THE ABSENCE OF THE SAID REPORT COULD HAVE BEEN PREJUDICIAL TO HER , SINCE IT COULD NOT HAVE ADDED ANYTHING TO THE EXCELLENT ASSESSMENTS MADE IN THE EARLIER REPORTS .   23THE APPLICATION IS UNFOUNDED AND MUST THEREFORE BE DISMISSED .
