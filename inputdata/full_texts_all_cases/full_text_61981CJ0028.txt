Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 74/561/EEC OF NOVEMBER ON ADMISSION TO THE OCCUPATION OF ROAD HAULAGE OPERATOR IN NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORT OPERATIONS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ), 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON FEBRUARY THE COMMISSION BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAD FAILED TO FULFIL ONE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NEEDED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 74/OF NOVEMBER ON ADMISSION TO THE OCCUPATION OF ROAD HAULAGE OPERATOR IN NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORT OPERATIONS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ).       BY VIRTUE OF ARTICLE OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 74/MEMBER STATES WERE REQUIRED TO ADOPT THE MEASURES NECESSARY FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DIRECTIVE WITHIN A PERIOD EXPIRING ON JANUARY .    THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DISPUTE THE FACT THAT IT HAS NOT SATISFIED THAT OBLIGATION . IT EXPLAINS THAT THE DIRECTIVE IN QUESTION HAS BEEN INCLUDED FOR IMPLEMENTATION IN A DRAFT LAW WHICH IS NOW UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES . THE DRAFT WAS NOT TABLED UNTIL DECEMBER OWING TO THE DETAILED SCRUTINY TO WHICH IT WAS FIRST SUBJECTED BY ALL THE ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITIES CONCERNED . THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT STATES THAT IT HAS ASKED THE AUTHORITIES CONCERNED TO EXPEDITE THE PROCEDURE FOR APPROVING THE DRAFT LAW AND HOPES TO OBTAIN APPROVAL WITHIN THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE TIME . THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT CLAIMS THAT IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES IT MAY BE CONSIDERED THAT THE OBJECT OF THE ACTION HAS BEEN ELIMINATED IN SUBSTANCE SO THAT THIS APPLICATION HAS BECOME DEVOID OF PURPOSE .   THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES DO NOT EXPUNGE THE FAILURE OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS . ACCORDING TO THE WELL-ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW A MEMBER STATE MAY NOT PLEAD PROVISIONS , PRACTICES OR CIRCUMSTANCES IN ITS INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OBLIGATIONS UNDER COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES .   IN THE COURSE OF THE HEARING THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT REQUESTED THE COURT TO GRANT IT AN EXTENSION OF THE PERIOD ALLOWED BY THE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE TREATY FOR FULFILLING THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE DIRECTIVE IN QUESTION .   THE POWERS CONFERRED ON THE COURT IN RELATION TO APPLICATIONS UNDER ARTICLE OF THE TREATY DO NOT INCLUDE THE POWER TO SUBSTITUTE A DIFFERENT PERIOD FOR THAT LAID DOWN BY THE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE IN ITS REASONED OPINION , ALTHOUGH THE LEGALITY OF THAT OPINION IS SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE COURT . SUBJECT TO THE SAME RESERVATION , IT IS FOR THE COMMISSION TO DECIDE WHETHER SUCH A REQUEST FROM A MEMBER STATE IS TO BE GRANTED .   IT MUST THEREFORE BE HELD THAT BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NEEDED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 74/OF NOVEMBER THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ONE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY .  
Decision on costs
