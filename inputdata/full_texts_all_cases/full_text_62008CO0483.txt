Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Tribunal de Première Instance de Mons (Belgium) – Interpretation of Article of the
                  Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of May on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover
                  taxes – Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment (OJ L 145, p. 1) – Concepts of ‘chargeable event’
                  and ‘chargeability of tax’ – Starting point of limitation period for an action for recovery of the tax – Date when invoice
                  is issued or date when the tax return in which the taxable person claims his right to deduct tax is lodged?
               
Operative part 
Article of Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of May on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating
         to turnover taxes – Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment, as amended by Council Directive 2002/38/EC
         of May 2002, must be interpreted as meaning that it does not preclude national legislation and administrative practice fixing
         the starting point of the limitation period for an action for recovery of improperly deducted value added tax as the day on
         which the taxable person lodged the VAT return in which he claimed for the first time a right to deduct.
