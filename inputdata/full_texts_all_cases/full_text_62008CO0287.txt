Order of the Court (Fifth Chamber) of October – Savia and Others v Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della
            Ricerca and Others
(Case C‑287/08)
Reference for a preliminary ruling – No link with Community law – Clear lack of jurisdiction of the Court
Preliminary rulings – Jurisdiction of the Court – Limits (Art. EC) (see paras 7-10)
Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Tribunale ordinario di Milano – Interpretation of Article 6(2) EU and of Article of
                  the European Convention on Human Rights – Right to a fair trial – National legislation with retroactive effect which introduces
                  changes in salary conditions under the contract of employment.
               
Operative part 
The Court of Justice of the European Communities manifestly does not have jurisdiction to answer the questions posed by the
         Tribunale ordinario di Milano by decision of June 2008.
