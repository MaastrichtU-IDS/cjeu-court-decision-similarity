Summary
. ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 974/OF THE COUNCIL MAY BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT THE EXCHANGE RATES TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THE DIFFERENCE REFERRED TO MUST BE ASSESSED ON THE BASIS OF ECONOMICALLY JUSTIFIED CRITERIA AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY IT IS OPEN TO THE COMMISSION TO LEAVE OUT OF ACCOUNT RATES WHICH IT CONSIDERS TO BE UNREPRESENTATIVE . IT FOLLOWS THAT BY SO DOING IT DOES NOT EXCEED THE MARGIN OF DISCRETION CONFERRED UPON IT IN RELATION TO THE FIXING OF COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS .  . ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 2727/IT IS ONLY IF THE COMMISSION ADOPTS MEASURES WHICH ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OPINION OF THE COMMITTEE THAT THOSE MEASURES MUST BE COMMUNICATED TO THE COUNCIL . ACCORDINGLY THE ABSENCE OF AN OPINION BY THE COMMITTEE IN NO WAY AFFECTS THE VALIDITY OF THE MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION .

( C ) FOR THE IRISH POUND AND THE POUND STERLING : THE AVERAGE RATES RECORDED EACH WORKING DAY AT NOON ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS OF THE TWO MEMBER STATES CONCERNED ' ' .    9DURING THE PERIOD FROM TO JUNE INCLUSIVE , THE IRISH POUND AND THE POUND STERLING WERE SUBJECT TO SPECULATIVE MOVEMENTS , SO THAT THE DIFFERENCE FOR THAT WEEK CHANGED BY 2.POINTS FROM THE PERCENTAGE TAKEN AS A BASIS FOR THE PRECEDING DETERMINATION .   10SINCE THE SITUATION RAPIDLY RECOVERED TOWARDS THE END OF THAT PERIOD , THE COMMISSION CONSIDERED IT APPROPRIATE TO TAKE NO ACCOUNT OF THE RECENT MOVEMENTS IN THE TWO CURRENCIES IN QUESTION AND TO MAKE NO AMENDMENT TO THE LEVEL OF THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS FIXED UP TO THAT TIME .   11ACCORDINGLY , ON JUNE THE COMMISSION ADOPTED REGULATION NO 1356/, ARTICLE OF WHICH PROVIDES :    ' ' BY WAY OF DEROGATION . . . FROM ARTICLE OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1380/, THE COMPONENTS USED TO CALCULATE . . . THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS RELATING TO MOVEMENTS IN THE IRISH POUND AND THE POUND STERLING AND APPLICABLE WITH EFFECT FROM JUNE SHALL CONTINUE TO APPLY DURING THE PERIOD COMMENCING JUNE ' ' .   12THE APPELLANT BROUGHT AN ACTION BEFORE THE COLLEGE VAN BEROEP VOOR HET BEDRIJFSLEVEN AGAINST THE RESPONDENT ' S DECISION NOT TO ALTER THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS WITH EFFECT FROM JUNE , AND THAT COURT REFERRED THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING :   . ARE THE PROVISIONS OF COMMISSION REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1356/INCOMPATIBLE WITH ARTICLES , , 2A , , OR OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 974/OF THE COUNCIL AND/OR WITH THE PROVISIONS OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1380/OF THE COMMISSION OR ELSE WITH ANY OTHER BINDING PROVISION OF COMMUNITY LAW?   IF SO IS THE SAID REGULATION THEREFORE INVALID?   . IS THE AMENDMENT MADE BY REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1356/TO THE RULES FOR THE GRANTING OF MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY WHICH IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE TREATY OR WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW WHICH IS ALSO FUNDAMENTAL TO THE TREATY :   IN ITSELF ;  OR BECAUSE OF THE ABRUPT NATURE OF THE AMENDMENT ;  OR BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE AMENDMENT RELATED SOLELY TO THE IRISH POUND AND THE POUND STERLING?   IF SO IS THE REGULATION THEREFORE INVALID?   . MUST IT BE SAID THAT IN ADOPTING REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1356/THE COMMISSION ACTED ARBITRARILY OR AT LEAST THAT IT EXPOSED TRADE AND INDUSTRY TO ARBITRARY DECISIONS AND THUS ABUSED ITS POWERS?   IF SO IS THE REGULATION THEREFORE INVALID?   . PROPERLY INTERPRETED DO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2727/OF THE COUNCIL MEAN THAT IF THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE HAS NOT DECIDED ON A DRAFT MEASURE SUBMITTED TO IT BY A MAJORITY OF VOTES THE COMMISSION IS NOT OBLIGED TO NOTIFY THE MEASURE TO THE COUNCIL?   IF THAT QUESTION IS ANSWERED IN THE NEGATIVE IS REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1356/, WHICH WAS NOT SUBMITTED TO THE COUNCIL , CONSEQUENTLY INVALID?     13THE APPELLANT EXPORTS CEREALS FROM THE NETHERLANDS TO THE UNITED KINGDOM , AND PAYMENT IS MADE IN POUNDS STERLING .   14ACCORDING TO THE APPELLANT , PAYMENT IS VERY OFTEN MADE A SHORT TIME AFTER THE DATE OF IMPORTATION UPON PRESENTATION OF DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE .   15DURING THE REFERENCE PERIOD DEFINED IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1380/OF THE COMMISSION , THE EXPORTER SEEKS TO SELL AN AMOUNT IN POUNDS STERLING EQUIVALENT TO THAT PART OF THE SELLING PRICE WHICH CORRESPONDS TO THE INTERVENTION PRICE .   16BY ACTING IN THIS WAY A PRUDENT EXPORTER MANAGES TO GUARD AGAINST ANY FALLS IN THE EXCHANGE RATE OF THE POUND STERLING BETWEEN THE REFERENCE PERIOD AND THE EXPORT PERIOD .   17THE APPELLANT SUBMITS THAT BY OMITTING TO FIX NEW MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS FOR THE PERIOD COMMENCING JUNE , REGULATION NO 1356/INVOLVLES NOT ONLY A DEROGATION FROM THE PROVISIONS OF REGULATION NO 1380/, BUT ALSO AND PRINCIPALLY A DEROGATION FROM THOSE OF REGULATION NO 974/, IN PARTICULAR ARTICLE ( ) ( PERIOD TO BE DETERMINED ) AND ARTICLE OF THAT REGULATION .   18IT IS SUBMITTED THAT SINCE THE LATTER IS A COUNCIL REGULATION , THE COMMISSION CANNOT DEROGATE FROM IT .   19FURTHERMORE , REGULATION NO 1356/IS SAID TO VIOLATE THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY .   20ACCORDING TO THE APPELLANT , BY RELYING ON THE SYSTEM EMBODIED IN REGULATION NO 974/EXPORTERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE ON THE BASIS OF THE PERCENTAGE FLUCTUATION DURING THE REFERENCE PERIOD FROM TO JUNE INCLUSIVE THEMSELVES TO CALCULATE THE VALUE OF THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE APPLIED TO TRADE WITH THE UNITED KINDGOM WITH EFFECT FROM JUNE AND TO BASE THEIR TRANSACTIONS ON THAT VALUE .   21FURTHERMORE , REGULATION NO 1356/IS SAID TO BE CONTRARY TO THE SYSTEM EMBODIED IN REGULATIONS NOS 974/AND 1380/IN THAT IT RELATES ONLY TO THE POUND STERLING AND THE IRISH POUND AND NOT TO THE OTHER CURRENCIES , SO THAT MERCHANTS EXPORTING TO ITALY OR FRANCE ARE NOT AFFECTED , AND THIS IS SAID TO RESULT IN A VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW .   22FOR THE REFERENCE PERIOD FROM MAY TO JUNE THE AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES OF THE POUND STERLING SHOWED A REAL DIFFERENCE OF - 22.37% , THAT IS TO SAY A DIFFERENCE OF - 20.87% FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE SECOND INDENT OF ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) OF REGULATION NO 974/.    23SINCE THE DIFFERENCE TAKEN AS THE BASIS FOR THE PRECEDING DETERMINATION WAS - 19.2% , THE CHANGE IN THE DIFFERENCE PROMPTED THE COMMISSION TO FIX THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS FOR THE PERIOD COMMENCING ON JUNE ON THE BASIS OF AN ADJUSTED DIFFERENCE OF - 20.9% IN ITS REGULATION NO 1312/OF JUNE ALTERING THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ).   24THE MOVEMENTS IN THE REAL DIFFERENCE DURING THE PERIOD FROM JUNE TO JUNE WERE THE FOLLOWING :    DATE REAL DIFFERENCE  JUNE - 22.JUNE - 25.JUNE - 25.JUNE - 26.JUNE - 25.JUNE - 22.25ON THE LAST OF THOSE DATES , THE DIFFERENCE WAS LESS THAN THAT ON JUNE , AND IN THE DAYS PRECEDING THE ADOPTION OF REGULATION NO 1356/OF JUNE , THE DIFFERENCE NEVER REACHED A LEVEL APPROACHING THAT OF JUNE .    26CONSEQUENTLY , THE COMMISSION WAS ABLE TO STATE IN THE THIRD RECITAL IN THE PREAMBLE TO THE SAID REGULATION THAT ' ' THOSE RATES HAVE SINCE IMPROVED , THUS ELIMINATING THE DISPARITY RECORDED IN THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PERIOD ' ' .   27IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES , THE COMMISSION CONSIDERED IT ' ' APPROPRIATE TO TAKE NO ACCOUNT ' '  OF THE RATES RECORDED DURING THE PERIOD COMMENCING ON JUNE ' ' AND TO MAKE NO AMENDMENT FOR THE PRESENT TO THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS . . . RELATING TO THE CURRENCIES IN QUESTION ' ' .   28HOWEVER , ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 974/OF THE COUNCIL PROVIDES THAT IF THE DIFFERENCE REFERRED TO CHANGES BY AT LEAST POINT FROM THE PERCENTAGE TAKEN AS A BASIS FOR THE PRECEDING DETERMINATION , THE COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS SHALL BE ALTERED BY THE COMMISSION IN LINE WITH THE CHANGE IN THE DIFFERENCE .   29THE AVERAGE ADJUSTED DIFFERENCE WHICH WAS TO BE RECORDED FOR THE REFERENCE PERIOD FROM JUNE TO JUNE WAS - 23.59% AND DIVERGED BY 2.POINTS FORM THE PERCENTAGE TAKEN AS A BASIS FOR THE PRECEDING DETERMINATION .   30THEREFORE IT APPEARS THAT BY OMITTING TO FIX NEW COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS THE COMMISSION DEPARTED FROM THE PROVISIONS OF THE SAID ARTICLE , AND IT SHOULD BE EXAMINED WHETHER IT COULD LEGALLY DO SO .   31IT APPEARS FROM THE PREAMBLE TO REGULATION NO 974/THAT THE SYSTEM OF MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS WAS INTRODUCED IN ORDER TO OBVIATE THE RISK OF DISRUPTION FOR THE INTERVENTION SYSTEM AND ABNORMAL MOVEMENTS OF PRICES JEOPARDIZING A NORMAL TREND OF BUSINESS IN ARGRICULTURE .   32ACCORDING TO THE LAST RECITAL IN THE PREAMBLE TO THE SAID REGULATION ' ' THE COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS SHOULD BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNTS STRICTLY NECESSARY TO COMPENSATE THE INCIDENCE OF THE MONETARY MEASURES ON THE PRICES OF BASIC PRODUCTS COVERED BY INTERVENTION ARRANGEMENTS AND . . . IT IS APPROPRIATE TO APPLY THEM ONLY IN CASES WHERE THIS INCIDENCE WOULD LEAD TO DIFFICULTIES ' ' .   33CONSEQUENTLY IT MUST BE CONSIDERED WHETHER , WHERE A DIFFERENCE IN THE EXCHANGE RATE IS RECORDED OVER A SHORT PERIOD AND WHERE BEFORE THE DATE LAID DOWN FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THE COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS IN RESPECT OF THAT DIFFERENCE THE EXCHANGE RATE IMPROVES TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THERE IS NO LONGER ANY REASON TO FEAR RISKS TO THE INTERVENTION SYSTEM OR ABNORMAL MOVEMENTS OF PRICES , THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS SYSTEM REQUIRES THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THAT IMPROVEMENT THE COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS MUST BE ALTERED IN LINE WITH THE DIFFERENCE RECORDED DURING THAT PERIOD .   34AS REGARDS TRADE WITH THE COUNTRY WHOSE CURRENCY HAD DEPRECIATED FOR A FEW DAYS DURING THE REFERENCE PERIOD , THE EFFECT OF SUCH AN ALTERATION WOULD BE THAT IMPORTS CARRIED OUT DURING THE PERIOD OF APPLICATION OF THE NEW COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS WOULD ENJOY MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS AT A LEVEL WHICH WAS NOT JUSTIFIED BY THE EXCHANGE RATES APPLICABLE ON THE DAY OF IMPORTATION , AND THAT EQUALLY UNJUSTIFIED MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS WOULD BE IMPOSED ON EXPORTS .   35IT EMERGES FROM THE PREAMBLE TO REGULATION NO 974/OF THE COUNCIL THAT SUCH A RESULT WOULD BE CONTRARY TO THE PURPOSE AND THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS SYSTEM INTRODUCED BY THAT REGULATION .   36ACCORDINGLY , ARTICLE OF THE REGULATION MAY BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT THE EXCHANGE RATES TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THE DIFFERENCE REFERRED TO MUST BE ASSESSED ON THE BASIS OF ECONOMICALLY JUSTIFIED CRITERIA , AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS OPEN TO THE COMMISSION TO LEAVE OUT OF ACCOUNT RATES WHICH IT CONSIDERED TO BE UNREPRESENTATIVE .   37IT FOLLOWS THAT BY SO DOING IT DID NOT EXCEED THE MARGIN OF DISCRETION CONFERRED UPON IT IN RELATION TO THE FIXING OF COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS .   38THE FOREGOING ALSO ANSWERS THE APPELLANT ' S ARGUMENT TO THE EFFECT THAT BY ADOPTING THE REGULATION AT ISSUE THE COMMISSION FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF ITS REGULATION NO 1380/WHICH FIXES THE REFERENCE PERIOD .   39AS REGARDS THE ALLEGED BREACH OF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY , ALTHOUGH AN EXPORTER IS ENTITLED TO TRY TO GUARD AGAINST ANY CHANGES IN THE EXCHANGE RATES IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED BY THE APPELLANT , IT SHOULD BE OBSERVED THAT THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS SYSTEM HAS THE OBJECTIVES STATED ABOVE AND WAS NOT INTENDED TO GIVE TRADERS AN EXCHANGE GUARANTEE OR TO INDEMNIFY THEM AGAINST ANY LOSS .   40AS REGARDS THE ALLEGED BREACH OF THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW , IT SUFFICES TO OBSERVE THAT IN A CASE SUCH AS THE PRESENT , IN WHICH IT APPEARS THAT ALTERATION OF THE COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS ON THE BASIS OF STATISTICS APPLYING TO ONE MEMBER STATE WOULD NOT BE ECONOMICALLY JUSTIFIED , THERE IS NOTHING IN THAT PRINCIPLE TO PREVENT THE APPLICATION TO OTHER MEMBER STATES OF THE RATE OF COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS WHICH IS ECONOMICALLY JUSTIFIED .   41THE FOURTH QUESTION ASKS WHETHER COMMISSION REGULATION NO . 1356/IS INVALID BECAUSE THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE DID NOT DECIDE IN FAVOUR OF THE MEASURE ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION AND THE COMMISSION DID NOT COMMUNICATE THE MEASURE ADOPTED TO THE COUNCIL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 2727/OF THE COUNCIL OF OCTOBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ).   42ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 974/PROVIDES THAT DETAILED RULES FOR THE APPLICATION OF THAT REGULATION SHALL BE ADOPTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURE LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE OF COUNCIL REGULATION NO 120/ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN CEREALS , AS LAST AMENDED BY REGULATION NO 2434/, OR , IF APPROPRIATE , THE CORRESPONDING ARTICLE OF THE OTHER REGULATIONS ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF AGRICULTURAL MARKETS .   43REGULATION NO 120/WAS REPEALED AND REPLACED BY REGUALTION NO 2727/, ARTICLE OF WHICH CORRESPONDS TO ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 120/AND PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS :    ' ' . WHERE THE PROCEDURE LAID DOWN IN THIS ARTICLE IS TO BE FOLLOWED , THE CHAIRMAN SHALL REFER THE MATTER TO THE COMMITTEE , EITHER ON HIS OWN INITIATIVE OR AT THE REQUEST OF THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A MEMBER STATE .   . THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMMISSION SHALL SUBMIT A DRAFT OF THE MEASURES TO BE ADOPTED . THE COMMITTEE SHALL DELIVER ITS OPINION ON THE DRAFT WITHIN A TIME-LIMIT SET BY THE CHAIRMAN ACCORDING TO THE URGENCY OF THE MATTER . AN OPINION SHALL BE DELIVERED BY A MAJORITY OF VOTES .   . THE COMMISSION SHALL ADOPT MEASURES WHICH SHALL APPLY IMMEDIATELY . HOWEVER , IF THESE MEASURES ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OPINION OF THE COMMITTEE , THEY SHALL FORTHWITH BE COMMUNICATED BY THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL . IN THAT EVENT THE COMMISSION MAY DEFER APPLICATION OF THE MEASURES WHICH IT HAS ADOPTED FOR NOT MORE THAN ONE MONTH FROM THE DATE OF SUCH COMMUNICATION .  THE COUNCIL , ACTING BY A QUALIFIED MAJORITY , MAY TAKE A DIFFERENT DECISION WITHIN ONE MONTH . ' '    44IT APPEARS FROM THE LAST RECITAL IN THE PREAMBLE TO REGULATION NO 1356/THAT THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE DID NOT DELIVER AN OPINION WITHIN THE TIME-LIMIT SET BY ITS CHAIRMAN .   45ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 2727/, IT IS ONLY IF THE COMMISSION ADOPTS MEASURES WHICH ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OPINION OF THE COMMITTEE THAT THOSE MEASURES MUST BE COMMUNICATED TO THE COUNCIL .   46ACCORDINGLY THE ABSENCE OF AN OPINION BY THE COMMITTEE IN NO WAY AFFECTS THE VALIDITY OF THE MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION .   47THEREFORE THE ANSWER TO ALL THE QUESTIONS RAISED SHOULD BE THAT CONSIDERATION OF COMMISSION REGULATION NO 1356/HAS DISCLOSED NO FACTOR OF SUCH A KIND AS TO AFFECT ITS VALIDITY .
