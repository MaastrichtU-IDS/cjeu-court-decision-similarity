IN CASE 129/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE ITALIAN CORTE SUPREMA DI CASSAZIONE ( SUPREME COURT OF CASSATION ), SECOND CIVIL DIVISION , FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE PROCEEDINGS PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  FRATELLI FANCON , MONTE DI MALO ,   AND  SOCIETA INDUSTRIALE AGRICOLA TRESSE ( SIAT ), QUARTO D ' ALTINO ,   
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 136/66/EEC OF THE COUNCIL OF SEPTEMBER ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMON ORGANIZ    ATION OF THE MARKET IN OILS AND FATS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION , 1965-, P . ).  
Grounds
BY ORDER OF JANUARY , RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON MAY , THE CORTE SUPREMA DI CASSAZIONE ( SUPREME COURT OF CASSATION ), SECOND CIVIL DIVISION , REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY A QUESTION CONCERNING THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 136/66/EEC OF THE COUNCIL OF SEPTEMBER ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN OILS AND FATS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION , 1965-, P . ).   THIS QUESTION IS RAISED IN THE CONTEXT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN TWO ITALIAN UNDERTAKINGS ONE OF WHICH BOUGHT FROM THE OTHER BRAZILIAN FLOUR EXTRACTED FROM SOYA WHICH WAS TO BE DELIVERED BETWEEN THE END OF JULY AND SEPTEMBER . DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE CONCLUSION OF THE CONTRACT AND THE COMMENCEMENT OF ITS PERFORMANCE THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT PROMULGATED DECREE-LAW NO OF JULY ( GAZZETTA UFFICIALE NO OF JULY ), CONVERTED INTO LAW NO OF AUGUST , RELATING TO THE REGULATION OF THE PRICES TO BE APPLIED BY UNDERTAKINGS OF A CERTAIN SCALE . THE DISPUTE TURNS ON THE QUESTION WHETHER THE CONTRACT MUST BE PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS STIPULATED IN IT OR WHETHER THOSE TERMS MUST BE REVISED ON THE BASIS OF DECREE-LAUW NO .    THE SOLUTION OF THIS PROBLEM DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE PRODUCT AT ISSUE . IF IT IS COVERED BY A COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET THE MEMBER STATES MAY NO LONGER INTERFERE , THROUGH NATIONAL PROVISIONS ADOPTED UNILATERALLY , IN THE MACHINERY OF PRICE-FORMATION AS ESTABLISHED UNDER THE COMMON ORGANIZATION .       IT WAS THIS PRECEPT , DERIVED FROM THE CASE-LAW OF THE COURT ( JUDGMENT OF JANUARY IN CASE 31/GALLI ( ) ECR ) WHICH LED THE CORTE SUPREMA DI CASSAZIONE TO ASK THE COURT OF JUSTICE ' ' WHETHER OR NOT FLOUR EXTRACTED FROM SOYA IS INCLUDED IN THE LIST OF PRODUCTS SET OUT IN ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 136/66/EEC OF THE COUNCIL OF SEPTEMBER , IN PARTICULAR UNDER HEADINGS 12., EX 15.OR EX 23.OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF ' ' .   REGULATION NO 136/66/EEC IS THE BASIC COMMUNITY TEXT WHICH ESTABLISHED A COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN OILS AND FATS . ARTICLE ( ) OF THE REGULATION LISTS THE PRODUCTS IN THE SECTOR OF OIL SEEDS AND OLEAGINOUS FRUIT WHICH COME WITHIN THAT PROVISION BY CLASSIFYING THEM UNDER A NUMBER OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF .   THE THREE HEADINGS SPECIFIED BY THE NATIONAL COURT WERE , AT THE MATERIAL TIME , WORDED IN REGULATION NO 1/OF DECEMBER RELATING TO THE COMMON CUSTUMS TARIFF ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) AS FOLLOWS :    ' ' 12.: FLOURS OR MEALS OF OIL SEEDS OR OLEAGINOUS FRUIT , NON-DEFATTED , ( EXCLUDING MUSTARD FLOUR ):   A . OF SOYA BEANS  B . OTHER  EX 15.17:RESIDUES RESULTING FROM THE TREATMENT OF FATTY SUBSTANCES OR ANIMAL OR VEGETABLE WAXES :   A . CONTAINING OIL HAVING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF OLIVE OIL :    I . SOAPSTOCKS  II . OTHER  B.OTHER :    I . OIL FOOTS AND DREGS ; SOAPSTOCKS  II . OTHER      EX 23.04OIL-CAKE AND OTHER RESIDUES ( EXCEPT DREGS ) RESULTING FROM THE EXTRACTION OF VEGEBABLE OILS :   A.OIL-CAKE AND OTHER RESIDUES RESULTING FROM THE EXTRACTION OF OLIVE OIL  B.OTHER . ' '    IT MUST FIRST BE NOTED THAT SOYA SEEDS COME WITHIN THIS COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN OILS AND FATS BECAUSE THEY ARE OIL SEEDS MENTIONED , GENERICALLY , IN HEADING 12.OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF , WHICH APPEARS IN ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 136/66/EEC .    IT IS THEN NECESSARY TO EXAMINE EACH TARIFF HEADING MENTIONED BY THE NATIONAL COURT FOR THE PURPOSES OF ASCERTAINING WHETHER OR NOT FLOUR EXTRACTED FROM SOYA COMES WITHIN ONE OF THEM .   IT IS AN UNDISPUTED FACT THAT THE INDUSTRIAL TREATMENT OF SOYA SEEDS YIELDS SEVERAL PRODUCTS INCLUDING FLOUR EXTRACTED FROM SOYA WHICH IS A PRODUCT RICH IN PROTEINS WHOSE INTENDED USE IS AS A FEEDINGSTUFF FOR CATTLE . IT OWES ITS NUTRITIVE QUALITY , WHICH IS USEFUL FOR THE PRODUCTION OF MEAT , TO THIS CHARACTERISTIC AND TO THE FACT THAT MOST OF THE OIL HAS BEEN EXTRACTED BY PRESSURE OR BY THE USE OF SOLVENTS .   HEADING 12.CANNOT APPLY TO FLOUR EXTRACTED FROM SOYA BECAUSE ITS MANUFACTURE YIELDS A DEFATTED PRODUCT . ACCORDING TO THE WORDING OF THE HEADING AND THE EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE CUSTOMS COOPERATIONAL COUNCIL NOMENCLATURE ONLY FLOURS OR MEALS OF OIL SEEDS AND OLEAGINOUS FRUIT , NON-DEFATTED , COME UNDER THE HEADING .   SINCE HEADING EX 15.REFERS ONLY TO RESIDUES RESULTING FROM THE TREATMENT OF FATTY SUBSTANCES , IT , TOO , CANNOT APPLY TO FLOUR EXTRACTED FROM SOYA , AS THAT HEADING REFERS TO RESIDUES RESULTING FROM THE TREATMENT OF FATTY SUBSTANCES WHICH CANNOT BE USED FOR FEEDING CATTLE , WHICH IS A CHARACTERISTIC QUALITY OF FLOUR EXTRACTED FROM SOYA .       ON THE OTHER HAND , HEADING EX 23.REFERS TO OIL-CAKE AND OTHER RESIDUES WHICH , ACCORDING TO THE ABOVE-MENTIONED NOMENCLATURE , ARE ' ' THE SOLID RESIDUES REMAINING AFTER THE EXTRACTION OF OIL FROM OIL SEEDS . . . BY SOLVENTS OR IN A PRESS OR ROTARY EXPELLER ' ' , WHICH IS THE TREATMENT USED TO OBTAIN FLOUR EXTRACTED FROM SOYA .   CLASSIFICATION OF FLOUR EXTRACTED FROM SOYA UNDER HEADING EX 23.HAS GIVEN RISE TO THE OBJECTION , ON THE ONE HAND , THAT THIS FLOUR IS NOT TOTALLY DEFATTED AND THAT IT THEREFORE CANNOT BE DEFINED AS THE RESIDUE RESULTING FROM THE EXTRACTION OF A FATTY SUBSTANCE AND , ON THE OTHER HAND , TO THE OBJECTION THAT IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A RESIDUE BUT THE MAIN PRODUCT RESULTING FROM THE DEFATTING PROCESS .   IT IS APPROPRIATE TO REPLY TO THE FIRST OF THESE OBJECTIONS THAT THE DEFATTING PROCESS IS TAKEN AS FAR AS TECHNOLOGY MAKES POSSIBLE AND THAT THE PRESENCE OF TRIFLING QUANTITIES OF RESIDUAL OIL DOES NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE QUALITY OF A FLOUR WHOSE MAIN PROPERTY IS THE PRESENCE OF PROTEINS OF HIGH NUTRITIVE VALUE FOR CATTLE . THE SECOND OBJECTION MUST BE REFUTED ON THE GROUND THAT THE TERM ' ' RESIDUE ' '  IS NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THAT OF ' ' WASTE ' ' , AS IS SHOWN BY THE WORDING OF HEADING EX . 23.WHICH EXCLUDES ' ' DREGS ' ' , WHICH ARE VIRTUALLY WORTHLESS SUBSTANCES , WHEREAS FLOUR EXTRACTED FROM SOYA IS THE RESIDUE OF SOYA SEEDS REMAINING AFTER THE INDUSTRIAL TREATMENT OF THE SEEDS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THAT PRODUCT .   IT MUST THEREFORE BE CONCLUDED THAT FLOUR EXTRACTED FROM SOYA MUST BE CLASSIFIED IN HEADING EX 23.OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF AND THAT IT IS THEREFORE INCLUDED AMONG THE PRODUCTS LISTED IN ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 136/66/EEC OF THE COUNCIL ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN OILS AND FATS .   IN VIEW OF THIS CLASSIFICATION OF FLOUR EXTRACTED FROM SOYA , ANY EXAMINATION OF OTHER HEADINGS TO WHICH THE REGULATION REFERS WOULD BE PURPOSELESS .
