Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON MARCH THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION BEFORE THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT BY NOT COMPLYING WITH THE JUDGMENT GIVEN BY THE COURT ON NOVEMBER IN CASE 322/( COMMISSION V ITALY (( )) ECR ), THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAD FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY .  IN THAT JUDGMENT THE COURT DECLARED THAT :  "THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC, BY NOT EFFECTING QUALITY CONTROLS OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLES MARKETED WITHIN ITALIAN TERRITORY AS REQUIRED UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1035/OF THE COUNCIL OF MAY ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN FRUIT AND VEGETABLES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL, ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P.*) AND BY NOT PROVIDING MONTHLY STATEMENTS RELATING TO THE INSPECTIONS CARRIED OUT DURING THE PREVIOUS MONTH, AS REQUIRED BY ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2638/OF THE COMMISSION OF DECEMBER LAYING DOWN ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS ON QUALITY CONTROL OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLES MARKETED WITHIN THE COMMUNITY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL, ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P.*), AS AMENDED BY COMMISSION REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2150/OF JULY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L 210, P.*), HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY ."  REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING FOR THE BACKGROUND TO THE DISPUTE AND THE SUBMISSIONS AND ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES WHICH ARE MENTIONED OR DISCUSSED HEREINAFTER ONLY IN SO FAR AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE REASONING OF THE COURT .  THE COMMISSION CONSIDERED THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAD NOT GIVEN EFFECT TO THE COURT' S JUDGMENT OF NOVEMBER AND COMMENCED THE PROCEDURE PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY . AFTER REQUESTING THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC TO SUBMIT ITS OBSERVATIONS IT DELIVERED A REASONED OPINION ON SEPTEMBER . WHEN NO REPLY TO THAT OPINION WAS RECEIVED, IT BROUGHT THIS ACTION .  THE COMMISSION SUBMITS THAT, FOLLOWING THE JUDGMENT OF NOVEMBER 1983, THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC WAS REQUIRED BY ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY TO TAKE THE NECESSARY MEASURES TO BRING TO AN END THE FAILURE TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY BY COMPLYING WITH REGULATION NO 1035/OF THE COUNCIL AND COMMISSION REGULATIONS NOS 2638/AND 2150/. THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS NOT COMPLIED WITH THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT .  THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT STATES THAT, WITH A VIEW TO COMPLYING WITH REGULATION NO 1035/OF THE COUNCIL AND COMMISSION REGULATIONS NOS 2638/AND 2150/AND THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF NOVEMBER 1983, IT HAS UNDERTAKEN A STUDY AND DRAWN UP A DETAILED PLAN OF ACTION . IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THAT PLAN, IT HAS INSERTED IN THE DRAFT PLURENNIAL LAW FOR THE CARRYING OUT OF PLANNED INTERVENTIONS IN AGRICULTURE, LAID BEFORE THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES ON MARCH 1986, A PROVISION FOR THE CREATION OF THE STRUCTURES NEEDED FOR THE INSPECTIONS WHICH IT MUST CARRY OUT AND FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION WHICH IT IS REQUIRED TO UNDERTAKE UNDER THE AFORESAID REGULATIONS . AT THE HEARING THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT INDICATED THAT, UNFORTUNATELY, OWING TO VARIOUS DIFFICULTIES, IT HAD STILL NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO ENACT THAT LAW .  IT MUST BE POINTED OUT IN THIS REGARD THAT THE COURT HAS CONSISTENTLY HELD THAT A MEMBER STATE CANNOT RELY ON PROVISIONS, PRACTICES OR SITUATIONS IN ITS INTERNAL LEGAL ORDER TO JUSTIFY ITS FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER COMMUNITY LAW . IN ITS JUDGMENT OF NOVEMBER THE COURT HELD THAT IN NOT CARRYING OUT THE QUALITY CONTROLS AND NOT PROVIDING MONTHLY STATEMENTS RELATING TO THE INSPECTIONS CARRIED OUT UNDER THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF REGULATION NO 1035/OF THE COUNCIL AND REGULATION NO 2638/OF THE COMMISSION, AS AMENDED BY REGULATION NO 2150/80, THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAD FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY .  ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY DOES NOT SPECIFY THE PERIOD WITHIN WHICH A JUDGMENT MUST BE COMPLIED WITH . HOWEVER, IT IS BEYOND DISPUTE THAT THE ACTION REQUIRED TO GIVE EFFECT TO A JUDGMENT MUST BE SET IN MOTION IMMEDIATELY AND BE COMPLETED IN THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE PERIOD . IN THE PRESENT CASE, SUCH PERIOD HAS BEEN GREATLY EXCEEDED .  IT MUST THEREFORE BE DECLARED THAT BY FAILING TO COMPLY WITH THE JUDGMENT DELIVERED BY THE COURT ON NOVEMBER IN CASE 322/82, THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY .  
Decision on costs
