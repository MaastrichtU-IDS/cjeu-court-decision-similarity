Summary
Officials – Remuneration – Expatriation allowance – Conditions for granting 
(Staff Regulations of Officials, Annex VII, Art. 4(1)(a)) 
The concept of ‘State’ for the purposes of the last sentence of the second indent of Article 4(1)(a) of Annex VII to the Staff
         Regulations necessarily includes the permanent representation of a Member State to the European Union. Therefore, the members
         of the staff of such a permanent representation, including its administrative and technical staff, must, since they are part
         of the structures of that representation, be considered to be working for the Member State concerned and, consequently, to
         be in a situation of ‘expatriation’ within the meaning of the above provision, regardless of the particular and specific functions
         carried out within that body, since entitlement to the expatriation allowance is not conditional upon the existence of a direct
         legal tie linking the person concerned and the State at issue. Such an interpretation is, moreover, consistent with the autonomy
         enjoyed by the Member States in the internal organisation of their permanent representations. It is for each Member State
         to determine which bodies will form part of its permanent representation and to identify the public interests which the various
         bodies coexisting with the permanent representation must promote in relations with the Community institutions.
