REFUSED THE OFFER OF AN APPOINTMENT IN THE SERVICES OF THE COMMISSION WITH ASSIGNMENT TO LUXEMBOURG THE THIRD SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATE ACCEPTED IT AND WAS DULY APPOINTED .   5WHEN SUBSEQUENTLY IN THE COURSE OF TWO POSTS FOR TRANSLATORS OF FRENCH MOTHER TONGUE BECAME VACANT IN THE SERVICES OF THE COMMISSION IN BRUSSELS MISS F . WAS APPOINTED TO ONE OF THEM WHILE THE OTHER WAS FILLED BY THE TRANSFER TO BRUSSELS OF AN OFFICIAL EMPLOYED IN LUXEMBOURG .   6ALTHOUGH THE FINAL DATE FOR THE VALIDITY OF THE LIST OF SUITABLE CANDIDATES DRAWN UP IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED INTERNAL COMPETITION WAS DEFERRED FROM DECEMBER TO FEBRUARY THE APPLICANT REMAINED AFTER THE EXPIRY OF THAT PERIOD THE ONLY SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATE IN THAT COMPETITION NOT TO HAVE BEEN APPOINTED TO A POST OF ASSISTANT TRANSLATOR .   7BY A COMPLAINT BY WAY OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS SUBMITTED TO THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY ON MAY THE APPLICANT STATED THAT THE DECISION NOT TO APPOINT HER TO A POST OF ASSISTANT TRANSLATOR IN BRUSSELS CONSTITUTED DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT AND IS THEREFORE AN ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING HER .   8SHE REQUESTED THAT THAT SITUATION BE REMEDIED AND THAT SHE BE APPOINTED ' ' TO A POST OF ASSISTANT TRANSLATOR IN THE TRANSLATION DEPARTMENT . . . IN BRUSSELS , IN THE SAME WAY AS THE OTHER SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATE OF FRENCH MOTHER TONGUE IN INTERNAL COMPETITION NO COM/LA/11/' ' .   9SINCE NO REPLY WAS RECEIVED TO THAT COMPLAINT , ON DECEMBER THE APPLICANT LODGED THE PRESENT APPLICATION WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON DECEMBER . THE APPLICATION SEEKS THE ANNULMENT OF THE IMPLIED DECISION REJECTING THE COMPLAINT AS WELL AS OF THE REFUSAL OF THE COMMISSION EITHER TO PROMOTE THE APPLICANT TO A POST OF ASSISTANT TRANSLATOR IN CAREER BRACKET L/A 8-LA OR TO EXTEND FURTHER THE DURATION OF VALIDITY OF THE COMPETITION .   10IN SUPPORT OF HER CONCLUSIONS THE APPLICANT MAINTAINS IN PARTICULAR THAT THE COMMISSION HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THE NORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF HER CAREER AS WELL AS , ON A MORE GENERAL LEVEL , ITS OBLIGATIONS DERIVING FROM ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   11SHE COMPLAINS IN PARTICULAR THAT THE COMMISSION FAILED TO TAKE HER ADVANCED VOCATIONAL TRAINING INTO ACCOUNT ( IN THIS INSTANCE DULY CERTIFIED FURTHER EDUCATION AT UNIVERSITY LEVEL ) WHEN FILLING THE TWO POSTS WHICH BECAME VACANT IN .    12IT IS CLEAR FROM THE TERMS OF THE FINAL PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS THAT THE TRAINING AND INSTRUCTION OF OFFICIALS SHALL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FOR PURPOSES OF PROMOTION IN THEIR CAREERS .   13IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY ORGANIZED AN INTERNAL COMPETITION FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONSTITUTING A RESERVE TO FILL VACANT POSTS IN CAREER BRACKET L/A 8-L/A AND THAT THE APPLICANT TOOK PART SUCCESSFULLY IN THE TESTS FOR THAT COMPETITION .   14AS A RESULT OF THAT COMPETITION THE APPLICANT WAS OFFERED AND REFUSED AN APPOINTMENT TO A POST IN THAT CAREER BRACKET WITH ASSIGNMENT TO LUXEMBOURG WHICH WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN HER PROMOTION FROM HER PRESENT CATEGORY TO A HIGHER CATEGORY .   15UP TO THE TIME OF THE APPLICANT ' S REFUSAL OF THAT APPOINTMENT , THEREFORE , THE COMMISSION DID NOT IN ANY WAY FAIL IN ITS OBLIGATIONS TOWARDS HER DERIVING FROM THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AS A WHOLE .   16ALTHOUGH THE APPLICANT DOES NOT CONTEST THE APPOINTMENT OF MISS F . AND HER ASSIGNMENT TO THE SERVICES OF THE COMMISSION IN BRUSSELS SHE CRITICIZES THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY FOR HAVING FAILED TO APPOINT HER IN LIKE MANNER TO ANOTHER POST OF ASSISTANT TRANSLATOR WHICH BECAME VACANT IN BRUSSELS DURING THE DURATION OF VALIDITY OF THE LIST OF SUITABLE CANDIDATES AND WHICH WAS FILLED BY THE TRANSFER OF ANOTHER OFFICIAL FROM THE SERVICES OF THE COMMISSION IN LUXEMBOURG .   17IN THAT REGARD SHE RELIES ON THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS IN ORDER , AS IT WERE , TO CLAIM A PRIOR RIGHT TO THAT POST , AS A SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATE IN AN INTERNAL COMPETITION , OVER AN OFFICIAL WISHING TO BE ASSIGNED TO IT BY WAY OF TRANSFER .   18HOWEVER , THAT ARGUMENT RECEIVES NO SUPPORT FROM THE WORDING OF ARTICLE ITSELF , WHICH ESTABLISHES THE NECESSARY RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES SO THAT VACANT POSTS MAY BE FILLED BY OFFICIALS SELECTED ON THE BASIS OF OBJECTIVE CRITERIA AND SOLELY IN THE INTERESTS OF THE SERVICE .   19IN THE LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS THE FACT THAT THE COMMISSION ' S CHOICE DID NOT FALL UPON THE APPLICANT BUT RATHER UPON AN OFFICIAL WHO WAS ALREADY EMPLOYED IN THE LANGUAGE SERVICE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE OPEN TO OBJECTIVE CRITICISM .   20THE APPLICANT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO PRODUCE ANY EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT THE CONSIDERATIONS WHICH LED TO THE FILLING OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED POST BY WAY OF TRANSFER WERE EXTRANEOUS TO THE INTERESTS OF THE SERVICE .   21IT RESULTS FROM ALL OF THE FOREGOING THAT THE FACT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DID NOT APPOINT THE APPLICANT TO A POST OF ASSISTANT TRANSLATOR DURING THE DURATION OF VALIDITY OF THE LIST OF SUITABLE CANDIDATES DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INFRINGEMENT EITHER OF ARTICLE OR OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   22AS REGARDS THE FAILURE TO EXTEND THE DURATION OF VALIDITY OF THE RESERVE LIST BEYOND FEBRUARY THE COMMISSION HAS EXPLAINED THAT AT THAT PERIOD IT INTENDED TO ORGANIZE AN OPEN COMPETITION FOR THE PURPOSE OF FILLING THE NEW POSTS ALLOCATED BY THE BUDGETARY AUTHORITY FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR , WHICH , AS REGARDS THE FRENCH LANGUAGE SECTION , INVOLVED ASSIGNMENT TO LUXEMBOURG .   23THE CONDUCT OF THE COMMISSION IN THAT REGARD , WHICH IS , MOREOVER , JUSTIFIED BY THE INTERESTS OF PROPER ADMINISTRATION , CANNOT CONSTITUTE A FAILURE TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATION TO ASSIST THE APPLICANT WHICH DERIVES FROM ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   24THERE IS , THEREFORE , NO REASON TO EXAMINE THE METHOD USED TO FILL TWO POSTS OF TRANSLATOR OF FRENCH MOTHER TONGUE IN BRUSSELS WHICH , ACCORDING TO STATEMENTS MADE BY TWO OFFICIALS OF THE COMMISSION DURING THEIR EXAMINATION BY THE COURT , BECAME VACANT DURING THE SECOND HALF OF .    25FINALLY , THE APPLICANT MAINTAINS THAT THE COMMISSION ' S REFUSAL TO APPOINT HER TO A POST OF ASSISTANT TRANSLATOR IN BRUSSELS AND TO EXTEND THE DURATION OF VALIDITY OF THE LIST OF SUITABLE CANDIDATES CONSTITUTES A MISUSE OF POWERS , SINCE IT IS BASED ON CONSIDERATIONS WHICH CONFLICT WITH THE INTERESTS OF THE SERVICE AND DERIVE , IN PARTICULAR , FROM THE OPPOSITION OF CERTAIN OFFICIALS TO THE ENTRY OF THE APPLICANT , WHO WAS RECRUITED IN CATEGORY C , INTO THE LANGUAGE SERVICE .   26IN SUPPORT OF THAT GROUND OF COMPLAINT THE APPLICANT REFERS TO VARIOUS COMPLAINTS ALLEGEDLY MADE IN THAT CONNEXION BY CERTAIN OFFICIALS OF THE COMMISSION .   27HOWEVER , THOSE ARE FACTORS WHICH CANNOT BE ADDUCED TO SUPPORT THE ARGUMENT OF A MISUSE OF POWERS ON THE PART OF THE COMMISSION .   28IN THE LIGHT OF ALL OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS THE APPLICATION MUST BE DISMISSED AS UNFOUNDED , WITH THE RESULT THAT IT IS UNNECESSARY TO CONSIDER THE QUESTION OF ADMISSIBILITY RAISED BY THE COMMISSION .
