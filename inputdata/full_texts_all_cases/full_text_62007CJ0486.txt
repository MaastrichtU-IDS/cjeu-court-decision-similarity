                  (EEC) No 1766/of June on the common organisation of the market in cereals (OJ L 181, p. 21), Article 4a of
                  Commission Regulation (EEC) No 689/of March fixing the procedure and conditions for the taking-over of cereals
                  by intervention agencies (OJ L 74, p. 18), and of Article of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/of July laying down the procedure and conditions for the sale of cereals held by intervention agencies (OJ L 191, p. 76) – Reductions
                  applicable for a moisture content higher than that of the standard quality – Application to the sale of maize.
               
Operative part
The combined provisions of Article 13(1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/of July laying down the procedure
         and conditions for the sale of cereals held by intervention agencies and Article 4a of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 689/of March fixing the procedure and conditions for the taking-over of cereals by intervention agencies, as amended by
         Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2486/of August 1992, are to be interpreted as meaning that, in the case of a sale by
         tender of maize held by the international intervention agencies, the price reductions in relation to the moisture content
         laid down for durum wheat in Table II of Annex II to Regulation No 689/92, as amended by Regulation No 2486/92, do not apply.
