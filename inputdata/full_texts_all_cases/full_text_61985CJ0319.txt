Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON OCTOBER 1985, MR MISSET ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS "THE APPLICANT "), AN OFFICIAL OF THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION OF JANUARY WHEREBY THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE COUNCIL, IN HIS CAPACITY AS APPOINTING AUTHORITY, REPRIMANDED HIM UNDER ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) AND THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS .  IT IS APPARENT FROM THE DOCUMENTS BEFORE THE COURT THAT THE APPLICANT WAS ABSENT FROM HIS PLACE OF WORK FOR THREE PERIODS DURING 1984, NAMELY FROM JULY TO AUGUST, FROM AUGUST TO SEPTEMBER AND ON SEPTEMBER . AS REGARDS THE FIRST PERIOD, THE APPLICANT WAS NOT PERMITTED TO PRODUCE A MEDICAL CERTIFICATE TO JUSTIFY HIS ABSENCE ON THE GROUND THAT IT WAS PRODUCED OUT OF TIME AND HIS APPEAL AGAINST THAT DECISION WAS DISMISSED BY THE COURT' S JUDGMENT OF JANUARY IN CASE 152/( MISSET V COUNCIL (( )) ECR ), AGAIN ON THE GROUND THAT IT WAS LODGED OUT OF TIME . THE SECOND PERIOD CONSISTED OF SPECIAL LEAVE GRANTED TO THE APPLICANT TO ATTEND A LANGUAGE COURSE IN GREECE . HE DID NOT, HOWEVER, ATTEND THE COURSE AND FAILED TO INFORM THE COUNCIL THEREOF . FINALLY, AS REGARDS SEPTEMBER, THE APPLICANT MADE AN ERROR IN THE CALCULATION OF HIS DAYS OF LEAVE .  FOLLOWING A MEETING BETWEEN THE APPLICANT AND HIS IMMEDIATE SUPERIORS ON SEPTEMBER 1984, THE LATTER SENT A MEMORANDUM TO THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY IN WHICH THEY PROPOSED TO ADOPT A DISCIPLINARY MEASURE IN RESPECT OF THE APPLICANT . ON JANUARY THE APPLICANT WAS SUMMONED BY TELEPHONE TO A MEETING THAT SAME DAY WITH THE SECRETARY-GENERAL . AT THAT MEETING THE SECRETARY-GENERAL INFORMED HIM OF HIS INTENTION, IN HIS CAPACITY AS THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY, TO IMPOSE A DISCIPLINARY MEASURE IN THE FORM OF A REPRIMAND . THAT DECISION WAS NOTIFIED IN WRITING TO THE APPLICANT ON JANUARY .  THE APPLICANT RAISES TWO SUBMISSIONS AGAINST THAT DECISION; THE FIRST RELATES TO THE PROCEDURE ADOPTED AND IS THAT HIS RIGHT TO A FAIR HEARING UNDER ARTICLE OF AND ANNEX IX TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS WAS NOT RESPECTED, AND THE SECOND RELATES TO THE STATEMENT OF REASONS ON WHICH THE DECISION WAS BASED AND ALLEGES THAT THE REASONS WERE INSUFFICIENT AND CONTRADICTORY .  REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING FOR A FULLER ACCOUNT OF THE FACTS AND THE ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES, WHICH ARE MENTIONED OR DISCUSSED HEREINAFTER ONLY IN SO FAR AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE REASONING OF THE COURT .  AS REGARDS THE PROCEDURE, THE APPLICANT COMPLAINS, IN PARTICULAR, THAT THE COUNCIL DID NOT INFORM HIM IN WRITING OF THE FACTS COMPLAINED OF AND THAT HE WAS SUMMONED TO THE MEETING WITH THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY ON JANUARY AT THE LAST MINUTE .  THIS COMPLAINT IS JUSTIFIED . AS THE COURT HAS HELD, IN PARTICULAR IN ITS JUDGMENT OF DECEMBER IN CASE 115/( DEMONT V COMMISSION (( )) ECR ), THE RIGHT TO A FAIR HEARING IN DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS MUST BE OBSERVED NOT ONLY IN THE COURSE OF PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD PURSUANT TO THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF AND ANNEX IX TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS BUT ALSO IN THE COURSE OF DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY GOVERNED BY THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE . THE RIGHT TO BE HEARD REFERRED TO IN THAT PARAGRAPH PRESUPPOSES THAT THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY HAS PREVIOUSLY INFORMED THE OFFICIAL CONCERNED OF THE COMPLAINTS AGAINST HIM AND THAT HE HAS HAD A REASONABLE TIME TO PREPARE HIS DEFENCE .  IN THIS CASE THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY HAS NOT SATISFIED THOSE CONDITIONS . THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY DID NOT INFORM THE APPLICANT OF THE COMPLAINTS AGAINST HIM BEFOREHAND, NOT EVEN BY NOTIFYING HIM OF THE MEMORANDUM SENT BY THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY TO HIS IMMEDIATE SUPERIORS AND THE TELEPHONE CALL WHICH SUMMONED THE APPLICANT TO A MEETING WITH THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY THAT SAME DAY DID NOT GIVE HIM A REASONABLE TIME TO PREPARE HIS DEFENCE .  IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WITHOUT THERE BEING ANY NEED TO EXAMINE THE OTHER OBJECTIONS TO THE DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS OR THE SUBMISSION THAT THE DECISION WAS BASED ON INSUFFICIENT REASONS, THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY' S DECISION OF JANUARY MUST BE ANNULLED .
