Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Bundespatentgericht (Germany) – Interpretation of Article of First Council Directive
                  89/104/EEC of December to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks (OJ L 40, p. 1) –
                  Examination of applications for registration of trade marks on a case-by-case basis without account being taken of earlier
                  decisions in similar situations – Refusal to register a trade mark applied for by the proprietor of a series of similar marks.
               
Operative part: 
The competent authority of a Member State called upon to rule on an application for registration of a trade mark is not required
         to disregard the grounds for refusal of registration set out in Article 3(1)(a), (b) and (c) of Council Directive 89/104/EEC
         of December to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks, as amended by Council Decision 92/10/EEC
         of December 1991, and to grant that application on the ground that the sign for which registration as a trade mark is sought
         is composed in a manner identical or comparable to a sign which it has already accepted for registration as a trade mark and
         which refers to identical or similar goods or services.
