Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION OF THE SELECTION BOARD FOR OPEN COMPETITION NO COM/LA/NOT TO ADMIT THE APPLICANT TO THAT COMPETITION , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION DATED JANUARY , WHICH WAS LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON FEBRUARY , AGATA ALAIMO , AN EMPLOYEE OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' ' THE CENTRE ' ' ) BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION OF THE SELECTION BOARD FOR OPEN COMPETITION NO COM/LA/NOT TO ADMIT THE APPLICANT TO THAT COMPETITION , WHICH WAS ORGANIZED BY THE COMMISSION TO CONSTITUTE A RESERVE OF TRANSLATORS .   AS APPEARS FROM A LETTER DATED NOVEMBER BY WHICH THE HEAD OF THE COMMISSION ' S RECRUITMENT DIVISION NOTIFIED THE APPLICANT OF THE CONTESTED DECISION , MRS ALAIMO WAS NOT ADMITTED TO THE TESTS ON THE GROUND THAT SHE EXCEEDED THE AGE-LIMIT LAID DOWN IN THE NOTICE OF COMPETITION AND IN THE OPINION OF THE SELECTION BOARD DID NOT SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS NEEDED TO BENEFIT FROM THE EXEMPTION FROM THE AGE-LIMIT EXPRESSLY GRANTED TO CANDIDATES WHO ON OCTOBER HAD BEEN ' ' EMPLOYED BY . . . THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR . ' '   THE ABOVE-MENTIONED EXEMPTION WAS BASED ON ARTICLE ( ) OF ANNEX III TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES LAYING DOWN THE PROCEDURES TO BE ADHERED TO IN COMPETITIONS , THE TERMS OF WHICH ARE AS FOLLOWS :    ' ' NOTICE OF COMPETITIONS SHALL BE DRAWN UP BY THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY AFTER CONSULTING THE JOINT COMMITTEE .  IT MUST SPECIFY :    . . .   ( G ) WHERE APPROPRIATE , THE AGE-LIMIT AND ANY EXTENSION OF THE AGE-LIMIT IN THE CASE OF SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE COMPLETED NOT LESS THAN ONE YEAR ' S SERVICE ;   . . . ' '       MRS ALAIMO CLAIMS THAT STAFF OF THE CENTRE ARE ' ' EMPLOYED BY . . . THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ' '  WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE NOTICE OF COMPETITION . SHE ADDS THAT THERE ARE NO GROUNDS FOR INTERPRETING THAT EXPRESSION AS RELATING EXCLUSIVELY TO SERVANTS OF COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS OR OF BODIES EXPRESSLY TREATED AS SUCH BY A PROVISION OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS . SHE CONCLUDES THAT BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT SHE ENTERED THE SERVICE OF THE CENTRE ON DECEMBER SHE HAS BEEN EMPLOYED BY THE COMMUNITIES SINCE THAT DATE AND THEREFORE ON OCTOBER , THE DATE OF EXPIRY OF THE PERIOD SPECIFIED FOR SUBMITTING APPLICATIONS FOR COMPETITION NO COM/LA/, SHE SATISFIED THE CONDITIONS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO BENEFIT FROM THE EXEMPTION FROM THE AGE-LIMIT .   THE COMMISSION MAINTAINS , FOR ITS PART , THAT THE EXPRESSION ' ' EMPLOYED BY . . . THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ' '  IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS MEANING ONLY OFFICIALS AND SERVANTS OF COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS OR OF BODIES EXPRESSLY TREATED AS SUCH BY A PROVISION OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   ALTHOUGH THE EXPRESSION USED IN THE NOTICE OF COMPETITION ' ' EMPLOYED BY . . . THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ' '  DIFFERS SLIGHTLY IN ITS ACTUAL WORDING FROM THE TERM APPEARING IN ARTICLE ( ) OF ANNEX III TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS ( ' ' SERVANTS ' ' ), THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE MEANING IS THE SAME IN BOTH CASES . SINCE THE DEFINITION OF ' ' SERVANT ' '  WAS NOT GIVEN IN THE ABOVE-MENTIONED ARTICLE , ITS SCOPE MUST BE DETERMINED IN THE LIGHT OF THE TOTALITY OF THE PROVISIONS IN WHICH IT APPEARS , THE PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY BEING EXAMINED FIRST . IT MAY BE SEEN THAT EACH TIME THE WORD ' ' SERVANT ' '  APPEARS IN A PROVISION OF ONE OF THE TREATIES ( FIRST SENTENCE OF THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY ; ARTICLES AND THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY ; ARTICLE AND THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EAEC TREATY ; ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TREATY ESTABLISHING A SINGLE COUNCIL AND A SINGLE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ) IT IS LINKED WITH THE WORD ' ' COMMUNITY ' ' .   THE DETERMINATION OF THIS DISPUTE THUS DEPENDS UPON THE REPLY TO BE GIVEN TO THE QUESTION WHETHER THE EXPRESSION ' ' EMPLOYED BY . . . THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ' '  ALSO EMBRACES STAFF OF THE CENTRE . IN ORDER TO REPLY TO THAT QUESTION IT IS NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE CENTRE IS PART OF THE ' ' EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ' ' .       IN THAT RESPECT IT MUST FIRST OF ALL BE POINTED OUT THAT ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 337/OF THE COUNCIL OF FEBRUARY ESTABLISHING A EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROVIDES THAT ' ' THE PROTOCOL ON THE PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES SHALL APPLY TO THE CENTRE ' ' .   THE PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES ENJOYED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES WERE CONFERRED ON THEM , AS IS STATED IN ARTICLE OF THE TREATY OF APRIL ESTABLISHING A SINGLE COUNCIL AND A SINGLE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , IN ORDER TO FACILITATE ' ' THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR TASKS ' '  AND CANNOT APPLY TO BODIES WHICH PLAY NO PART IN PERFORMING THOSE TASKS . BY STATING THAT THE PROTOCOL ON THE PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES WAS TO APPLY TO THE CENTRE , THE COUNCIL THEREBY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT HAD THE CHARACTER OF A COMMUNITY BODY .   SECONDLY , IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT UNDER THE TERMS OF ARTICLE OF COUNCIL REGULATION ( ECSC , EEC , EURATOM ) NO 1859/OF JUNE LAYING DOWN THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF STAFF OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING ' ' THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES SHALL HAVE JURISDICTION IN ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN THE CENTRE AND ANY PERSON TO WHOM THESE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT APPLY REGARDING THE LEGALITY OF AN ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING SUCH A PERSON WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) ' ' .   SINCE UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE TREATIES THE COURT ' S JURISDICTION IN STAFF ACTIONS IS LIMITED TO DISPUTES ARISING BETWEEN THE COMMUNITIES AND THEIR SERVANTS , ARTICLE AFORESAID NECESSARILY IMPLIES THAT THE CENTRE IS PART OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES .   MOREOVER , THE CENTRE WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE COUNCIL , PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY , IN ORDER THAT IT MIGHT CONTRIBUTE , BY ITS ACTIVITY , TO ACHIEVING THE OBJECTIVES OF THE COMMUNITIES AND IN PARTICULAR TO THE HARMONIOUS DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES . IT THEREFORE PLAYS A PART IN THE TASKS WHICH THE TREATIES HAVE ASSIGNED TO THE COMMUNITIES .   IN VIEW OF THE WORDING OF THE NOTICE OF COMPETITION , THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF THE CENTRE AND THE REGULATIONS OF THE COUNCIL WHICH MAKE APPLICABLE TO     THE CENTRE THE PROTOCOL ON THE PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES AND WHICH REFER ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN THE CENTRE AND ITS EMPLOYEES TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE , IT MUST BE CONCLUDED THAT THE STAFF OF THE CENTRE ARE EMPLOYED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES .   THEREFORE THE DECISION OF THE SELECTION BOARD FOR COMPETITION NO COM/LA/BY WHICH MRS ALAIMO WAS REFUSED ADMISSION TO THAT COMPETITION ON THE GROUND THAT SHE WAS NOT EMPLOYED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES MUST BE ANNULLED .   AS THIS WAS AN OPEN COMPETITION ORGANIZED TO CONSTITUTE A RESERVE FOR RECRUITMENT , THE RIGHTS OF THE APPLICANT WILL BE SUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED IF THE SELECTION BOARD RECONSIDERS ITS DECISION , WITHOUT ITS BEING NECESSARY TO QUESTION THE WHOLE OF THE RESULTS OF THE COMPETITION OR TO ANNUL APPOINTMENTS MADE IN CONSEQUENCE THEREOF .
