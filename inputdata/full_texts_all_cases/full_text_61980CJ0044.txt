Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY BY NOT IMPLEMENTING , WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD , COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 76/116/EEC OF DECEMBER ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO FERTILIZERS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) AND COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 77/535/EEC OF JUNE ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO METHODS OF SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS FOR FERTILIZERS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON FEBRUARY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT BY FAILING TO ADOPT , WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD , THE PROVISIONS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 76/116/EEC OF DECEMBER ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO FERTILIZERS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) AND COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 77/535/EEC OF JUNE ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO METHODS OF SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS FOR FERTILIZERS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE THIRD PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .   UNDER ARTICLE OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 76/116/EEC IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE OF COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 77/535/EEC , THE MEMBER STATES WERE     OBLIGED TO BRING INTO FORCE THE PROVISIONS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THOSE DIRECTIVES WITHIN A PERIOD WHICH EXPIRED ON DECEMBER .    THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DISPUTE THAT IT HAS NOT FULFILLED THOSE OBLIGATIONS . IT EXPLAINS THE DELAY IN THE INCORPORATION OF THE TWO DIRECTIVES INTO THE NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM BY THE NEED FOR THE PREPARATION AND APPROVAL OF A SPECIAL LEGISLATIVE MEASURE WHICH WILL LAY DOWN NEW RULES FOR THE ENTIRE FERTILIZER SECTOR . A DRAFT LAW HAS BEEN LAID BEFORE THE CHAMBERS AND THE PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE IS TAKING ITS COURSE . ONCE IT HAS ENTERED INTO FORCE , THAT LAW WILL ENSURE THE INCORPORATION OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 77/535/EEC INTO THE NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM .   THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES DO NOT EXPUNGE THE FAILURE TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS WITH WHICH THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC IS CHARGED . ACCORDING TO WELL-ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW , A MEMBER STATE MAY NOT PLEAD PROVISIONS , PRACTICES OR CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING IN ITS INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OBLIGATIONS AND TIME-LIMITS RESULTING FROM COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES .   IT MUST , THEREFORE , BE HELD THAT BY FAILING TO ADOPT , WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD , THE PROVISIONS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 76/116/EEC AND COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 77/535/EEC , THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ONE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY .  
Decision on costs
UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY MUST BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS IF THEY HAVE BEEN ASKED FOR IN THE SUCCESSFUL PARTY ' S PLEADING .  SINCE THE DEFENDANT HAS FAILED IN ITS SUBMISSIONS , IT MUST BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .  
Operative part
