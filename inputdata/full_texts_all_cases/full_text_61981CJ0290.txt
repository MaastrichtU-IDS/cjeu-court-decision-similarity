IN JOINED CASES AND 291/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE CORTE D ' APPELLO ( COURT OF APPEAL ), MILAN , FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE PROCEEDINGS PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  COMPAGNIA SINGER SPA ( CASE 290/) AND GEIGY SPA ( CASE 291/)   AND  AMMINISTRAZIONE DELLE FINANZE DELLO STATO ( ITALIAN STATE FINANCE ADMINISTRATION ),   
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE ( GATT ), 
Grounds
BY TWO ORDERS DATED JULY , WHICH WERE RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON NOVEMBER , THE CORTE D ' APPELLO ( COURT OF APPEAL ), MILAN , REFERRED TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY TWO QUESTIONS ON THE INTERPRETATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE OF OCTOBER ( GATT ), IN ORDER TO ENABLE IT TO DETERMINE THE COMPATIBILITY WITH THOSE PROVISIONS OF THE IMPOSITION OF THE AD VALOREM DUTY OF 0.% FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES INTRODUCED BY LAW NO OF JUNE ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' ' THE DUTY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES ' ' ).   THOSE QUESTIONS AROSE IN THE COURSE OF PROCEEDINGS PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN THE IMPORTERS , THE COMPANIES SINGER AND GEIGY , AND THE     AMMINISTRAZIONE DELLE FINANZE DELLO STATO ( ITALIAN STATE FINANCE ADMINISTRATION ) CONCERNING THE IMPOSITION OF THE DUTY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES ON VARIOUS GOODS IMPORTED FROM COUNTRIES PARTIES TO GATT BETWEEN OCTOBER AND AUGUST , THE DATE WITH EFFECT FROM WHICH THE DUTY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES WAS ABOLISHED BY LAW NO OF JUNE ( OFFICIAL GAZZETTE OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC NO OF JUNE ).   SINGER AND GEIGY , THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE MAIN ACTION IN CASES 290/AND 291/RESPECTIVELY , REQUESTED THE TRIBUNALE DI MILANO ( DISTRICT COURT , MILAN ) TO ORDER THE AMMINISTRAZIONE TO REFUND THE SUMS WHICH THEY HAD PAID IN RESPECT OF THE DUTY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES OVER THE PERIOD IN QUESTION , ON THE GROUND THAT THE CHARGES WERE CONTRARY TO THE PROVISIONS OF GATT .    THE TRIBUNALE ALLOWED THE APPLICATIONS - BASED ON ARTICLE II ( ) ( B ) OF GATT , WHICH PROHIBITS THE CONTRACTING PARTIES FROM IMPOSING CUSTOMS DUTIES IN EXCESS OF THOSE PROVIDED FOR IN THE SCHEDULES OF CONCESSIONS ANNEXED TO GATT ITSELF ( SCHEDULE XXVII FOR ITALY ) OR ANY OTHER DUTIES OR CHARGES HAVING EQUIVALENT EFFECT IN EXCESS OF THOSE INFORCE ON THE DATE OF THEIR ACCESSION TO GATT ( ON OCTOBER SO FAR AS ITALY IS CONCERNED ) - IN RELATION TO THE IMPORTATION OF GOODS LISTED IN SCHEDULE XXVII . ON THE OTHER HAND , IT DISMISSED THE APPLICATIONS IN SO FAR AS THEY SOUGHT THE REFUND OF SUMS PAID ON THE OCCASION OF THE IMPORTATION OF PRODUCTS NOT CONTAINED IN SCHEDULE XXVII BUT NONE THE LESS INCLUDED IN THE SUBSEQUENT SCHEDULE , XL ( EEC ), WHICH WAS SUBSTITUTED BY THE GENEVA PROTOCOL OF JULY FOR THE ORIGINAL NATIONAL SCHEDULES OF THE COUNTRIES WITHIN THE COMMUNITY , WITH EFFECT FROM JANUARY IN THE CASE OF ITALY .   AFTER THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE MAIN ACTION HAD APPEALED AGAINST THOSE DECISIONS , THE CORTE D ' APPELLO , MILAN , REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS , IDENTICAL IN THE TWO CASES :    ' ' . BY VIRTUE OF THE MATTERS SET FORTH IN THE PREAMBLE TO GATT , BOTH IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM , IN WHICH THE CONTRACTING STATES DECLARED THEMSELVES DESIROUS OF REDUCING CUSTOMS TARIFFS AND OTHER OBSTACLES TO TRADE AND OF ELIMINATING DISCRIMINATION IN INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE , AND IN THE FORM ADOPTED PURSUANT TO THE GENEVA PROTOCOL OF MARCH , WHICH ITALY     RATIFIED BY LAW NO OF NOVEMBER , IN WHICH THE CONTRACTING STATES , BY USING THE WORD ' DESIRING ' , UNDERTOOK THE ABOVE-MENTIONED COMMITMENTS , MAY THE CHARGE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES ESTABLISHED BY LAW NO OF JUNE ( AFTER ITALY ' S ACCESSION TO THE GATT BUT PRIOR TO THE GENEVA PROTOCOL ) BE REGARDED AS COMPATIBLE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF GATT , REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THE IMPORTED GOODS ARE INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL SCHEDULES OF CONCESSIONS AND REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT IN THE CLAUSE PROHIBITING INCREASE OF THE PRE-EXISTING INDIRECT CHARGES ON IMPORTS EXPRESS TEXTUAL REFERENCE IS MADE ONLY TO THOSE GOODS?    2.AS A RESULT OF THE SUBSTITUTION OF SCHEDULE XL ( COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF ) FOR SCHEDULE XXVII , IS THE PROHIBITION OF THE INCREASE OF PRE-EXISTING INDIRECT CHARGES ON IMPORTS CONTAINED IN ARTICLE II ( ) ( B ) OF GATT COMPATIBLE , AS FROM THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THAT SUBSTITUTION ( JANUARY IN THE CASE OF ITALY ), WITH THE CHARGE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES ALREADY IN FORCE IF APPLIED TO GOODS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL SCHEDULE XXVII AND INCLUDED ONLY IN SCHEDULE XL?  ' '   THOSE QUESTIONS ARE IN SUBSTANCE IDENTICAL TO THE QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY THE CORTE SUPREMA DI CASSAZIONE ( SUPREME COURT OF CASSATION ) IN JOINED CASES TO 269/( SOCIETA PETROLIFERA ITALIANA AND MICHELIN ), IN WHICH A JUDGMENT HAS TODAY BEEN DELIVERED .   IN THAT JUDGMENT , THE COURT RULED THAT :   . SINCE THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN SUBSTITUTED FOR THE MEMBER STATES IN RELATION TO THE FULFILMENT OF THE COMMITMENTS LAID DOWN BY THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE WITH EFFECT FROM JULY , THE DATE ON WHICH THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF WAS BROUGHT INTO FORCE , THE PROVISIONS OF THAT AGREEMENT HAVE SINCE THAT DATE BEEN AMONGST THOSE WHICH THE COURT OF JUSTICE HAS JURISDICTION , BY VIRTUE OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY , TO INTERPRET BY WAY OF A PRELIMINARY RULING REGARDLESS OF THE PURPOSE OF SUCH INTERPRETATION . WITH REGARD TO THE PERIOD PRIOR TO THAT DATE , SUCH INTERPRETATION IS A MATTER EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE COURTS OF THE MEMBER STATES .  2.THE TARIFF PROTOCOLS OF JULY AND JUNE ARE ACTS OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WITHIN THE MEANING OF SUBPARAGRAPH ( B ) OF THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY AND AS SUCH FALL WITHIN THE JURISDICTION TO GIVE PRELIMINARY RULINGS CONFERRED UPON THE COURT OF JUSTICE .      3.IN RELATION TO THE PERIOD BEFORE JULY , THE TARIFF PROTOCOLS OF JULY AND JUNE DID NOT PROTECT INDIVIDUALS AGAINST THE IMPOSITION BY A MEMBER STATE OF A CHARGE ON PRODUCTS IMPORTED FROM NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES . IN RELATION TO THE PERIOD AFTER JULY , NO PROVISION OF COMMUNITY LAW PREVENTED THE IMPOSITION ON THE SAME PRODUCTS OF A CHARGE SUCH AS THE DUTY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES PROVIDED FOR BY LAW NO OF JUNE , IN SO FAR AS IT WAS ALREADY IN EXISTENCE ON THAT DATE .   FOR THE GROUNDS OF THE RULING , REFERENCE SHOULD BE MADE TO THE JUDGMENT IN THOSE CASES , THE TEXT OF WHICH IS ANNEXED TO THIS JUDGMENT .
