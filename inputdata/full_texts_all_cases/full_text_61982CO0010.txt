A JUDGE BEFORE WHOM A REQUEST FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES IS BROUGHT , HAVING HEARD THE ARGUMENTS SET OUT BY THE PARTIES , MUST RESTRICT THE SCOPE OF HIS CONSIDERATION EXCLUSIVELY TO THE GROUNDS CAPABLE OF ESTABLISHING THE EXISTENCE OF URGENCY .   FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW IT MUST BE NOTED FIRST OF ALL THAT THE POST IN DISPUTE HAS ALREADY BEEN FILLED AND THAT , HAVING REGARD TO THE FACTS AT THE PRESENT TIME , THERE IS NO LONGER ANY REASON TO GRANT THE MEASURE REQUESTED .
