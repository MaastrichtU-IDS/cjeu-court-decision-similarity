Order of the Court (Seventh Chamber) of May – Goldman Management v Commission and Bulgaria
(Case C‑507/P)
Appeal – Article of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice – Commission’s failure to bring infringement proceedings against the Republic of Bulgaria – Bulgarian Government’s failure to act in a dispute involving internal law – Compensation for the damage supposedly sustained by reason of those failures – Appeal clearly inadmissible
Appeals – Grounds – Mere repetition of the pleas and arguments put forward before the Court of First Instance – Error of law relied on not identified – Inadmissibility (Art. TFEU; Statute of the Court of Justice, Art. 58(1); Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice,
         Art. 112(1)(c)) (see paras 11-13)
      
Re: 
Appeal brought against the judgment of the Court of First Instance (Seventh Chamber) of November in Case T‑354/Goldman Management 
v 
Commission and Bulgaria
, by which that court dismissed the action seeking, first, a declaration that the Commission had unlawfully failed to bring
                  infringement proceedings against Bulgaria and that that Member State had itself unlawfully failed to act in response to requests
                  made by the appellant in a purely internal dispute and, secondly, compensation for the damage it had allegedly sustained as
                  a result of that twofold failure to act. 
               
Operative part: 
The Court:
1.
	Dismisses the appeal; 
2.
	Orders Goldman Management Inc. to bear its own costs.
