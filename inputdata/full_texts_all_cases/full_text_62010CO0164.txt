            of bets without a licence or police authorisation — Operator excluded from the call for tenders for the award of such licences,
            in breach of Union law — Criminal penalties applied to persons linked to such an operator, acting without police authorisation —

Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling — Tribunale Amministrativo Regionale del Lazio — Freedom of movement of persons — Freedom
                  to provide services — Activity of collecting bets — Domestic legislation reserving the right to engage in the activity of
                  collecting bets to national operators who have obtained a licence — Restrictions of the opening of new betting outlets for
                  the holders of new licences — Licences lost when there is cross-border organisation of gaming similar to that considered to
                  be ‘public’– Whether compatible with Articles EC and EC.
               
Operative part 
1.
	Articles EC and EC and the principles of equal treatment and effectiveness must be interpreted as precluding a Member
                     State which, in breach of Union law, has excluded a category of operators from the award of licences for undertaking an economic
                     activity and seeks to remedy that breach by putting out to tender a significant number of new licences, from protecting the
                     market positions acquired by the pre-existing operators, by providing, inter alia, for minimum distances between the establishments
                     of new licence holders and those of pre-existing operators. 
                  
2.
	Articles EC and EC must be interpreted as precluding penalties for engaging in the organised activity of collecting
                     bets without a licence or police authorisation from being imposed on persons linked to an operator that was excluded from
                     an earlier tendering procedure, in breach of Union law, even after the new call for tenders intended to remedy that breach
                     of Union law, in so far as that call for tenders and the subsequent award of new licences have not in fact remedied the unlawful
                     exclusion of that operator from the earlier call for tenders. 
                  
3.
	It follows from Articles EC and EC, the principle of equal treatment, the obligation of transparency and the principle
                     of legal certainty that the conditions and detailed rules of a call for tenders such as that at issue in the main proceedings
                     and, in particular, the provisions concerning the withdrawal of licences granted at the end of the tendering procedure, such
                     as those laid down in Article 23(2)(a) and (3) of the model contract between the Independent Authority for the Administration
                     of State Monopolies and the successful tenderer for the licence for betting on events other than horse-races, must be drawn
                     up clearly, precisely and unambiguously, a matter which it is for the referring court to verify.
