Re:
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Korsholms tingsrätt – Interpretation of Article of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3820/of December on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport (OJ L 370, p. 1) –
                  Payments to a wage-earning driver based on distances covered
               
Operative part: 
A pay scheme based on distances covered is contrary to Article of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3820/of December on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport, unless such a scheme is of such a kind as not
         to endanger road safety. It is for the national court to ascertain, in view of all the circumstances of the case in the main
         proceedings, whether that is the case.
