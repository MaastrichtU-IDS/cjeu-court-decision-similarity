Grounds
1THE  JUDGMENT OF . . - CASE 110/PRESENT APPLICATION , WHICH WAS LODGED ON SEPTEMBER , IS PRINCIPALLY FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION OF DECEMBER APPOINTING MR L TO THE POST OF HEAD OF THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF TRANSPORT AND TRAFFIC DIVISION OF THE DIRECTORATE GENERAL FOR TRANSPORT ( DG VII ) AND IN AN ALTERNATIVE FOR THE GRANT TO THE APPLICANT OF ' ' SUCH FURTHER RELIEF AS MAY SEEM PROPER TO THE COURT ' ' .   2THE  POST IN QUESTION WAS ADVERTISED IN VACANCY NOTICE COM/643/OF OCTOBER , WHICH CONTAINED UNDER THE HEADING ' ' NATURE OF DUTIES ' ' : ' ' TO HEAD THE ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT ' '  ( AND ) . . . ' ' TO PROVIDE THE DIRECTOR GENERAL WITH TECHNICAL ADVICE . . . ' ' .   3THE QUALIFICATIONS REQUIRED WERE AS FOLLOWS :    ' ' UNIVERSITY EDUCATION , WITH DEGREE OR DIPLOMA IN CIVIL , MECHANICAL OR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING , OR EQUIVALENT PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE ; KNOWLEDGE OF INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORT ORGANIZATIONS AND OF THE COMMON TRANSPORT POLICY ; THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF TECHNICAL TRANSPORT PROBLEMS ; ABILITY TO DIRECT A LARGE ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT ; PROVEN EXPERIENCE RELEVANT TO THE POST ' ' .   4THE CANDIDATES WERE INTERVIEWED BY THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF DG VII , THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL , AND THE DIRECTOR OF DIRECTORATE C IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THEM AS REGARDS BOTH THEIR GENERAL SUITABILITY FOR THE POST AND THEIR SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE AS ENGINEERS .   5AS NONE OF THE OFFICIALS CONDUCTING THE INTERVIEW WAS A PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER A REQUEST WAS MADE TO A GROUP OF THREE ENGINEERS OF OTHER DEPARTMENTS TO DIVIDE THE APPLICATIONS INTO THREE CATEGORIES : THOSE FROM ENGINEERS WHICH WERE SUITABLE FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION , THOSE FROM ENGINEERS WHICH SHOULD NOT BE FURTHER CONSIDERED AND THOSE FROM CANDIDATES WHO WERE NOT QUALIFIED ENGINEERS AND WHICH IT THEREFORE DID NOT SEEM POSSIBLE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION .   6THIS  MULCAHY V COMMISSION  GROUP OF ENGINEERS PLACED THREE CANDIDATES ( INCLUDING THE APPLICANT ) IN THE FIRST CATEGORY BUT NOTED THAT THERE WAS A ' ' CONSIDERABLE DIVERGENCE BETWEEN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE POST OF HEAD OF DIVISION C AND THE CANDIDATES WHO HAVE BEEN PLACED IN THE FIRST CATEGORY ' ' .   7IT  WAS STATED IN A MEMORANDUM DRAWN UP BY THE DIRECTOR GENERAL ON DECEMBER THAT SEVEN CANDIDATES ( INCLUDING THE APPLICANT ) POSSESSED SOME OF THE NECESSARY ATTRIBUTES FOR THE POST WHILST THE OTHER CANDIDATES ( INCLUDING MR L ) WERE JUDGED TO BE LESS WELL QUALIFIED .   8IN THE DIRECTOR GENERAL ' S MEMORANDUM IT WAS STATED THAT NO CANDIDATE COULD BE REGARDED AS PARTICULARLY WELL QUALIFIED AND IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT THE POST BE RE-ADVERTISED AND THAT AN INTERNAL AND , IF NECESSARY , AN EXTERNAL COMPETITION SHOULD BE HELD .   9AT ITS MEETING ON DECEMBER THE COMMISSION , AFTER CONSIDERATION OF THE FILES OF THE CANDIDATES AND THE MEMORANDUM BY THE DIRECTOR GENERAL , DECIDED TO APPOINT MR L TO THE VACANT POST AND TO PROMOTE HIM TO GRADE A WITH EFFECT FROM JANUARY .    10THE CANDIDATE APPOINTED , WHO HOLDS A DEGREE IN ECONOMICS AND COMMERCE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF GENOA , COMMENCED SERVICE IN IN DG VII WHERE HE HELD VARIOUS POSTS IN THE DIVISIONS DEALING WITH GENERAL AFFAIRS , WITH INFRASTRUCTURE CHARGING WITH AIR AND SEA TRANSPORT AND , FROM JULY TO JULY , WITH TECHNICAL ASPECTS .   11IT EMERGES FROM THE STAFF REPORT FOR THE PERIOD FROM JULY TO JUNE THAT MR L ' S TRAINING AND APTITUDES WERE IN PERFECT CONFORMITY WITH THE WORK ASSIGNED TO HIM AND THAT HE VERY RAPIDLY TOOK ON THE NEW DUTIES WHICH HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO HIM IN SPITE OF THEIR VERY TECHNICAL NATURE AND THAT HE HAD SUCCESSFULLY DEPUTIZED FOR HIS HEAD OF DIVISION WHO WAS OFTEN ABSENT FOR REASONS OF HEALTH .   12ON FEBRUARY THE APPLICANT , WHO IS AN OFFICIAL IN DIVISION C OF DG VII AND HOLDS A DEGREE IN CIVIL ENGINEERING FROM THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF IRELAND , SUBMITTED A COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS FOLLOWING THE APPOINTMENT OF MR L .    13THE FAILURE OF THE COMMISSION TO REPLY TO THIS COMPLAINT CONSTITUTED , AS FROM JUNE , AN IMPLIED DECISION REJECTING IT .   14IN SUPPORT OF HIS APPLICATION THE APPLICANT MAINTAINS THAT THE COMMISSION HAS INFRINGED THE EXPRESS TERMS OF THE VACANCY NOTICE IN DISPUTE AND CONSEQUENTLY ARTICLE ( ) AND ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS , AND IN ADDITION THAT IT HAS CONTRAVENED THE PRINCIPLE ' ' ' LEGEM PATERE QUAM IPSE FECISTI ' ' .   15SINCE THE DEFENDANT HAS SPECIFIED THE QUALIFICATIONS REQUIRED FOR THE POST IN QUESTION IT IS BOUND TO APPOINT A PERSON HAVING THOSE QUALIFICATIONS .   16THE COMMISSION CONSIDERED THAT THE CANDIDATE SELECTED HAD OBTAINED PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE EQUIVALENT TO THE QUALIFICATION ACQUIRED THROUGH UNIVERSITY STUDIES AND EVIDENCED BY AN ENGINEERING DEGREE .   17THUS THE DECISIVE ISSUE IN THE PRESENT CASE IS WHAT MAY BE REGARDED AS ' ' EQUIVALENT PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE ' ' .   18WHILST AT FIRST SIGHT IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HOW A PERSON WHO HAS NEVER PRACTISED AS AN ENGINEER CAN BE HELD TO HAVE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE EQUIVALENT TO SKILLS OF UNIVERSITY LEVEL EVIDENCED BY A DEGREE IN CIVIL , MECHANICAL OR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING IT MUST NEVERTHELESS BE NOTED THAT THE POST TO BE FILLED WAS NOT SPECIFICALLY AN ENGINEERING POST BUT RATHER THAT OF HEAD OF A DIVISION AT WHICH LEVEL POINTS OF A TECHNICAL NATURE WERE HANDLED .   19MR L FIRST WORKED A NUMBER OF YEARS IN A LARGE TRANSPORT UNDERTAKING AND IN HE ENTERED THE SERVICE OF THE COMMISSION WHERE HE WAS ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF SECTORS OF THE COMMON TRANSPORT POLICY , INCLUDING SOME HIGHLY TECHNICAL ONES .   20DURING A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS ( JULY TO JUNE ), WHICH HE SPENT IN THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF TRANSPORT AND TRAFFIC DIVISION HE PERFORMED TO THE COMPLETE SATISFACTION OF THE DIRECTOR , THE DUTIES RELATING TO A POST WHICH REQUIRED TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE TO THE LEVEL OF THAT REQUIRED FOR AN ENGINEERING DEGREE AND HE FREQUENTLY DEPUTIZED FOR HIS HEAD OF DIVISION .   21THE DEFENDANT ' S APPRAISAL THAT MR L HAD PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE , WITH REGARD TO THE POST IN QUESTION , EQUIVALENT TO THE SKILLS EVIDENCED BY AN ENGINEERING DEGREE IS THUS WELL FOUNDED .   22ACCORDINGLY THE FIRST SUBMISSION CANNOT BE UPHELD .   23THE APPLICANT CLAIMS FURTHERMORE THAT ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS HAS BEEN INFRINGEND AND THAT THERE HAS BEEN MISUSE OF POWERS IN THAT THERE IS AN APPRECIABLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MERITS OF THE APPLICANT AND THOSE OF THE PERSON APPOINTED .   24CONSIDERATION OF THE COMPARATIVE MERITS OF OFFICIALS ELIGIBLE FOR PROMOTION , THE METHOD PRESCRIBED BY THE SAID ARTICLE , WAS DULY EFFECTED AT THE MEETING OF THE COMMISSION ON DECEMBER ON THE BASIS OF THE CANDIDATES '  FILES AND OF THE MEMORANDUM BY THE DIRECTOR GENERAL AFTER THE EXAMINATION UNDERTAKEN BY THE OFFICIALS WITH ENGINEERING QUALIFICATIONS .   25THIS SUBMISSION IS THUS UNFOUNDED .   26THIRDLY THE APPLICANT MAINTAINS THAT THE CANDIDATE APPOINTED DID NOT HAVE TWO YEARS '  ACTUAL SENIORITY IN HIS GRADE AT THE TIME WHEN THE VACANCY NOTICE WAS PUBLISHED .   27SINCE THE PERSON APPOINTED ONLY TOOK UP HIS DUTIES IN GRADE A ON NOVEMBER ARTICLE AND ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS HAVE , HE SUBMITS , BEEN INFRINGED .   28HOWEVER , AT THE DATE WHEN MR L WAS PROMOTED , DECEMBER , THE ONLY RELEVANT DATE WITH REGARD TO ARTICLE ( ), THE PERSON CONCERNED HAD IN FACT TWO YEARS '  SENIORITY IN GRADE A .    29THE THIRD SUBMISSION MUST ALSO BE DISMISSED .   30SINCE THE ALTERNATIVE APPLICATION IS BASED ON THE SAME SUBMISSIONS AS THE PRINCIPAL APPLICATION THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS SHOW THAT BOTH MUST BE DISMISSED AS UNFOUNDED .
