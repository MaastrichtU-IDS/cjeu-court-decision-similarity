By their appeal, Bilbaína de Alquitranes SA, Cindu Chemicals BV, Deza a.s., Industrial Química del Nalón SA, Koppers Denmark
         A/S, Koppers UK Ltd, Rütgers Germany GmbH, Rütgers Belgium NV and Rütgers Poland sp. z o.o. seek to have set aside the judgment
         of the General Court of the European Union of March in Case T‑93/Bilbaína de Alquitranes and Others v ECHA (EU:T:2013:106; ‘the judgment under appeal’), by which the General Court dismissed their application for partial annulment
         of the decision of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), published on January 2010, identifying pitch, coal tar, high temperature
         (EC No 266-028-2; ‘CTPHT’) as a substance meeting the criteria set out in Article of Regulation (EC) No 1907/of the
         European Parliament and of the Council of December concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction
         of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation
         (EEC) No 793/and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives
         91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC (OJ L 396, p. 1, and corrigendum at OJ L 136, p. 3; ‘the REACH Regulation’),
         in accordance with Article of that regulation (the ‘contested decision’).
      
 Background to the dispute and the contested decision
The appellants are suppliers of CTPHT in the European Union.
      
It is apparent from paragraph of the judgment under appeal that CTPHT is a ‘residue from the distillation of high temperature
         coal tar ... composed primarily of a complex mixture of three or more membered condensed ring aromatic hydrocarbons. This
         substance is among the substances of unknown or variable composition, complex reaction products or biological materials (“UVCB
         substances”), because it cannot be fully identified by its chemical composition. CTPHT is used mainly to produce electrode
         binders for the aluminium and steel industry. It is also used to produce refractories. Minor uses are clay targets, coating
         for corrosion protection, kerosene resistant airfield applications, road construction, roofing and briquetting’.
      
At the European Commission’s request, the ECHA prepared a dossier on the identification of CTPHT – by reference to its classification
         among the carcinogenic substances in Category of Part 3, Table 3.2, in Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/of the European
         Parliament and of the Council of December on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, amending
         and repealing Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/(OJ L 353, p. 1), and on
         account of its persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic properties (‘PBT properties’) and its very persistent and very bioaccumulative
         properties (‘vPvB properties’) – as a substance meeting the criteria set out in Article 57(a), (d) and (e) of the REACH Regulation,
         as subsequently amended by, inter alia, Regulation No 1272/2008.
      
By the contested decision, the ECHA identified CTPHT as a substance meeting the criteria set out in Article 57(a), (d) and
         (e) of the REACH Regulation, with a view to its eventual inclusion in Annex XIV to that regulation.
 The action before the General Court and the judgment under appeal
By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on February 2010, the appellants brought an action seeking partial
         annulment of the contested decision.
      
That action was based on three pleas in law. 
      
By their first plea, the appellants submitted that the ECHA had infringed the principle of equal treatment. The ECHA, they
         argued, had identified CTPHT as a substance of very high concern, without objective justification, even though other comparable
         UVCB substances containing anthracene and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were present on the market.
      
On the grounds set out in paragraphs to of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected that first plea.
      
By their second plea, the appellants submitted that the ECHA had made an error of assessment in identifying CTPHT as a PBT
         or vPvB substance on the basis of an assessment of some of its constituents with a concentration in excess of 0.1%. They submitted,
         first, that the REACH Regulation did not provide for such a possibility and, secondly, that those constituents were not formally
         identified by the ECHA as having PBT or vPvB properties. In addition, the ECHA did not comply with those criteria inasmuch
         as CTPHT contains anthracene, the only substance officially identified as a PBT substance, in concentrations of less than
         0.1%.
      
On the grounds set out in paragraphs to of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the second plea in
         its entirety.
      
By their third plea, the appellants submitted that the contested decision infringes the principle of proportionality. On the
         one hand, the decision was inappropriate in the light of the objectives pursued by the REACH Regulation, which seek to ensure
         a high level of protection of human health and the environment. On the other hand, less onerous measures would have made it
         possible to achieve those objectives.
      
On the grounds set out in paragraphs to of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the third plea.
      
 Forms of order sought
The appellants claim that the Court should: 
      
–        primarily, set aside the judgment under appeal and annul the contested decision;
–        in the alternative, refer the case back to the General Court, and 
–        order the respondent to pay the costs. 
The ECHA requests the Court to dismiss the appeal and to order the appellants to pay the costs. 
      
 The appeal
Pursuant to Article of its Rules of Procedure, where the appeal is, in whole or in part, manifestly inadmissible or manifestly
         unfounded, the Court may at any time, acting on a proposal from the Judge-Rapporteur and after hearing the Advocate General,
         decide by reasoned order to dismiss that appeal or cross-appeal in whole or in part. 
      
In support of their appeal, the appellants raise, in essence, four grounds of appeal, which may be summarised and broken down
         as follows.
      
 The first ground of appeal, relating to the scope of judicial review 
By their first ground of appeal, the appellants criticise the General Court for having, in paragraph of the judgment under
         appeal, limited the scope of its review on the sole ground that the action concerned ‘highly complex scientific and technical
         facts’. The General Court thus erred in law because the action concerned the application of clear provisions of the REACH
         Regulation. The General Court could, they submit, draw such conclusions when dealing with matters concerning the REACH Regulation,
         which raises a question of access to justice.
      
In this regard, it should be noted, as the General Court has done as a preliminary point in paragraph of the judgment under
         appeal, that, where European Union authorities have a broad discretion, in particular as to the assessment of highly complex
         scientific and technical facts in order to determine the nature and scope of the measures which they adopt, review by the
         European Union Courts must be limited to verifying whether there has been a manifest error of appraisal or a misuse of powers,
         or whether those authorities have manifestly exceeded the limits of their discretion. In such a context, the European Union
         Courts cannot substitute their assessment of scientific and technical facts for that of the institutions on which alone the
         FEU Treaty has conferred that task (Case C‑425/Enviro Tech (Europe) EU:C:2009:635, paragraph 47, and Case C‑15/Etimine EU:C:2011:504, paragraph 60).
      
Accordingly, the General Court acted correctly in law in stating, in paragraph of the judgment under appeal, that ‘the
         broad discretion of the authorities of the European Union, which implies limited judicial review of its exercise, applies
         not only to the nature and scope of the measures to be taken but also, to some extent, to the finding of the basic facts.
         However, even though such judicial review is of limited scope, it requires that the European Union institutions which have
         adopted the act in question must be able to show before the Union judicature that in adopting the act they actually exercised
         their discretion, which presupposes the taking into consideration of all the relevant factors and circumstances of the situation
         the act was intended to regulate (Case C‑343/Afton Chemical [EU:C:2010:419], paragraphs and 34)’.
      
In so ruling in accordance with the settled case-law of the Court of Justice, the General Court clearly did not breach the
         appellants’ right to access to justice, as the appellants were patently in a position to challenge the contested decision
         for the purpose of defending their interests.
      
The first ground of appeal is thus manifestly unfounded. 
      
 The second ground of appeal, alleging misinterpretation of the REACH Regulation
By their second ground of appeal, the appellants submit that the General Court committed a variety of errors in its interpretation
         of the REACH Regulation when it ruled on the identification of CTPHT and its constituents. There are two parts to this ground.
         Primarily, the appellants challenge the method by which CTPHT is identified on the basis of the properties of certain of its
         constituents. In the alternative, they argue that each of those constituents ought to have been individually identified.
      
 The first part of the second ground of appeal, relating to the identification of CTPHT on the basis of the properties of certain
         of its constituents 
      
By the first part of the second ground, the appellants criticise the grounds on the basis of which, in paragraphs to of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected their arguments relating to the approach followed by the ECHA in
         identifying CTPHT as having PBT and vPvB properties. The appellants allege that the General Court interpreted the REACH Regulation
         as not precluding the ECHA from being able to identify a substance as having PBT and vPvB properties on the basis of the properties
         of constituents having a rate of concentration in excess of 0.1%.
      
First, the appellants argue that that interpretation, in the absence of explicit provisions, goes beyond the wording of the
         REACH Regulation and Annex XIII thereto, in disregard of the principle of legal certainty. In particular, the fact that Annex
         XIII does not lay down a maximum limit of 0.1% indicates clearly, in their view, that the legislature did not wish to introduce
         such a limit in the substance identification process. That interpretation is corroborated by the fact that, during the work
         leading to the adoption of Commission Regulation (EU) No 253/of March amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/of
         the European Parliament and of the Council on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH)
         as regards Annex XIII (OJ L 69, p. 7), the legislature did not adopt the proposed amendment to Annex XIII consisting
         in the application of a single concentration threshold of 0.1%.
      
Secondly, the appellants submit that the General Court based its reasoning on false analogies or comparisons. Thus, they disagree
         with the statement, at paragraphs and of the judgment under appeal, that ‘the classification of a substance on the basis
         of the properties of its constituents appears comparable to the classification of a preparation on the basis of the properties
         of its substances’. The procedure for the classification of mixtures introduced by Regulation No 1272/is not, they argue,
         comparable to the procedure for identifying a PBT or vPvB substance, as is clear from recital of the preamble to Regulation
         No 1272/2008.
      
Even assuming that the principles of Regulation No 1272/are transferable to the situation in question, the appellants
         submit that those principles favour the method of evaluating the properties of a mixture rather than those of its constituents.
         In particular, resorting to a maximum limit of 0.1% for the classification of a mixture is possible only in the absence of
         information on the mixture itself. Consequently, the General Court’s reasoning is erroneous in so far as it would lead to
         systematic application of the limit of 0.1% without it being possible to submit scientific studies, even though Regulation
         No 1272/does not provide for a single concentration threshold, but rather for different limits between 0.1% and 1%.
      
Thirdly, the appellants dispute the assessment made by the General Court in paragraph of the judgment under appeal, according
         to which UVCB substances are multiple constituent substances. The REACH Regulation, they submit, makes a distinction between
         those two types of substances. The appellants refer in this regard to ‘ECHA Guidance for identification and naming of substances
         under REACH and [Regulation No 1272/2008]’. Accordingly, the rules of classification for a preparation cannot be applied by
         analogy.
      
Fourthly, the appellants challenge the validity of the ground on the basis of which the General Court, in paragraph of
         the judgment under appeal, held that the identification of a UVCB substance based on the properties of its constituents was
         justified by the fact that ‘once in the environment the individual constituents of such a substance will behave as independent
         substances’. The General Court thus relied on the risks arising from the use of a substance and not from its placement on
         the market. In so ruling, the General Court conflated the rules relating to the classification of a substance and those related
         to the risks posed by its use following its placement on the market.
      
Fifthly, the appellants submit that the General Court, in paragraph of the judgment under appeal, misconstrued the REACH
         Regulation in stating that Article of that regulation places substances having PBT and vPvB properties at the same level
         as substances which are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction. Regulation No 1272/sets out detailed rules
         for the classification of substances which are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction, but contains no provisions
         for PBT and vPvB substances, which are governed exclusively by Annex XIII to the REACH Regulation.
      
It should be noted that, by the first part of the second ground, the appellants raise the question of whether the General
         Court erred in law in holding that the REACH Regulation does not preclude the ECHA from being able, at the conclusion of the
         procedure provided for in Article of that regulation, to identify a substance as having PBT and vPvB properties on the
         basis of the examination of the intrinsic properties of its constituents.
      
In this regard, it should be noted that Article 59(2) and (3) of the REACH Regulation, in conjunction with Annex XV to that
         regulation, provides for the preparation of a dossier for a substance which meets the identification criteria as having PBT
         or vPvB properties, criteria which are set out in Annex XIII to that regulation. Accordingly, as was correctly pointed out
         by the General Court in paragraph of the judgment under appeal, that substance must meet the criteria which allow it to
         be regarded as having PBT or vPvB properties.
      
The notion of a ‘substance’ is defined in Article 3(1) of the REACH Regulation as ‘a chemical element and its compounds in
         the natural state or obtained by any manufacturing process, including any additive necessary to preserve its stability and
         any impurity deriving from the process used’. Thus defined, the notion of a ‘substance’ covers not only chemical elements
         with a unique molecular structure, but also those composed of several constituents, which are, as rightly noted by the General
         Court in paragraph of the judgment under appeal, an integral part of that substance.
      
Admittedly, it is true that, in the version applicable on the date of adoption of the contested decision, Annex XIII to the
         REACH Regulation did not expressly provide that a substance may be identified by taking into account the PBT or vPvB properties
         of its relevant constituents. Contrary to the appellants’ submissions, that does not, however, mean that Annex XIII to the
         REACH Regulation precluded any account from being taken of the PBT or vPvB properties of the relevant constituents of a substance.
      
As was correctly noted by the General Court in paragraph of the judgment under appeal, such an interpretation fails to
         take account of the objective of the REACH Regulation, set out in Article 1(1) thereof, which is to ensure a high level of
         protection of human health and the environment, including the promotion of alternative methods for assessment of hazards of
         substances, as well as the free circulation of substances on the internal market while enhancing competitiveness and innovation.
         Those considerations, which are related to the purpose served by the REACH Regulation, must be observed all the more strictly
         when it comes to identifying UVCB substances. Annex XIII to the REACH Regulation does not provide for specific rules relating
         to the identification of the PBT or vPvB properties of those substances the composition of which is unknown or variable and
         which contain different constituents.
      
The General Court therefore acted correctly in law in holding, in paragraph of the judgment under appeal, that ‘[a]lthough
         the wording of Annex XIII to [the REACH Regulation], in the version applicable to this case, does not expressly indicate that
         the identification of substances with PBT and vPvB properties must also take account of the PBT and vPvB properties of the
         relevant constituents of a substance, it does not preclude such an approach. However, it cannot be held that, merely because
         a constituent of a substance has a certain number of properties, the substance itself also has them, but, rather, the proportion
         in which that constituent is present and the chemical effects of such presence must be considered (see, to that effect, Case
         187/Caldana [EU:C:1985:374], paragraph 17)’.
      
Consequently, the appellants’ arguments — set out in paragraphs and of the present order and designed to show that the
         General Court erred in law in holding, in paragraph of the judgment under appeal, that ‘it cannot be concluded that the
         contested decision is vitiated by a manifest error in that the 0.1% threshold was applied as a factor entailing the identification
         of the substance at issue on the basis of its constituents’ — must be rejected as being manifestly unfounded.
      
In addition, all of the arguments set out in paragraphs to and of the present order, according to which the General
         Court’s reasoning is based on a false analogy with Regulation No 1272/or on a false interpretation of that regulation,
         are directed against grounds which, since they are intended to support the interpretation of Annex XIII to the REACH Regulation
         set out in paragraph of the judgment under appeal, are included merely for the sake of completeness. As those arguments
         cannot invalidate the judgment under appeal, they are ineffective.
      
Finally, it is clear from paragraphs to of the statement of appeal that the argument set out in paragraph of the
         present order is directed against the ground set out in paragraph of the judgment under appeal. However, that ground in
         the judgment under appeal contains a summary of the arguments put forward by the ECHA, not an assessment by the General Court.
         Consequently, that argument must be rejected. 
      
It follows from the foregoing that the first part of the second ground of appeal must be rejected as being manifestly unfounded.
         
      
 The second part of the second ground of appeal, relating to the identification of the constituents of CTPHT as having PBT
         or vPvB properties
      
By the second part of the second ground, the appellants criticise the General Court for having held, in paragraph of the
         judgment under appeal, that prior identification of the relevant constituents of CTPHT would have been of no added value compared
         with the methodology followed in this case. They argue that Article of and Annex XIII to the REACH Regulation require an
         individual assessment of each substance. Among the relevant substances constituting CTPHT, anthracene alone was subject to
         such an assessment. However, an individual and thorough evaluation of each of those constituents could have led to an outcome
         other than the identification of CTPHT, while allowing interested parties to be consulted. Therefore, they submit, the General
         Court erred in stating that individual identification of those constituents would not have brought any added value.
      
By the second part of the second ground, the appellants question, in essence, whether Article of and Annex XIII to the
         REACH Regulation require, where the identification of a UVCB substance is based on the examination of the intrinsic properties
         of certain of its constituents, that each of those constituents be the subject of an identification procedure in accordance
         with Article of the REACH Regulation.
      
As correctly noted by the General Court in paragraph of the judgment under appeal, Articles 57(d) and (e) and of the
         REACH Regulation require, for the purposes of identifying a substance, that it should meet the criteria set out in Annex XIII
         to that regulation. No provision of the REACH Regulation requires, in the case of substances composed of multiple constituents,
         that each of its constituents should be subject, individually, to an identification procedure under Article of that regulation.
         Consequently, the second part of the second ground has no legal basis. It must for that reason be rejected.
      
It follows that the second ground of appeal must be rejected as being manifestly unfounded. 
      
 The third ground of appeal, alleging failure to adjudicate and distortion of the pleadings at first instance
By their third ground of appeal, the appellants submit that the General Court did not respond to the arguments set out in
         paragraph of their reply, by which they argued that the amendments made, following the contested decision, to Annex XIII
         to the REACH Regulation by Regulation No 253/do not provide for a threshold of 0.1%. They take the view that those amendments
         rest on an approach based on the ‘weight of evidence’ or on an assessment based on expert judgment. That approach should,
         they submit, be followed in relation to PBT or vPvB substances in order for it to be possible to demonstrate that the classification
         is not warranted.
      
However, it should be noted that that argument is based on Regulation No 253/2011, which was not in force on the date of adoption
         of the contested decision. In interpreting Annex XIII to the REACH Regulation in its version applicable on that date, the
         General Court therefore manifestly did not err in law.
      
In addition, the appellants challenge the finding in paragraphs and of the judgment under appeal that they did not challenge
         ‘the application of the 0.1% threshold in general’. They point out that they made it clear that, in order to be valid, such
         a threshold had to be expressly provided for. The General Court, they submit, also failed to respond to the arguments set
         out in paragraph of the application concerning the evaluation and individual identification of each of the relevant constituents
         of CTPHT.
      
That line of argument cannot, however, in any way succeed, since it relates to arguments which were relied on in the context
         of the second ground of appeal, which has been rejected in its entirety.
      
The third ground of appeal must therefore be rejected as being manifestly unfounded. 
      
 The fourth ground of appeal, alleging infringement of the principle of equal treatment
By their fourth ground of appeal, the appellants submit that the General Court, in paragraphs to of the judgment under
         appeal, erred in law in holding that, on the one hand, the ECHA had not infringed the principle of equal treatment on the
         ground that the Commission had complied with the procedure laid down in Article of the REACH Regulation and, on the other,
         the ECHA has no power in the choice of substance to be identified. They submit that the fact that the Commission has a wide
         discretion to choose the substance to be identified as a substance of very high concern does not mean, however, that that
         institution can create, in relation to other similar substances, a situation of discrimination which is not objectively justified.
         The General Court, they argue, therefore misinterpreted the principle of equal treatment and failed to examine whether there
         was an objectively justified difference in treatment.
      
However, contrary to the appellants’ submissions, it is clear from paragraphs to of the judgment under appeal that the
         General Court conducted a detailed analysis of their line of argument alleging infringement of the principle of equal treatment.
         In order to address the first plea in law in the action, the General Court rightly held that the ECHA has no power in relation
         to the choice of substance to be identified; that prerogative belongs exclusively to the Commission and the Member States
         pursuant to Article of the REACH Regulation. From this the General Court inferred that, as the appellants had failed to
         challenge the legality of the procedure referred to in Article of the REACH Regulation, the first plea in law of the action
         had to be rejected.
      
Furthermore, it should be noted that, as part of the first ground of their appeal, the appellants alleged that the ECHA had
         infringed the principle of equal treatment by identifying CTPHT as a substance of very high concern rather than other UVCB
         substances composed of constituents containing anthracene and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. However, in the context
         of their fourth ground, the appellants rely, in support of their appeal, on a breach of equal treatment attributable to the
         Commission, which is not a party to the dispute. This therefore constitutes a new plea in law, which is manifestly inadmissible
         at the appeal stage. Consequently, the fourth ground of appeal must be rejected. 
      
In the light of all the foregoing considerations, it must be held that, as none of the grounds raised by the appellants in
         support of their appeal can be upheld, that appeal must be dismissed as being in part manifestly inadmissible and in part
         manifestly unfounded.
      
 Costs
In accordance with Article 184(2) of its Rules of Procedure, where the appeal is unfounded, the Court is to make a decision
         as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those Rules, which apply to the procedure on appeal by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof,
         the unsuccessful party must be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.
         Since the ECHA has applied for costs to be awarded against the appellants, and as the latter have been unsuccessful, the appellants
         must be ordered to pay the costs. 
      
On those grounds, the Court (Eighth Chamber) hereby:
1.      Dismisses the appeal;
2.      Orders Bilbaína de Alquitranes SA, Cindu Chemicals BV, Deza a.s., Industrial Química del Nalón SA, Koppers Denmark A/S, Koppers
            UK Ltd, Rütgers Germany GmbH, Rütgers Belgium NV and Rütgers Poland sp. z o.o. to pay the costs.
