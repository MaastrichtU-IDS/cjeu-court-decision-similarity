THE PROVISIONS CONCERNING REMUNERATION AND REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES FOR SUCH STAFF APPEAR IN CHAPTER OF THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT . ARTICLE , WHICH IS PART OF THAT CHAPTER , PROVIDED THAT ARTICLES AND OF ANNEX VII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS ARE TO APPLY TO THEM BY ANALOGY .   THE APPLICANTS THEN REGULARLY TRANSFERRED THROUGHT THE COMMISSION PART OF THEIR EMOLUMENTS IN THE CURRENCY OF THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF ANNEX VII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS .

WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLES AND , THE WEIGHTINGS FIXED PURSUANT TO THESE ARTICLES SHALL , WHENEVER THE ABOVE DATE IS CHANGED , BE ADJUSTED BY THE COUNCIL , WHICH , ACTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURE MENTIONED IN THE THIRD PARAGRAPH , SHALL CORRECT THE EFFECT OF THE VARIATION IN THE BELGIAN FRANC WITH RESPECT TO THE RATES REFERRED TO IN THE SECOND PARAGRAPH .

' '    ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 3085/PROVIDES THAT IT IS TO ENTER INTO FORCE ON JANUARY AND IS TO APPLY AS FROM APRIL .    ON DECEMBER , THE COUNCIL ALSO ADOPTED REGULATION ( EURATOM , ECSC , EEC ) NO 3086/ADJUSTING THE WEIGHTINGS APPLICABLE TO THE REMUNERATION AND PENSIONS OF OFFICIALS AND OTHER SERVANTS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES FOLLOWING THE AMENDMENT OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS CONCERNING THE MONETARY PARITIES TO BE USED IN IMPLEMENTING THE STAFF REGULATIONS . ARTICLE ( ) OF THE REGULATION FIXES , INTER ALIA , THE WEIGHTING APPLICABLE TO THE REMUNERATION AS 98.FOR THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY AND 62.FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM .       AS A RESULT OF THE NEW RULES , THE RATE OF EXCHANGE FOR THE GERMAN MARK AGAINST THE POUND STERLING CHANGED FROM UKL = DM 10.TO UKL = DM 6.AND CONSEQUENTLY THE APPLICATION OF THOSE RULES ENTAILED , ACCORDING TO THE APPLICANTS , A SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE IN THEIR EFFECTIVE SALARY , THE AMOUNT TRANSFERRED IN GERMAN MARKS REMAINING THE SAME BUT THE BALANCE PAID IN POUNDS STERLING BEING DECREASED .   PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT , THE PROVISIONS OF TITLE VII ( NAMELY ARTICLES AND ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS CONCERNING APPEALS ARE APPLICABLE BY ANALOGY TO THE APPLICANTS .   BY A LETTER OF MARCH , THE APPLICANTS AND OTHER SCIENTISTS EMPLOYED AS SERVANTS WITH JET SENT A COLLECTIVE REQUEST TO THE JET COUNCIL ASKING IT TO SET UP AN INTERIM SYSTEM WHICH WOULD AVOID ANY REDUCTION IN THEIR EFFECTIVE SALARY .   IN LETTERS SENT BY THEM SEPARATELY ON MARCH THE APPLICANTS ASKED THAT THE RULES IN ISSUE SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO THEM OR THAT THE COMMISSION SHOULD APPLY COMPENSATORY INTERIM MEASURES IN THEIR CASE .   BY LETTER OF JULY , THE COMMISSION REPLIED ON THE ONE HAND THAT IT COULD NOT , WITHOUT EXCEEDING ITS POWERS , REFRAIN FROM APPLYING COUNCIL REGULATIONS WHICH HAD DULY ENTERED INTO FORCE AND ON THE OTHER HAND THAT IT APPROVED IN SUBSTANCE THE AMENDMENTS WHICH HAD BEEN MADE TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   THE APPLICANTS THEN BROUGHT THEIR ACTIONS AGAINST BOTH THE COUNCIL AND THE COMMISSION . THEY ASK THAT THE COURT DECLARE THAT THEIR EMPLOYER ' S DECISION WHEREBY THE CONVERSION RATE FOR THE TRANSFERABLE PORTION OF THEIR REMUNERATION IS FIXED AT UKL = DM 6.IS VOID , OR ELSE THAT IT IS NOT APPLICABLE TO THEM ; TO DECLARE THAT , ON THE CONTRARY , THE RATE OF EXCHANGE FOR THAT TRANSFERABLE PORTION IS THE ONE FIXED BY CONTRACT BETWEEN THE PARTIES NAMELY UKL = DM 10.AND TO ORDER THE COMMISSION TO REIMBURSE THEM FOR THE LOSS OF SALARY SUFFERED BY THEM AS A RESULT OF THE RULES IN ISSUE .       THE APPLICANTS RELY ON TWO GROUNDS . THE FIRST IS THE INFRINGEMENT OF ACQUIRED RIGHTS . ACCORDING TO THE APPLICANTS , THE CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO TEMPORARY SERVANTS ARE BASED ON THEIR CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT . THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE APPLICANTS ARE THEREFORE DERIVED IN THE FIRST PLACE FROM THEIR CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT AND NOT FROM THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT . THE TERMS OF REMUNERATION WERE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE SUBJECT OF A SPECIAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES . THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THAT REMUNERATION WERE SET OUT IN THE OFFERS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OCTOBER ( OBERT ) AND NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER ( VENUS ). THOSE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS COULD NOT BE UNILATERALLY CHANGED BY THE RULES IN ISSUE AND THE EMPLOYER THEREFORE INFRINGED THE RIGHTS WHICH THE APPLICANTS HAD VALIDLY ACQUIRED BY CONTRACT .   THE SECOND GROUND IS BREACH OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION WHICH EVERY OFFICIAL MAY HAVE WITH REGARD TO THE CONDUCT OF THE AUTHORITY EMPLOYING HIM . BOTH APPLICANTS LEFT THEIR EMPLOYMENT , AND DR VENUS ALSO LEFT HIS FAMILY , TO TAKE UP THE POSTS OFFERED BY THE COMMISSION ON THE FAITH OF THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS , CONTAINING DETAILED FIGURES , WHICH HAD BEEN MADE TO THEM DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS WHICH PRECEDED THEIR ENGAGEMENT ; THE POSSIBILITY OF TRANSFERRING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THEIR REMUNERATION AT THE RATES SPECIFIED IN THE OFFERS OF EMPLOYMENT TO THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN WHERE THEY WOULD STILL HAVE MAJOR FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS WAS A DECIDING FACTOR IN THEIR ENTERING INTO THE CONTRACTS AND SHOULD THEREFORE BE REGARDED AS AN ESSENTIAL ASPECT OF THEIR APPOINTMENT . IT WOULD BE CONTRARY TO THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY THAT THE APPLICANTS SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO A RADICAL CHANGE IN THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES BROUGHT ABOUT BY INTERFERENCE WITH FUNDAMENTAL CONDITIONS OF SUCH A NATURE AS TO INDUCE THEM TO ACCEPT THEIR POSTS .  ADMISSIBILITY   BY WRITTEN SUBMISSION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JANUARY THE COUNCIL RAISED AN OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COURT . NEITHER THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF THE APPLICATIONS NOR THE CONCLUSIONS CONTAINED IN THEM CALLED IN QUESTION ANY MEASURE TAKEN BY THE COUNCIL . THE COUNCIL IS NOT THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY AS FAR AS THE APPLICANTS ARE CONCERNED . MOREOVER , THE APPLICANTS NEVER SENT THE COUNCIL A COMPLAINT WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS . AS REGARDS THE REQUEST THAT THE COMMISSION BE ORDERED TO REIMBURSE THEM FOR THEIR LOSS OF SALARY IN CONSEQUENCE OF AND FROM THE TIME OF APPLICATION OF THE RULES IN ISSUE , APART FROM THE FACT THAT THAT REQUEST REFERS EXPRESSLY TO THE COMMISSION , THE APPLICANTS '  ACTION IN RESPECT OF NON-CON    TRACTUAL LIABILITY IS ALSO INADMISSIBLE . THE DAMAGE ALLEGEDLY SUFFERED BY THE APPLICANTS IS TO BE REGARDED AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE APPLICATION OF THE DECISION IN RESPECT OF WHICH A DECLARATION OF NULLITY IS SOUGHT AND , IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES , THE ACTION TO ESTABLISH LIABILITY IS MERGED WITH THE ACTION FOR ANNULMENT .   IN REPLY TO THE COUNCIL THE APPLICANTS STATE THAT IT IS NOT THEIR INTENTION TO BRING AN ACTION SPECIFICALLY AGAINST ONE OF ITS MEASURES BUT ADD THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY SHOULD INDIRECTLY INVOLVE THE COUNCIL IN THE PROCEEDINGS SINCE THE RULES IN ISSUE ORIGINATED FROM IT . THEY STATE THAT THEY DO NOT SEEK AND HAVE NEVER SOUGHT TO BRING AN ACTION TO ESTABLISH NON-CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY UNDER ARTICLE OF THE TREATY , AGAINST EITHER THE COUNCIL OR THE COMMISSION .   THE OBJECTIONS MUST BE UPHELD . UNDER ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS THE COMPLAINT , AND CONSEQUENTLY THE APPLICATION , MAY BE DIRECTED ONLY AGAINST THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY AND THE ACT HAVING AN ADVERSE AFFECT MUST HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY THAT AUTHORITY .   IN ITS DEFENCE , THE COMMISSION ALSO CONTENDS THAT THE APPLICATION IS INADMISSIBLE . IT ENVISAGES THREE POSSIBILITIES REGARDING THE REQUEST FOR ANNULMENT OF THE ' ' EMPLOYER ' S DECISION WHEREBY THE CONVERSION RATE FOR THE TRANSFERABLE PART OF THEIR REMUNERATION IS FIXED AT UKL = 6.DM ' ' . IF THE APPLICATIONS SEEK ANNULMENT OF REGULATIONS NOS 3085/AND 3086/THEY DO NOT REFER TO A MEASURE BY THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY AND ARE THEREBY INADMISSIBLE . IF THE APPLICATIONS SEEK ANNULMENT OF THE CIRCULAR OF APRIL , ISSUED BY THE JET ADMINISTRATION , THE APPLICATIONS ARE LIKEWISE INADMISSIBLE , IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE THAT CIRCULAR IS MERELY A DOCUMENT WHICH EXPLAINS THE CONTENT AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE NEW PROVISIONS OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND CANNOT THEREFORE CONSTITUTE A MEASURE HAVING AN ADVERSE AFFECT WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS : IN ADDITION , BECAUSE THE APPLICANTS DID NOT LODGE ANY COMPLAINT REGARDING THE CIRCULAR . FINALLY , IF , AS POSTULATED AS THE THIRD POSSIBILITY , THE APPLICATIONS SEEK ANNULMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS REGARDING CALCULATION OF THE REMUNERATION IN RESPECT OF APRIL , THEY ARE LIKEWISE INADMISSIBLE BECAUSE THE CALCULATION OF THE APPLICANT ' S REMUNERATION FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL WAS NOT THE SUBJECT OF ANY COMPLAINT AT ALL ON THEIR PART . INADMISSIBILITY OF THE CLAIM FOR ANNULMENT INVOLVES INADMISSIBILITY OF THE CLAIM FOR COMPENSATION LINKED WITH THE FIRST MENTIONED CLAIM .       IN REPLY THE APPLICANTS STATE THAT THE COMMISSION MAY NOT , WITHOUT CONTRADICTING ITSELF , REPROACH THE APPLICANTS FOR NOT LODGING A PRIOR COMPLAINT THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS AGAINST A DECISION WHICH , ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSION , MAY NOT BE ANNULLED OR AMENDED . THE MATTER IN ISSUE WAS PROPERLY SUBMITTED TO THE COMMISSION BY THE COMPLAINTS THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS OF AND MARCH AND CONSEQUENTLY THE APPLICATIONS , IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE DIRECTED AGAINST THE EMPLOYER ' S DECISION TO CALCULATE THEIR REMUNERATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULES IN ISSUE , ARE ADMISSIBLE AND ACCORDINGLY THEIR ACTION SEEKING COMPENSATION FOR THE DAMAGE SUFFERED BY THEM IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT DECISION IS ALSO ADMISSIBLE .   THE ACTION IS ALSO INADMISSIBLE IN SO FAR AS IT IS DIRECTED AGAINST THE COMMISSION . THE APPLICANTS '  COMPLAINTS DATE FROM MARCH . ONLY ON APRIL , WHEN PREPARING THE PAY SLIP FOR APRIL , DID THE COMMISSION APPLY THE NEW REGULATIONS AND THUS ADOPT THE FIRST MEASURE LIABLE ADVERSELY TO AFFECT THE APPLICANTS IN THE MANNER PROVIDED FOR IN THE STAFF REGULATIONS . THE COMPLAINTS WERE THEREFORE PREMATURE . AFTER RECEIPT OF THEIR PAY SLIPS FOR APRIL THE APPLICANTS DID NOT AT ANY TIME LODGE COMPLAINTS AGAINST THAT MEASURE PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS . IF THE COMPLAINTS OF AND MARCH ARE TO BE REGARDED AS REQUESTS AS PROVIDED FOR BY ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , INVITING THE COMMISSION TO ADOPT A DECISION WITH RESPECT TO THEM , THE APPLICANTS DID NOT LODGE COMPLAINTS AS PROVIDED FOR BY ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AGAINST THE COMMISSION ' S REFUSAL TO TAKE SUCH A DECISION , REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THAT REFUSAL WAS CONSTITUTED BY THE CIRCULAR LETTER OF APRIL OR BY THE LETTER OF JULY . IN THE ABSENCE OF A COMPLAINT DULY LODGED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , FOLLOWING A MEASURE HAVING AN ADVERSE EFFECT , THE APPLICATIONS ARE INADMISSIBLE .   IT IS REGRETTABLE THAT THE COMMISSION SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THE APPLICANTS , IN THE OFFERS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OCTOBER AND DECEMBER , SPECIFIC DETAILS AS TO THE EXCHANGE RATES APPLICABLE TO THE TRANSFERS , KNOWING AS IT DID THAT THOSE RATES WOULD BE CONSIDERABLY AFFECTED BY THE REGULATIONS WHICH , AT THE TIME THE OFFERS OF EMPLOYMENT WERE MADE , IT WAS INSISTENTLY ASKING THE COUNCIL TO ADOPT BEFORE THE END OF . HOWEVER , THAT FACT HAS NO EFFECT ON THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATIONS .   HAVING REGARD TO THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS , THE APPLICATIONS MUST BE DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .   HOWEVER , SINCE THE TERMS OF THE COMMISSION ' S OFFERS OF EMPLOYMENT WERE A FACTOR IN THE APPLICANTS '  DECISION TO BRING THEIR APPLICATIONS THE COMMISSION IS ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS OF THE PROCEEDINGS .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ( FIRST CHAMBER )   . DISMISSES THE APPLICATIONS AS INADMISSIBLE .  . ORDERS THE COMMISSION TO PAY TO COSTS OF THE PROCEEDINGS .
