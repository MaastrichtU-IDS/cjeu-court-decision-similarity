Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT BY NOT IMPLEMENTING WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 75/440/EEC OF JUNE CONCERNING THE QUALITY REQUIRED OF SURFACE WATER INTENDED FOR THE ABSTRACTION OF DRINKING WATER IN THE MEMBER STATES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L OF JULY , P . ), THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON APRIL THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR A DECLARATION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY THAT BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NEEDED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 75/440/EEC OF JUNE CONCERNING THE QUALITY REQUIRED OF SURFACE WATER INTENDED FOR THE ABSTRACTION OF DRINKING WATER IN THE MEMBER STATES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ), THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE THIRD PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .   ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE PROVIDES THAT MEMBER STATES ARE TO BRING INTO FORCE THE MEASURES NEEDED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE DIRECTIVE WITHIN TWO YEARS OF NOTIFICATION THEREOF . THAT PERIOD EXPIRED , IN THIS CASE , ON JUNE .    THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DENY THAT IT HAS NOT FULFILLED THAT OBLIGATION . ALTHOUGH THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT ASKED THE COURT ' ' TO TAKE NOTE THAT THE DIRECTIVE IN QUESTION HAS ALREADY BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MEASURES IMPLEMENTING IT IN PART ' ' , IT IS CLEAR FROM THE PARTICULARS SUBSEQUENTLY GIVEN BY THAT GOVERNMENT THAT THE MEASURES WHICH IT HAS ADOPTED ARE NOT DESIGNED TO IMPLEMENT COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 75/.    ESSENTIALLY , THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT JUSTIFIES ITS FAILURE BY THE FACT THAT IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS CONCERNING REDISTRIBUTION OF POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES BETWEEN NATIONAL AND REGIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE IN PROGRESS , ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA COVERED BY THE DIRECTIVE IN QUESTION . SO LONG AS THE NEW INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT YET IN A POSITION TO EXERCISE THEIR POWERS IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE , ACCORDING TO THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT , TO IMPLEMENT THE DIRECTIVE .   ALTHOUGH THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY EXPLAIN THE DIFFICULTY IN APPLYING THE DIRECTIVE THEY DO NOT EXPUNGE THE FAILURE OF THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS . ACCORDING TO ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW OF THE COURT A MEMBER STATE MAY NOT PLEAD PROVISIONS , PRACTICES OR CIRCUMSTANCES IN ITS INTERNAL LEGAL     SYSTEM TO JUSTIFY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OBLIGATIONS UNDER COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES .   IT SHOULD BE POINTED OUT THAT , IN ORDER THAT THE EXCEPTIONAL SITUATION REFERRED TO BY HIS GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT , THE BELGIAN MINISTER FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT , IN ANSWER TO THE REASONED OPINION PROVIDED FOR IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY , REQUESTED THE COMMISSION ON NOVEMBER TO GRANT THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM AN ADDITIONAL PERIOD OF ONE YEAR TO ADOPT THE MEASURES OF NATIONAL LAW NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT THE DIRECTIVE . THESE MEASURES OUGHT TO HAVE ENTERED INTO FORCE IN JUNE , AND IN FACT IT WAS ONLY ON APRIL THAT THE COMMISSION BROUGHT THE MATTER BEFORE THE COURT UNDER THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .   IT MUST THEREFORE BE HELD THAT BY NOT ADOPTING WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 75/440/EEC OF JUNE , THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE PROVIDES THAT THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY SHALL BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS IF THEY HAVE BEEN ASKED FOR . SINCE THE DEFENDANT HAS BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL , IT MUST BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .
