                  Mortgage loan contract concluded between a financial establishment and a public body — Legislative amendment declaring non-transferable

Operative part 
The Court of Justice of the European Union clearly has no jurisdiction to answer the questions referred by the Gyulai Törvényszék
         (Hungary), by decision of January 2012.
