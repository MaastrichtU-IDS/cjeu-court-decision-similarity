Grounds
BY A LETTER RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON SEPTEMBER 1987, THE COMMISSION INFORMED THE COURT THAT IT WAS DISCONTINUING ITS ACTION, AND, PURSUANT TO THE FIRST SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE 69*() OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, REQUESTED THAT THE HELLENIC REPUBLIC BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .  BY A LETTER RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON OCTOBER 1987, THE HELLENIC REPUBLIC ACKNOWLEDGED THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THE ACTION AND REQUESTED THE COURT TO ORDER THE PARTIES TO BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .  IN ITS FURTHER OBSERVATIONS, LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON OCTOBER 1987, THE COMMISSION POINTS OUT THAT THE DISCONTINUANCE OF ITS ACTION WAS DUE NOT MERELY TO THE AMENDMENT OF ARTICLE OF GREEK REGULATION NO 72/ON THE CONTROL OF MARKETS, BUT TO THE REVISION OF ALL GREEK LEGISLATION TO COMPLY WITH DIRECTIVE 71/307/EEC; THAT IS WHY THE COMMISSION SEEKS THE APPLICATION OF THE FIRST SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE 69*() OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE .  ACCORDING TO THE FIRST SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE 69*() OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, A PARTY WHO DISCONTINUES OR WITHDRAWS FROM PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS, UNLESS THE DISCONTINUANCE OR WITHDRAWAL IS JUSTIFIED BY THE CONDUCT OF THE OPPOSITE PARTY .  IT MUST BE HELD IN THIS INSTANCE THAT THE COMMISSION' S DISCONTINUANCE OF ITS ACTION IS JUSTIFIED BY THE CONDUCT OF THE HELLENIC REPUBLIC, WHICH DID NOT ADOPT UNTIL AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF PROCEEDINGS BY THE COMMISSION THE MEASURES NEEDED FOR COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY AND THE PROVISIONS OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 71/307/EEC OF JULY ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO TEXTILE NAMES .  THE HELLENIC REPUBLIC SHOULD THEREFORE BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .
