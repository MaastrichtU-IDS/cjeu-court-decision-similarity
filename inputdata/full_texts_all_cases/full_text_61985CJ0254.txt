IN CASE 254/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE SUPREME COURT OF IRELAND FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE PROCEEDINGS PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  IRISH GRAIN BOARD ( TRADING ) LIMITED ( IN LIQUIDATION )   AND  THE MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE  
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION IN PARTICULAR OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 974/OF THE COUNCIL OF MAY ON CERTAIN MEASURES OF CONJUNCTURAL POLICY TO BE TAKEN IN AGRICULTURE FOLLOWING THE TEMPORARY WIDENING OF THE MARGINS OF FLUCTUATION FOR THE CURRENCIES OF CERTAIN MEMBER STATES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ) AND OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1380/OF THE COMMISSION OF MAY LAYING DOWN DETAILED RULES FOR THE APPLICATION OF MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) WITH A VIEW TO DETERMINING WHETHER THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS IS ENTITLED TO PAYMENT OF MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS ON IMPORTS INTO THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GRAIN WHOSE ACTUAL RELEASE INTO THE UNITED KINGDOM ECONOMY HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED , AND , IF SO , UNDER WHICH CONDITIONS , 
Grounds
BY ORDER OF JUNE , WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON AUGUST , THE SUPREME COURT OF IRELAND REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOUR QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE INTERPRETATION IN PARTICULAR OF REGULATION NO 974/OF THE COUNCIL OF MAY ON CERTAIN MEASURES OF CONJUNCTURAL POLICY TO BE TAKEN IN AGRICULTURE FOLLOWING THE TEMPORARY WIDENING OF THE MARGINS OF FLUCTUATION FOR THE CURRENCIES OF CERTAIN MEMBER STATES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ) AND OF REGULATION NO 1380/OF THE COMMISSION OF MAY LAYING DOWN DETAILED RULES FOR THE APPLICATION OF MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), WITH A VIEW TO DETERMINING WHETHER THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS IS ENTITLED TO PAYMENT OF MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS ON IMPORTS INTO THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GRAIN WHOSE ACTUAL RELEASE INTO THE UNITED KINGDOM ECONOMY HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED , AND , IF SO , UNDER WHICH CONDITIONS .  THOSE QUESTIONS AROSE IN A DISPUTE BETWEEN IRISH GRAIN BOARD ( TRADING ) LIMITED ( IN LIQUIDATION ), THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS , AND THE MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE , ACTING AS THE IRISH INTERVENTION AGENCY , CONCERNING GRAIN WHICH THE PLAINTIFF SOLD TO FIVE PURCHASERS IN NORTHERN IRELAND .  THE DOCUMENTS BEFORE THE COURT SHOW THAT THE CONSIGNMENTS IN QUESTION WERE TRANSPORTED FROM IRELAND TO NORTHERN IRELAND BY CARRIERS ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE PURCHASERS , WHILST THE DOCUMENTATION SUBMITTED TO THE INTERVENTION AGENCY FOR THE PAYMENT OF MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS WAS PREPARED BY THE PLAINTIFF . THE DOCUMENTATION INCLUDED , IN PARTICULAR , T CONTROL COPIES WHICH STATED THAT THE GRAIN WAS ' INTENDED FOR HOME USE IN NORTHERN IRELAND ' .  ACCORDING TO AN AGREEMENT CONCLUDED BETWEEN IRELAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM UNDER ARTICLE A OF REGULATION NO 974/, IT WAS FOR THE IRISH INTERVENTION AGENCY TO PAY THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS WHICH WERE TO BE GRANTED BY THE UNITED KINGDOM ON IMPORTATION INTO THAT COUNTRY . SINCE THE INTERVENTION AGENCY HAD SERIOUS GROUNDS FOR SUSPECTING THAT THE GRAIN HAD BEEN CLANDESTINELY RE-IMPORTED INTO IRELAND FOR RE-EXPORTATION TO THE UNITED KINGDOM , IT REQUESTED THE NORTHERN IRISH CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES TO CARRY OUT AN INVESTIGATION ON ITS BEHALF . SINCE THOSE AUTHORITIES WERE UNABLE TO SATISFY THEMSELVES THAT THE GRAIN HAD IN FACT ENTERED NORTHERN IRELAND FOR HOME USE WITHIN THAT TERRITORY , THE INTERVENTION AGENCY REFUSED TO PAY THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS CLAIMED .  THE PLAINTIFF BROUGHT AN ACTION TO RECOVER THOSE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS FROM THE INTERVENTION AGENCY BEFORE THE HIGH COURT OF IRELAND . THAT COURT HELD THAT THE NORTHERN IRISH PURCHASERS , OR AT LEAST SOME OF THEM , WERE GUILTY OF FRAUDULENT CAROUSEL TRADING AND OF IRREGULARITIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE GRAIN SOLD AND EXPORTED BY THE PLAINTIFF . THE HIGH COURT HELD , HOWEVER , THAT THE PLAINTIFF WAS IN NO WAY GUILTY OF OR PRIVY TO THOSE IRREGULARITIES AND HAD NOT FORFEITED ITS ENTITLEMENT TO THE PAYMENT OF MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS BY REASON OF THE MISCONDUCT OF THE PURCHASERS OVER WHOM IT HAD NO CONTROL .  THE INTERVENTION AGENCY APPEALED AGAINST THAT DECISION TO THE SUPREME COURT OF IRELAND WHICH REFERRED THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING :    ( ) IN A CASE WHERE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS ARE PAYABLE BY IT IN RESPECT OF COMMODITIES EXPORTED TO ANOTHER MEMBER STATE PURSUANT TO THE RELEVANT COMMUNITY REGULATIONS AND COMMUNITY LAW GOVERNING THE PAYMENT OF SUCH MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS ( IN PARTICULAR ARTICLES TO OF THE EEC TREATY , REGULATION NO 974/, AS AMENDED , REGULATION NO 1380/, AS AMENDED , AND REGULATION NO 3094/) IS A MEMBER STATE ENTITLED TO REFUSE PAYMENT WHEN THE COMMODITIES CONCERNED HAVE NOT BEEN RELEASED INTO THE ECONOMY OF THE IMPORTING MEMBER STATE DUE TO FRAUD OR OTHER IRREGULARITY ON THE PART OF THE PURCHASERS OF THE SAID COMMODITIES , NOTWITHSTANDING THAT CUSTOMS FORMALITIES WERE COMPLETED , APPROPRIATE T FORMS ISSUED AND THE ' EXPORTER '  OR ' PERSON CONCERNED ' , WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SAID REGULATIONS , AT ALL TIMES ACTED BONA FIDE IN RELATION TO THE SAID TRANSACTION?    ( ) IS A MEMBER STATE ENTITLED TO REFUSE PAYMENT OF MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS CLAIMED IN RESPECT OF COMMODITIES EXPORTED TO ANOTHER MEMBER STATE UNLESS AND UNTIL THE CLAIMANT DISCHARGES AN ONUS OF ESTABLISHING THAT SUCH TRANSACTIONS WERE ACTUALLY CARRIED OUT AND EXECUTED CORRECTLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMMUNITY REGULATIONS AND LAW , AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE PRODUCTION OF THE APPROPRIATE T FORMS OR THE BONA FIDES OF THE ACTUAL CLAIMANT?    ( ) WHERE THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY LIABLE TO PAY MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS HAS NOT PAID THEM WITHIN TWO MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF RECEIPT OF SUFFICIENT SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION BY REASON OF HAVING SET IN TRAIN ADMINISTRATIVE INQUIRIES OWING TO THE DOUBTS CONCERNING THE SAID DOCUMENTATION , IS ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1380/TO BE INTERPRETED AS REQUIRING THE SAID COMPETENT AUTHORITY TO PAY INTEREST ON THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS AND , IF SO , FROM WHAT DATE AND AT WHAT RATE?    ( ) WHERE A MEMBER STATE IS OBLIGED TO CHARGE A LEVY ON EXPORTS UNDER REGULATION NO 974/, AS AMENDED , AND BY AGREEMENT WITH ANOTHER MEMBER STATE UNDER ARTICLE A OF THE SAID REGULATION NO 974/IS PAYING THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS GRANTED ON IMPORTS BY THAT IMPORTING MEMBER STATE AND WHICH EXCEED THE LEVY SO THAT THE AMOUNT PAID TO THE PERSON CONCERNED IS THE EXCESS OF THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNT OVER THE LEVY , ARE ARTICLE A OF REGULATION NO 974/AND ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1380/TO BE INTER PRETED AS ENTITLING THE PERSON CONCERNED TO BE PAID IN THE CURRENCY OF THE IMPORTING MEMBER STATE GRANTING THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNT?   FOR THE OBSERVATIONS SUBMITTED TO THE COURT REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING .  FIRST QUESTION  ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1380/PROVIDES THAT PAYMENT BY THE EXPORTING MEMBER STATE OF THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNT WHICH SHOULD BE GRANTED BY THE IMPORTING MEMBER STATE IS TO BE CONDITIONAL UPON THE PRODUCTION OF PROOF THAT CUSTOMS IMPORT FORMALITIES HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND THAT THE DUTIES AND CHARGES HAVING EQUIVALENT EFFECT PAYABLE IN THE IMPORTING MEMBER STATE HAVE BEEN CHARGED . THAT PROVISION ALSO STATES THAT SUCH PROOF IS TO BE FURNISHED BY PRODUCTION OF THE T CONTROL COPY WHICH MUST SPECIFY THAT THE PRODUCT IN QUESTION IS ' INTENDED FOR ENTRY FOR HOME USE '  IN THE IMPORTING MEMBER STATE .  ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF THAT REGULATION , PAYMENT OF THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS MUST BE MADE WITHIN TWO MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF DEPOSIT OF SUFFICIENT SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS EXCEPT , INTER ALIA , WHERE ADMINISTRATIVE INQUIRIES HAVE BEEN COMMENCED OWING TO DOUBTS CONCERNING THE ACCURACY OF THE EVIDENCE PRODUCED .  THOSE PROVISIONS MUST BE INTERPRETED IN THE LIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF THE SYSTEM OF MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS WHICH IS TO COUNTERACT THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH MIGHT ARISE FOR THE PROPER WORKING OF THE COMMON ORGANIZATIONS OF THE MARKET AS A RESULT OF CURRENCY INSTABILITY AND - AS MATTERS NOW STAND - DIVERGENCES BETWEEN THE REPRESENTATIVE RATES USED IN THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY AND THE CONVERSION RATES ON THE MARKET . IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT PURPOSE , THE FUNCTION OF MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS IS TO COMPENSATE FOR ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO RATES BOTH IN THE IMPORTING MEMBER STATE AND IN THE EXPORTING MEMBER STATE AND THUS TO CORRECT THE DIVERGENCE BETWEEN PRICE LEVELS IN NATIONAL CURRENCY IN THOSE TWO MEMBER STATES .  IT FOLLOWS THAT THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNT GRANTED ON IMPORTATION CANNOT FULFIL ITS FUNCTION UNLESS THE IMPORTED PRODUCT ACTUALLY ENTERS THE IMPORTING MEMBER STATE FOR HOME USE AND IS THUS SUBJECTED TO THE PRICE CONDITIONS PREVAILING ON THE MARKET IN THAT COUNTRY . IF , HOWEVER , THE PRODUCT IS DIVERTED BY FRAUDULENT MEANS FROM ITS INTENDED PURPOSE AS SPECIFIED ON THE T CONTROL COPY AND IS CLANDESTINELY RE-EXPORTED , THAT IS TO SAY WITHOUT PAYMENT OF THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNT WHICH IS PAYABLE BY VIRTUE OF THE LATTER OPERATION AND WHICH WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF CANCELLING OUT THE BENEFIT OF THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNT GRANTED ON IMPORTATION , THAT AMOUNT LOSES ITS JUSTIFICATION .  IT IS OF NO IMPORTANCE IN THAT REGARD THAT THE FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES WERE CARRIED ON BY THE IMPORTER SINCE UNDER AN AGREEMENT CONCLUDED PURSUANT TO ARTICLE A OF REGULATION NO 974/THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNT ON IMPORTS MUST BE PAID NOT BY THE IMPORTING MEMBER STATE BUT BY THE EXPORTING MEMBER STATE FOR THE BENEFIT OF EXPORTERS ACTING IN GOOD FAITH . IT SHOULD BE ADDED THAT IT IS OPEN TO THE EXPORTER TO ENSURE BY CONTRACTUAL MEANS THAT PURCHASERS DO NOT FRAUDULENTLY DIVERT THE PRODUCT FROM THE INTENDED PURPOSE SPECIFIED BY THE EXPORTER HIMSELF ON THE T CONTROL COPY .  THE ANSWER TO THE FIRST QUESTION SUBMITTED TO THE COURT MUST THEREFORE BE THAT THE PROVISIONS OF COMMUNITY LAW GOVERNING THE PAYMENT OF MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS , IN PARTICULAR ARTICLES AND OF REGULATION NO 1380/, MUST BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT THE EXPORTING MEMBER STATE WHICH HAS TO PAY THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS THAT MUST BE GRANTED BY THE IMPORTING MEMBER STATE IS ENTITLED TO REFUSE PAYMENT WHERE THE PRODUCT IN QUESTION HAS NOT ENTERED THE IMPORTING MEMBER STATE FOR HOME USE OWING TO FRAUD ON THE PART OF THE PURCHASERS OF THE SAID PRODUCT , EVEN WHERE THE CUSTOMS FORMALITIES HAVE BEEN COMPLETED , APPROPRIATE T FORMS HAVE BEEN ISSUED AND THE ' EXPORTER '  OR ' PERSON CONCERNED '  WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE REGULATIONS IN QUESTION AT ALL TIMES ACTED IN GOOD FAITH IN RELATION TO THE SAID TRANSACTION .  SECOND QUESTION  IN ITS SECOND QUESTION THE SUPREME COURT ASKS ESSENTIALLY WHETHER , NOTWITHSTANDING THE SUBMISSION OF THE APPROPRIATE T CONTROL COPIES , THE EXPORTING MEMBER STATE IS ENTITLED TO REFUSE TO PAY TO AN EXPORTER ACTING IN GOOD FAITH THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNT WHICH MUST BE GRANTED ON IMPORTATION INTO ANOTHER MEMBER STATE UNLESS AND UNTIL THE EXPORTER FURNISHES PROOF THAT THE PRODUCT IN QUESTION HAS ACTUALLY ENTERED THE IMPORTING MEMBER STATE FOR HOME USE .  IN THAT REGARD IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT , ALTHOUGH THE RULES OF COMMUNITY LAW DO NOT CONTAIN ANY PROVISION EXPRESSLY REQUIRING FORMAL PROOF OF THAT KIND , ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1380/PROVIDES , AS STATED ABOVE , FOR AN EXCEPTION TO THE GENERAL RULE AS TO THE TIME ALLOWED FOR PAYMENT IN CASES WHERE ADMINISTRATIVE INQUIRIES HAVE BEEN COMMENCED OWING TO DOUBTS CONCERNING THE ACCURACY OF THE EVIDENCE PRODUCED .  IT MUST BE EMPHASIZED IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT IT IS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONDUCT THAT INQUIRY WITH THE GREATEST POSSIBLE DILIGENCE IN ORDER TO DISPEL THE DOUBTS WHICH EXIST , AND SECONDLY THAT THE EXPORTER IS REQUIRED TO COOPERATE IN THE INQUIRY BY TRANSMITTING ALL SUCH INFORMATION AS HE IS ABLE TO FURNISH . IT IS ONLY WHERE SUCH AN INQUIRY HAS FAILED TO ESTABLISH THE USE TO WHICH THE PRODUCT IN QUESTION HAS BEEN PUT THAT THE MATTER OF THE BURDEN OF PROOF ARISES .  ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1380/, THE T CONTROL COPY CONSTITUTES PROOF THAT ' CUSTOMS IMPORT FORMALITIES HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND THAT THE DUTIES AND CHARGES HAVING EQUIVALENT EFFECT PAYABLE IN THE IMPORTING MEMBER STATE HAVE BEEN CHARGED ' . ALTHOUGH THAT DOCUMENT MUST CONTAIN A DECLARATION BY THE CLAIMANT SPECIFYING THAT THE PRODUCT IS ' INTENDED FOR ENTRY FOR HOME USE '  IN THE IMPORTING MEMBER STATE , IT DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY STATEMENT BY THE AUTHORITIES OF THE IMPORTING MEMBER STATE CERTIFYING THAT THE INTENDED PURPOSE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN ACHIEVED . IN FACT THAT EVENT OCCURS AFTER THE DATE ON WHICH THOSE AUTHORITIES PLACE THE CERTIFICATE ON THE DOCUMENT AT THE TIME OF THE COMPLETION OF THE CUSTOMS IMPORT FORMALITIES . IN THAT RESPECT THE PROVISION IN QUESTION DIFFERS FROM RULES WHICH ALSO REQUIRE THE END USE OF THE IMPORTED PRODUCT TO BE MENTIONED IN THE CERTIFICATE PLACED ON THE CONTROL COPY .  IT FOLLOWS THAT THE PROBLEM OF FURNISHING PROOF OF ACTUAL ENTRY FOR HOME USE IS NOT RESOLVED BY THE PROVISION REQUIRING PRODUCTION OF A T CONTROL COPY WHICH HAS BEEN DULY COMPLETED AND CERTIFIED BY THE AUTHORITIES OF THE IMPORTING MEMBER STATE .  AS STATED ABOVE , THE EXPORTER MAY , IN HIS OWN INTEREST , ENSURE THAT PURCHASERS DO NOT DIVERT THE PRODUCT BY FRAUDULENT MEANS FROM ITS INTENDED PURPOSE AS SPECIFIED BY THE EXPORTER HIMSELF IN THE T CONTROL COPY . THE EXPORTER IS THEREFORE IN THE BEST POSITION TO FURNISH PROOF RELATING TO THE ACTUAL ENTRY OF THE PRODUCT FOR HOME USE . IF , OWING TO GRAVE SUSPICIONS BASED ON OBJECTIVE GROUNDS , THE ADMINISTRATION HAS COMMENCED INQUIRIES IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH WHETHER THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN DIVERTED BY FRAUDULENT MEANS FROM ITS INTENDED PURPOSE AS SPECIFIED IN THE CONTROL COPY AND IF THOSE INQUIRIES , NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE ENDEAVOURS WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION IS REQUIRED TO MAKE , HAVE FAILED TO DISPEL THOSE SUSPICIONS , THE ADMINISTRATION IS ENTITLED TO DEMAND , AS A CONDITION FOR PAYMENT , THE PRODUCTION OF PROOF OF ACTUAL ENTRY FOR HOME USE .  THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION SUBMITTED TO THE COURT MUST THEREFORE BE THAT WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE EXPORTING MEMBER STATE , PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1380/AND OWING TO GRAVE SUSPICIONS BASED ON OBJECTIVE GROUNDS , HAS COMMENCED INQUIRIES IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH WHETHER THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN DIVERTED BY FRAUDULENT MEANS FROM ITS INTENDED PURPOSE AS SPECIFIED IN THE CONTROL COPY , THE EXPORTER IS REQUIRED TO COOPERATE IN THE INQUIRY BY TRANSMITTING ALL SUCH INFORMATION AS HE IS ABLE TO FURNISH . IF , NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE ENDEAVOURS WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION IS REQUIRED TO MAKE , THE INQUIRIES HAVE FAILED TO DISPEL THOSE SUSPICIONS , THE EXPORTING MEMBER STATE IS ENTITLED TO REFUSE PAYMENT OF THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS WHICH THE IMPORTING MEMBER STATE IS REQUIRED TO GRANT , UNLESS PROOF IS FURNISHED THAT THE PRODUCT HAS ACTUALLY ENTERED THE LATTER STATE FOR HOME USE .  THIRD AND FOURTH QUESTIONS  IN VIEW OF THE ANSWERS GIVEN TO THE FIRST TWO QUESTIONS , IT IS NO LONGER NECESSARY TO CONSIDER THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUESTIONS WHICH ARE BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT , IN THE AFOREMENTIONED CIRCUMSTANCES , THE EXPORTER IS ENTITLED TO MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS WITHOUT FURNISHING PROOF OF ACTUAL ENTRY FOR HOME USE .
