Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT , BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE MEASURES NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 81/177/EEC OF FEBRUARY ON THE HARMONIZATION OF PROCEDURES FOR THE EXPORT OF COMMUNITY GOODS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) AND COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 82/347/EEC OF APRIL LAYING DOWN CERTAIN PROVISIONS FOR IMPLEMENTING COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 81/177/EEC ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY , 
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON MAY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION BEFORE THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT , BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE MEASURES NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 81/177/EEC OF FEBRUARY ON THE HARMONIZATION OF PROCEDURES FOR THE EXPORT OF COMMUNITY GOODS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) AND COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 82/347/EEC OF APRIL LAYING DOWN CERTAIN PROVISIONS FOR IMPLEMENTING COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 81/177/EEC ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAD FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY .  ARTICLE OF DIRECTIVE 81/AND ARTICLE OF DIRECTIVE 82/PROVIDE THAT THE MEMBER STATES MUST ADOPT THE LAWS OR REGULATIONS , OR TAKE THE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION , NECESSARY FOR IMPLEMENTING THOSE DIRECTIVES BEFORE JANUARY AND MUST INFORM THE COMMISSION OF SUCH MEASURES .  SINCE THE COMMISSION RECEIVED NO SUCH INFORMATION FROM THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT , IT INITIATED THE PROCEDURE PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE . NEITHER ITS LETTER OF NOVEMBER REQUESTING THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC TO SUBMIT ITS OBSERVATIONS NOR THE REASONED OPINION OF FEBRUARY ELICITED A REPLY FROM THE ITALIAN AUTHORITIES . CONSEQUENTLY , THE COMMISSION BROUGHT THIS ACTION ON MAY FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAD FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS .  THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DENY THE FACTS ALLEGED BY THE COMMISSION BUT MAINTAINS THAT THE FULL AND FAITHFUL TRANSPOSITION INTO NATIONAL LAW OF THE DIRECTIVES IN QUESTION MAKES IT NECESSARY TO ADOPT MEASURES REQUIRING AMENDMENTS TO SOME PROVISIONS OF THE CONSOLIDATED CUSTOMS LAWS IN FORCE . FOR THAT PURPOSE A WORKING PARTY WAS SET UP BY DECREE OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE OF JUNE . IN CARRYING OUT THAT DIFFICULT TASK IT WAS ALSO NECESSARY TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE RELEVANT CHANGES RECENTLY MADE BY DECREE NO OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF MAY , WHICH IMPLEMENTED DIRECTIVE 83/643/EEC ON THE FACILITATION OF PHYSICAL INSPECTIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE FORMALITIES IN RESPECT OF THE CARRIAGE OF GOODS BETWEEN MEMBER STATES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ).  IN ITS REPLY THE COMMISSION POINTS OUT THAT THE FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT THE DIRECTIVE DOES NOT MAKE THE WORK OF REVISING THE CONSOLIDATED CUSTOMS LAWS ANY EASIER . THE RECENT SETTING-UP OF A WORKING PARTY ALSO SHOWS THAT THE PROBLEM WILL NOT BE RESOLVED IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE . THE FACT THAT DIRECTIVE 83/HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED HAS NO EFFECT WHATSOEVER ON THE FOREGOING OBSERVATIONS , SINCE ITS SUBJECT-MATTER IS NOT EXACTLY THE SAME .  THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT DID NOT LODGE A REJOINDER . AT THE HEARING , IT ADMITTED THAT , DESPITE ITS FIRM INTENTION TO BRING THE PROCEDURE INITIATED TO IMPLEMENT THE DIRECTIVES TO A RAPID CONCLUSION , IT WAS NOT YET IN A POSITION TO CONFIRM THAT THIS HAD BEEN DONE .  IT SHOULD BE RECALLED THAT THE COURT HAS CONSISTENTLY HELD THAT A MEMBER STATE CANNOT PLEAD PROVISIONS , PRACTICES OR CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING IN ITS INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OBLIGATIONS AND TIME-LIMITS LAID DOWN IN DIRECTIVES .  IT FOLLOWS FROM THE FOREGOING THAT , BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIODS THE MEASURES PROVIDED FOR IN COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 81/177/EEC OF FEBRUARY AND COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 82/347/EEC OF APRIL , THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY .
