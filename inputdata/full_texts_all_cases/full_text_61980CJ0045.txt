Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY BY NOT IMPLEMENTING COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 76/767/EEC OF JULY ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO COMMON PROVISIONS FOR PRESSURE VESSELS AND METHODS OF INSPECTING THEM ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON FEBRUARY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC , BY FAILING TO ADOPT , WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD , THE PROVISIONS NEEDED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 76/767/EEC OF JULY ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO COMMON PROVISIONS FOR PRESSURE VESSELS AND METHODS OF INSPECTING THEM ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ONE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY .   PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 76/767/EEC , THE MEMBER STATES WERE OBLIGED TO PUT INTO FORCE THE LAWS , REGULATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS NEEDED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THAT DIRECTIVE WITHIN MONTHS OF ITS NOTIFICATION . THAT PERIOD EXPIRED ON JANUARY .    THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DISPUTE THE FACT THAT IT HAS NOT FULFILLED THAT OBLIGATION . IT EXPLAINS THAT THE DELAY IN THE INCORPORATION OF THE DIRECTIVE INTO THE INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM ARISES FROM THE FACT THAT IT CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO HAVE ADOPTED BY THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT A DRAFT LAW GIVING IT LEGISLATIVE POWERS TO ADOPT THE NECESSARY MEASURES BY WAY OF REGULATIONS . THE DRAFT LAW COULD NOT BE ADOPTED WITHIN THE DESIRED PERIOD OWING TO THE PREMATURE DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT AND IT HAS AGAIN BEEN LAID BEFORE PARLIAMENT DURING THE PRESENT SESSION . THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT THEN CLAIMS THAT ,     WHILST AWAITING THE APPROVAL OF THAT DRAFT LAW , WHICH SHOULD BE IMMINENT , IT PREFERRED FOR REASONS OF EXPEDIENCY AND LEGAL CERTAINTY ' ' NOT TO BRING PARTLY INTO FORCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE MEASURES CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF DIRECTIVE 76/767/EEC , THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE REQUIRED A LAW ' ' .   THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES CANNOT EXPUNGE THE FAILURE TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS WITH WHICH THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC IS CHARGED . ACCORDING TO WELL-ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW , A MEMBER STATE MAY NOT PLEAD PROVISIONS , PRACTICES OR CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING IN ITS INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OBLIGATIONS AND TIME-LIMITS RESULTING FROM COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES .   IT MUST THEREFORE BE HELD THAT BY FAILING TO ADOPT , WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD , THE PROVISIONS NEEDED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 76/767/EEC , THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ONE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY .  
Decision on costs
