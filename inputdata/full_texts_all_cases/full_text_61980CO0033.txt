Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES ORDERING THE DEFENDANTS TO DESIST FORTHWITH FROM APPLYING IN THE CASE OF THE APPLICANTS COUNCIL REGULATIONS NOS 3085/AND 3086/OF DECEMBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L OF DECEMBER , PP . AND ) AMENDING THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE MONETARY     PARITIES TO BE USED IN THE PAYMENT IN PARTICULAR OF REMUNERATION AND PENSIONS RESPECTIVELY , AND CONSEQUENTLY ADJUSTING THE WEIGHTINGS APPLICABLE TO SUCH MONETARY ENTITLEMENTS , 
Grounds
THE APPLICANTS ASK THE COURT TO ORDER THAT THE APPLICATION OF COUNCIL REGULATIONS NOS 3085/AND 3086/OF DECEMBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L OF DECEMBER , PP . AND ) BE SUSPENDED IN REGARD TO THEM .   THESE REGULATIONS , WHICH ADJUST THE MONETARY PARITIES TO BE USED IN THE CALCULATION OF REMUNERATION AND PENSIONS OF OFFICIALS AS WELL AS THE WEIGHTINGS APPLIED TO THEM , IS CLAIMED TO CAUSE A REDUCTION OF MORE THAN 50% IN THE     AMOUNTS PAID TO THE APPLICANTS AS PENSIONS , THUS CAUSING THEM SERIOUS FINANCIAL DAMAGE .   ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COURT PROVIDES THAT :   - ' ' AN APPLICATION TO SUSPEND THE OPERATION OF ANY MEASURE ADOPTED BY AN INSTITUTION . . . SHALL BE ADMISSIBLE ONLY IF THE APPLICANT IS CHALLENGING THAT MEASURE IN PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COURT . ' '  THAT CONDITION IS FULFILLED IN THE CASE OF THE APPLICANTS .  - AN APPLICATION OF THIS KIND IS REQUIRED TO ' ' STATE THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF THE DISPUTE , THE CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO URGENCY AND THE FACTUAL AND LEGAL GROUNDS ESTABLISHING A PRIMA FACIE CASE FOR THE INTERIM MEASURES APPLIED FOR ' ' .   IN NUMEROUS PREVIOUS CASES THE COURT HAS HELD THAT AN APPLICANT SEEKING THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES MUST BE IN SUCH A POSITION AS TO BE LIKELY TO SUFFER IRREPARABLE DAMAGE .   THE APPLICATION BY THE APPLICANTS DOES NOT SHOW THAT THEY ARE SUFFERING DAMAGE WHICH CANNOT BE MADE GOOD BY THE DEFINITIVE JUDGMENT . IF THE APPLICANTS SUCCEED THEY WILL BE ENTITLED TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NET AMOUNTS RESULTING FROM THE APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS NOS 3085/AND 3086/AND THE PENSIONS PAYABLE BEFORE THOSE REGULATIONS CAME INTO FORCE .   IF , ON THE OTHER HAND , THE APPLICANTS ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL AND A SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF REGULATIONS NOS 3085/AND 3086/HAS IN THE MEANTIME BEEN ORDERED , THE COMMISSION WOULD BE EMPOWERED UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS TO RECOVER THE SUMS OVERPAID . THIS SITUATION MIGHT ALSO ENTAIL FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES FOR THE APPLICANTS .   CONSEQUENTLY THE APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES MUST BE DISMISSED .
