Appeal: against the judgment of the Court of First Instance (Fourth Chamber) of February in Case T-471/Karatzoglou v EAR [2006] ECR-SC I-A-2-and II-A-2-000, seeking to have that judgment set aside. 
      
Held: the judgment is set aside and the case referred back to the Court of First Instance.
      
Summary
Officials – Principles – Protection of legitimate expectations 
(Conditions of employment of other servants, Arts to 50)
The fact that the amendment of a temporary servant’s contract created an ambiguous situation, which could have given the impression
         that the administration had restricted its power under Articles to of the Conditions of employment of other servants
         to terminate the contract, does not give rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of that temporary servant as to the
         duration of his contract. An uncertain contractual situation cannot form the basis of precise assurances on the part of the
         administration, which are necessary to give rise to legitimate expectations. 
      
Nor, in that respect, is it possible to rely on the principle to the effect that the weaker party to an employment contract
         can expect vague provisions of the contract to be interpreted in his favour. Factors linked to a temporary servant’s contractual
         situation in relation to his employer cannot make up for the absence of one of the preconditions for establishing the existence
         of a legitimate expectation.
