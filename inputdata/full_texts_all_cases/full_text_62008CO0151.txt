Operative part 
Article 33(1) of Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of May on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating
         to turnover taxes – Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment, as amended by Council Directive 91/680/EEC
         of December 1991, must be interpreted as meaning that it does not preclude the charging of the variable or proportional
         amount of the duty on transfers of assets and documented legal transactions when it is chargeable on the conclusion of a purchase
         by an undertaking whose business activity consists of buying and selling immovable property or purchasing immovable property
         for development or letting.
