Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE PAYMENT OF A RESETTLEMENT ALLOWANCE , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON FEBRUARY VICTOR EVENS , A FORMER OFFICIAL OF THE COURT OF AUDITORS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR THE GRANT OF A RESETTLEMENT ALLOWANCE , FOLLOWING HIS RETIREMENT EQUAL TO TWO MONTHS OF HIS BASIC SALARY .   THE APPLICANT , WHO IS MARRIED AND THE FATHER OF TWO CHILDREN , BECAME AN OFFICIAL OF THE ASSEMBLY OF THE ECSC IN LUXEMBOURG IN . PURSUANT TO THE ECSC PROVISIONS THEN IN FORCE AN INSTALLATION ALLOWANCE EQUAL TO FOUR MONTHS '  SALARY WAS PAID TO HIM BECAUSE HE AND HIS FAMILY SETTLED IN     LUXEMBOURG . WHEN IN HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE AUDIT BOARD IN BRUSSELS HE SETTLED WITH HIS FAMILY IN LIEGE AND RECEIVED AN INSTALLATION ALLOWANCE EQUAL TO TWO MONTHS '  BASIC SALARY . WHEN HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE COURT OF AUDITORS IN THE APPLICANT SETTLED IN LUXEMBOURG BUT HIS FAMILY CONTINUED TO LIVE IN LIEGE AND FOR THAT REASON HE ONLY RECEIVED AN INSTALLATION ALLOWANCE EQUAL TO ONE MONTH ' S BASIC SALARY .   THE APPLICANT WAS RETIRED WITH EFFECT FROM JUNE . HE THEN WENT BACK TO LIVE WITH HIS FAMILY IN LIEGE . ON THAT OCCASION THE COURT OF AUDITORS GRANTED HIM A RESETTLEMENT ALLOWANCE EQUAL TO HIS BASIC SALARY FOR ONE MONTH . ON THE OTHER HAND IT REFUSED TO GRANT HIM A RESETTLEMENT ALLOWANCE EQUAL TO TWO MONTHS '  BASIC SALARY ON THE GROUND THAT HIS FAMILY WHICH HAD CONTINUED TO LIVE IN LIEGE HAD NOT HAD TO RESETTLE IN THAT CITY .   THE DIFFERENCE OF ONE MONTH ' S BASIC SALARY BETWEEN THE RESETTLEMENT ALLOWANCE CLAIMED BY THE APPLICANT AND THE SUM GRANTED BY WAY OF SUCH ALLOWANCE BY THE COURT OF AUDITORS IS THE ISSUE IN THE PRESENT CASE .   IN SUPPORT OF HIS ACTION THE APPLICANT CLAIMS THAT ACCORDING TO THE CLEAR WORDING OF ARTICLE OF ANNEX VII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS HE IS ENTITLED TO A RESETTLEMENT ALLOWANCE OF TWO MONTHS '  BASIC SALARY SINCE HE RECEIVED THE HOUSEHOLD ALLOWANCE AND HE HAS RESETTLED WITH HIS FAMILY IN LIEGE . THE APPLICANT REFERS MOREOVER TO THE TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS OF REGULATION NO 259/OF THE COUNCIL OF FEBRUARY , ARTICLE ( ) OF THE ECSC STAFF REGULATIONS AND TO ARTICLE OF THE FORMER GENERAL REGULATIONS OF THE ECSC OF .    ACCORDING TO THE COURT OF AUDITORS THE PROVISION CONTAINED IN ARTICLE ( ) OF ANNEX VII MUST ALSO APPLY TO THE SITUATION COVERED BY ARTICLE SO THAT THE RESETTLEMENT ALLOWANCE IS REDUCED TO ONE MONTH ' S BASIC SALARY IN A CASE SUCH AS THAT OF THE APPLICANT .   IT SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT , AS THE COURT HELD IN ITS JUDGMENT OF JULY IN CASE 10/BECKER V COMMISSION ( ) ECR , THE     SAFEGUARD CLAUSE CONTAINED IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS IN FAVOUR OF OFFICIALS WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN SUBJECT TO THE FORMER GENERAL REGULATIONS OF THE ECSC OF IS NO LONGER APPLICABLE SINCE THE PRESENT SALARIES REPRESENT MORE THAN DOUBLE THE SALARIES PRIOR TO AND AN OFFICIAL WHO TERMINATES HIS EMPLOYMENT AFTER THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE NEW SYSTEM IS NO LONGER FINANCIALLY IN A LESS FAVOURABLE POSITION THAN IF HE HAD LEFT HIS EMPLOYMENT BEFORE THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE NEW SYSTEM .   IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY IN THE PRESENT CASE TO APPLY ARTICLE OF ANNEX VII OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS IN SO FAR AS IT REFERS TO AN OFFICIAL WHO IS ENTITLED TO THE HOUSEHOLD ALLOWANCE .   ARTICLE ( ) PROVIDES THAT AN OFFICIAL SHALL BE ENTITLED ON TERMINATION OF SERVICE ' ' TO A RESETTLEMENT ALLOWANCE EQUAL TO TWO MONTHS '  BASIC SALARY IN THE CASE OF AN OFFICIAL WHO IS ENTITLED TO THE HOUSEHOLD ALLOWANCE ' '  AND DOES NOT MENTION ANY REQUIREMENT THAT THE OFFICIAL ' S FAMILY MUST RESETTLE . ON THE OTHER HAND ARTICLE ( ) PROVIDES THAT THE ALLOWANCE IS TO BE PAID ' ' AGAINST EVIDENCE THAT THE OFFICIAL AND HIS FAMILY . . . . HAVE RESETTLED ' ' . THE CASE OF AN OFFICIAL ENTITLED TO THE HOUSEHOLD ALLOWANCE WHO RESETTLES WITHOUT HIS FAMILY IS NOT EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR IN THE ARTICLE .   IN ORDER TO INTERPRET ARTICLE IT IS NOT PERMISSIBLE , AS THE APPLICANT PROPOSES , TO RELY ON THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF THE GENERAL REGULATIONS OF THE ECSC OF . THE PROVISIONS OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AT PRESENT IN FORCE MUST BE INTERPRETED WITH REGARD TO THEIR CONTEXT AND PURPOSE AND NOT IN THE LIGHT OF RULES WHICH HAVE BEEN REPEALED .   IT IS APPARENT FROM ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND FROM THE HEADING OF SECTION OF ANNEX VII THERETO THAT ARTICLE OF THAT ANNEX REFERS TO THE REIMBURSEMENT , ON A LUMP-SUM BASIS , OF EXPENSES WHICH ARE OCCASIONED BY THE RESETTLEMENT OF THE OFFICIAL AFTER THE TERMINATION OF HIS SERVICE AND WHICH ARE NOT COVERED BY THE REIMBURSEMENT OF REMOVAL EXPENSES REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE OF ANNEX VII . THE AMOUNT OF THOSE EXPENSES WILL GENERALLY BE HIGHER IN THE CASE OF CHANGE OF THE PLACE OF RESIDENCE OF AN OFFICIAL AND HIS FAMILY THAN IN THE CASE OF AN OFFICIAL WHO REJOINS HIS FAMILY .       A LIKE DIFFERENCE IN THE EXPENSES TO BE REIMBURSED HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT , AS REGARDS THE INSTALLATION ALLOWANCE TO BE PAID ON TAKING UP EMPLOYMENT , BY THE FIRST SENTENCE OF ARTICLE ( ) WHICH PROVIDES THAT THE OFFICIAL WHO IS ENTITLED TO THE HOUSEHOLD ALLOWANCE AND DOES NOT SETTLE WITH HIS FAMILY IS TO RECEIVE ONLY HALF THE ALLOWANCE TO WHICH HE WOULD OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED . SIMILARLY , IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PURPOSE OF ARTICLE NOT TO GRANT THE RESETTLEMENT ALLOWANCE AT THE RATE OF TWO MONTHS '  BASIC SALARY TO AN OFFICIAL WHO DOES NOT RESETTLE WITH HIS FAMILY . THAT INTERPRETATION IS MOREOVER CONFIRMED BY THE WORDING OF ARTICLE ( ) WHICH EXPRESSLY REQUIRES EVIDENCE THAT THE OFFICIAL ' S FAMILY HAS RESETTLED .   SINCE IT IS COMMON GROUND THAT THE APPLICANT ' S FAMILY DID NOT CHANGE ITS PLACE OF RESIDENCE WITH HIM WHEN HE RESETTLED IN LIEGE THE COURT OF AUDITORS COULD NOT THEREFORE LAWFULLY ALLOW THE APPLICANT ' S CLAIM FOR THE GRANT OF A RESETTLEMENT ALLOWANCE EQUAL TO HIS BASIC SALARY FOR TWO MONTHS .   THE APPLICATION MUST THEREFORE BE DISMISSED .
