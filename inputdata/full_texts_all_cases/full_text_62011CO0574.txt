Reference for a preliminary ruling — Landgericht Düsseldorf — Interpretation of Articles and of Regulation (EC) No 469/of the European Parliament and of the Council of May concerning the supplementary protection certificate for medicinal
                  products (OJ L 152, p. 1) — Scope of the certificate — Protection solely of medicinal products consisting only of the
                  protected active ingredient or protection extended to medicinal products consisting of the protected active ingredient in
                  combination with another active ingredient.
               
Operative part 
Articles and of Regulation (EC) No 469/of the European Parliament and of the Council of May concerning the
         supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products must be interpreted as meaning that, where a ‘product’ consisting
         of an active ingredient was protected by a basic patent and the holder of that patent was able to rely on the protection conferred
         by that patent for that ‘product’ in order to oppose the marketing of a medicinal product containing that active ingredient
         in combination with one or more other active ingredients, a supplementary protection certificate granted for that ‘product’
         enables its holder, after the basic patent has expired, to oppose the marketing by a third party of a medicinal product containing
         that product for a use of the ‘product’, as a medicinal product, which was authorised before that certificate expired.
