Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE COMMISSION DECISION OF JUNE ASSIGNING THE APPLICANT AS AN ADVISER TO DIRECTORATE IX-A , PERSONNEL , WITH EFFECT FROM AUGUST , IN SO FAR AS IT IS TO AN A POST IN A PERSONAL CAPACITY , FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE POST OCCUPIED BY THE APPLICANT IS AND MUST BE AN ESTABLISHED A POST , AND ALSO FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE REJECTION OF HIS REQUEST OF JULY AND OF HIS COMPLAINT OF DECEMBER , 
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JUNE , MR BOSMANS , AN OFFICIAL OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE COMMISSION DECISION OF JUNE ASSIGNING HIM AS AN ADVISER TO DIRECTORATE IX-A WITH EFFECT FROM AUGUST , IN SO FAR AS IT WAS TO AN A POST IN A PERSONAL CAPACITY , AND FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE REJECTION OF HIS REQUEST OF JULY AND OF HIS COMPLAINT OF DECEMBER WHICH ASKED THAT THAT POST SHOULD BE AN ESTABLISHED A POST .       THE APPLICANT ENTERED THE SERVICE OF THE COMMISSION ON SEPTEMBER IN GRADE A . HE WAS PROMOTED TO GRADE A WITH EFFECT FROM MARCH , THEN TO GRADE A AS HEAD OF DIVISION WITH EFFECT FROM OCTOBER , AND HE OCCUPIED CORRESPONDING POSTS IN THE COMMISSION ' S LIST OF POSTS . ON AUGUST HE WAS ASSIGNED TO A POST IN WHICH HE RETAINED HIS GRADE A IN A PERSONAL CAPACITY .   INDEED , ACCORDING TO THE LIST OF POSTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL ON NOVEMBER AND A DETAILED LIST OF POSTS DATED OCTOBER , THE POST TO WHICH THE APPLICANT WAS APPOINTED ON AUGUST WAS AN A 5/A POST , BUT WAS OCCUPIED BY HIM AS AN OFFICIAL IN GRADE A IN A PERSONAL CAPACITY . FOLLOWING THAT ASSIGNMENT , THE APPLICANT LODGED A REQUEST WITH THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY ASKING THAT HIS NEW POST SHOULD BE REPLACED BY ANOTHER IDENTICAL AS TO ITS ESTABLISHED NATURE TO THAT WHICH HE HAD HELD WITHOUT INTERRUPTION SINCE OCTOBER . HOWEVER , THAT REQUEST WAS WITHDRAWN ON FEBRUARY .    ON JUNE , THE APPLICANT WAS TRANSFERRED TO A POST AS AN ADVISER IN DIRECTORATE A , PERSONNEL , OF DIRECTORATE GENERAL IX OF THE COMMISSION . THE APPLICANT DISPUTES THE LEGALITY OF THAT DECISION , INASMUCH AS IT ASSIGNS HIM TO A POST IN A PERSONAL CAPACITY , AS WELL AS THE REJECTION OF HIS REQUEST OF JULY THAT , IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY SHOULD CONFIRM THAT HE OCCUPIED ONE OF THE A POSTS IN THE LIST OF POSTS OTHER THAN THE A POSTS IN A PERSONAL CAPACITY .   HE CLAIMS THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN INFRINGEMENT OF ARTICLES , AND ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , OF THE COMMISSION DECISION UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS DEFINING THE DUTIES AND POWERS ATTACHING TO EACH BASIC POST IN ANNEX I , PART A , OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , OF THE COMMISSION DECISION OF DECEMBER PROMOTING THE APPLICANT TO GRADE A , AND ALSO A BREACH OF PRINCIPLES OF LAW , IN PARTICULAR THE PRINCIPLES OF EQUALITY , GOOD ADMINISTRATION AND DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE .   ACCORDING TO THE APPLICANT , HIS ASSIGNMENT TO AN A POST IN A PERSONAL CAPACITY CONFLICTS WITH THE RIGHT OF AN OFFICIAL TO BE ASSIGNED FROM THE     BEGINNING AND THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER TO AN ESTABLISHED POST IN THE LIST OF POSTS OF HIS INSTITUTION CORRESPONDING TO HIS GRADE NOT ONLY SO FAR AS THE NATURE OF THE DUTIES AND THE DESCRIPTION OF THE POST ARE CONCERNED , BUT ALSO IN RELATION TO THE CLASSIFICATION OF THAT POST IN THE LIST OF POSTS .   HE CONSIDERS THAT HIS ASSIGNMENT IS THE RESULT OF A PRACTICE WHICH HAS NO LEGAL BASIS AND WHICH CONSTITUTES A SOURCE OF CONFUSION AND UNEQUAL TREATMENT OF OFFICIALS .   THE COMMISSION CONTENDS THAT THE ASSIGNMENT TO AN A POST IN A PERSONAL CAPACITY HAS NO EFFECT ON THE APPLICANT ' S POSITION UNDER THE STAFF REGULATIONS OR ON HIS MATERIAL AND NON-MATERIAL INTERESTS , SINCE THE POST IN A PERSONAL CAPACITY IS EXCLUSIVELY A BUDGETARY CONCEPT WHICH DOES NOT AFFECT THE DEFINITION OF POSTS UNDER THE STAFF REGULATIONS , RESULTING PARTICULARLY FROM ARTICLE AND ANNEX I , PART A , THEREOF .   THE COMMISSION FURTHER CLAIMS THAT THE APPLICATION IS INADMISSIBLE , INASMUCH AS IT CALLS IN QUESTION A SITUATION WHICH HAS EXISTED FOR AT LEAST EIGHT YEARS WITHOUT INTERRUPTION , SINCE THE DECISION OF JUNE HAS HAD NO EFFECT ON THE APPLICANT ' S POSITION UNDER THE STAFF REGULATIONS OR ON HIS MATERIAL AND NON-MATERIAL INTERESTS .   IT IS COMMON GROUND THAT THE APPLICATION SEEKS TO CHALLENGE THE DECISION OF JUNE BY WHICH THE APPLICANT WAS ASSIGNED AS AN ADVISER TO AN A POST IN A PERSONAL CAPACITY . BY ASSIGNING THE APPLICANT TO AN A POST IN A PERSONAL CAPACITY , THE DECISION IN QUESTION DID NOT ALTER HIS POSITION UNDER THE STAFF REGULATIONS , WHICH RESULTED FROM HIS ASSIGNMENT TO AN A POST IN A PERSONAL CAPACITY WITH EFFECT FROM AUGUST .    IF FOLLOWS THAT IN SO FAR AS THE CONTESTED MEASURE RETAINS THE APPLICANT IN AN A POST IN A PERSONAL CAPACITY , IT NEITHER ALTERS NOR SEEKS TO ALTER THE APPLICANT ' S POSITION . THEREFORE IN THIS RESPECT IT IS NOT AN ACT WHICH ADVERSELY AFFECTS HIM .   THE APPLICANT DOES NOT CONTEST THE LEGALITY OF HIS TRANSFER TO THE POST OF ADVISER , WHICH IS THE TRUE PURPOSE OF THE CONTESTED DECISION OF JUNE .        THE APPLICATION MUST THEREFORE BE DISMISSED AS UNFOUNDED AND IT IS UNNECESSARY TO EXAMINE THE OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY RAISED BY THE COMMISSION .  
Decision on costs
