Re: 
Appeal against the judgment of the Court of First Instance (First Chamber) of December in Case T-138/É.R. and Others
 v 
Council and Commission
, by which the Court dismissed as partially inadmissible and, for the remainder, as unfounded, the action brought by the applicants
                  seeking compensation under Article EC and the second paragraph of Article EC for the damage allegedly suffered as
                  a consequence of the infection and subsequent death of members of their families who suffered from a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
                  disease, which was linked to the outbreak and spread in Europe of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, for which the Council
                  and the Commission were allegedly responsible – Conditions giving rise to non contractual liability of the Communities.
               
Operative part: 
 
The appeal is dismissed.
 
É.R., O.O., J.R., A.R., B.P.R., T.D., J.D., D.D., V.D., D.E., É.E., C.R., H.R., M.S.R., I.R., B.R., M.R., and C.S. are ordered
