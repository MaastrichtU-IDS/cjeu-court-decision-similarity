Operative part:

	Members of the public concerned, within the meaning of Articles 1(2) and 10a of Council Directive 85/337/EEC of June on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, as amended by Directive 2003/35/EC
                     of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 2003, and within the meaning of Articles 2(14) and 15a of Council
                     Directive 96/61/EC of September concerning integrated pollution prevention and control, as amended by Directive 2003/35,
                     the latter provisions having been repeated in Article 2(15) and (16) of Directive 2008/1/EC of the European Parliament and
                     of the Council of January concerning integrated pollution prevention and control, must have access to a review procedure
                     in respect of a decision by which a body which forms part of the judicial organisation of a Member State has ruled on an application
                     for project authorisation, whatever the role they may have played during examination of that application by taking part in
                     the proceedings before that body and putting forward their views on that occasion;

                     amended by Directive 2003/35, and 96/61, as amended by Directive 2003/35, respectively to environmental protection associations
