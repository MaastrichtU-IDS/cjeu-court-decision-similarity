Grounds
UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY A NATURAL PERSON MAY COMPLAIN TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE THAT AN INSTITUTION OF THE COMMUNITY HAS FAILED TO ADDRESS TO HIM ANY ACT OTHER THAN A RECOMMENDATION OR AN OPINION . IN THESE CASES THE APPLICANTS HAVE NOT STATED WHAT ACT , WITHIN THE MEANING OF THAT ARTICLE , THE COMMISSION HAS FAILED TO ADDRESS TO THEM .  ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF THE TREATY THE COURT OF JUSTICE HAS JURISDICTION IN DISPUTES RELATING TO COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGE PROVIDED FOR IN THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE CONCERNING THE NON-CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY OF THE COMMUNITY . THESE ACTIONS , HOWEVER , ARE FOR COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGE ALLEGED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE CONDUCT OF AN INSTITUTION AFFECTING THE PROGRESS OF THE CAREER OF ONE OF ITS OFFICIALS OR SERVANTS , EVEN THOUGH THE LATTER HAS BEEN IN A POSITION TO AVAIL HIMSELF OF THE OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED BY THE TREATY TO CHALLENGE ANY DECISION OF THE INSTITUTION CONCERNED WHICH WAS INTENDED TO , OR IN FACT DID , PLACE OR KEEP HIM IN UNLAWFUL CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT AND , IF NEED BE , FOR THIS PURPOSE TO BRING AN ACTION BEFORE THE COURT . IT WOULD BE CONTRARY TO THE SYSTEM OF LEGAL REMEDIES ADOPTED BY COMMUNITY LAW FOR RECTIFYING IRREGULARITIES IN CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT TO CONCEDE THAT BY A MISUSE OF PROCEDURE AN ACTION FOR DAMAGES BASED ON THE SAME FACTS MAY BE BROUGHT BY THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY OF AN OFFICIAL OR OTHER SERVANT ACTING ON THEIR OWN BEHALF , EVEN IF THEY ALLEGE THAT THEY HAVE PERSONALLY SUFFERED DAMAGE IN THIS CONNEXION . THESE ACTIONS DO NOT THEREFORE FALL WITHIN THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .  IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE COURT PLAINLY HAS NO JURISDICTION TO TAKE COGNIZANCE OF THE APPLICATIONS . CONSEQUENTLY IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE COURT TO APPLY ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE AND TO DECLARE OF ITS OWN MOTION WITHOUT OPENING THE ORAL PROCEDURE THAT THE ACTIONS ARE INADMISSIBLE .
