Summary
1.There is no provision in the Staff Regulations either for the regrading of a post or for reclassification as such ( see the judgment of May in Case 21/Huybrechts v Commission (( )) ECR ).  2.The essential purpose of the vacancy notice is to give those interested the most accurate information possible about the conditions of eligibility for the post in question in order to enable them to judge whether they should apply for it ( see the judgment of October in Case 188/Grassi v Council (( )) ECR ).  3.Once a post to be filled has been lawfully reserved to a Spanish national under the provisional recruitment arrangements established by Regulation No 3517/85, an official who, on account of his nationality, was not eligible to occupy the post, has no interest in challenging the choice of the Spanish national made by the institution in order to fill the post in question .
