Operative part 
Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of May concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial
         practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC of
         the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/of the European Parliament and of the Council
         (‘Unfair Commercial Practices Directive’) must be interpreted as meaning that it does not apply to national legislation, such
         as that at issue in the main proceedings, which does not pursue objectives related to consumer protection.
