Subject of the case
APPLICATION TO SUSPEND THE ENFORCEMENT OF A COMMISSION DECISION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE AND THE FOURTH PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY AND ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE , 
Grounds
ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY PROVIDES THAT ACTIONS BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT OF JUSTICE DO NOT HAVE SUSPENSORY EFFECT . THE COURT MAY , HOWEVER , IF CIRCUMSTANCES SO REQUIRE , ORDER THAT APPLICATION OF THE CONTESTED ACT BE SUSPENDED . ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE PROVIDES THAT ENFORCEMENT OF THE ORDER MAY BE MADE CONDITIONAL ON THE LODGING BY THE APPLICANT OF SECURITY , OF AN AMOUNT AND NATURE TO BE FIXED IN THE LIGHT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES .   IN THIS APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES , THE APPLICANT SEEKS THE SUSPENSION OF THE OBLIGATION TO PAY THE FINE IMPOSED ON IT . ARTICLE OF THE OPERATIVE PART OF THE CONTESTED DECISION PROVIDES THAT IN THE EVENT OF AN APPEAL TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE BY ONE OF THE UNDERTAKINGS FINED , THE RECOVERY OF THE FINE IMPOSED ON THAT UNDERTAKING IS TO BE SUSPENDED ON CONDITION THAT IT PROVIDES A BANKER ' S GUARANTEE FOR THE AMOUNT INVOLVED .       THE CIRCUMSTANCES UPON WHICH THE COMMISSION BASES ITS DEPARTURE FROM ITS FORMER PRACTICE REGARDING SUSPENSION OF THE RECOVERY OF FINES , IN THE EVENT OF AN APPEAL BY THE UNDERTAKING IN QUESTION , JUSTIFY ITS NEW APPROACH . ACCORDINGLY , SAVE IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES , SUSPENSION OF ENFORCEMENT MUST BE MADE CONDITIONAL ON THE PROVISION OF A GUARANTEE .   THE INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE APPLICANT WITH REGARD TO ITS SITUATION , REGARD BEING HAD TO THE GROUP OF UNDERTAKINGS TO WHICH IT BELONGS , DOES NOT SHOW THAT THERE EXIST EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES IN THIS CASE SUCH AS TO JUSTIFY THE GRANTING OF A SUSPENSION WITHOUT THE PROVISION OF A GUARANTEE . IT IS , HOWEVER , PROPER TO GRANT THE APPLICANT A REASONABLE PERIOD WITHIN WHICH TO SATISFY THAT CONDITION .
