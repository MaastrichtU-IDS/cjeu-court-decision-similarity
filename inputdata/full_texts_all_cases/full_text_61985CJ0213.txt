THAT DOES NOT AFFECT THE COMMISSION' S RIGHT, IF NECESSARY, TO INITIATE NEW PROCEEDINGS UNDER ARTICLE WITH REGARD TO THE NEW TARIFF .  . WHERE, IN A DECISION REQUIRING A MEMBER STATE TO DISCONTINUE OR ALTER AN AID MEASURE, THE COMMISSION DOES NOT FIX THE PERIOD WITHIN WHICH THE AID MUST BE DISCONTINUED BUT SETS A DATE BY WHICH IT MUST BE INFORMED OF THE ACTION TAKEN IN THAT REGARD, THAT DATE CONSTITUTES THE TIME-LIMIT WITHIN WHICH THE DECISION MUST BE IMPLEMENTED .

Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JULY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION PURSUANT TO THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT BY FAILING TO COMPLY WITH COMMISSION DECISION 85/OF FEBRUARY ON THE PREFERENTIAL TARIFF CHARGED TO GLASSHOUSE GROWERS FOR NATURAL GAS IN THE NETHERLANDS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL 1985, L 97, P . ) THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS HAD FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY .  IN ARTICLE OF THAT DECISION THE COMMISSION STATED THAT "THE AID REPRESENTED BY THE PREFERENTIAL TARIFF FOR NATURAL GAS APPLIED IN THE NETHERLANDS IN RESPECT OF GLASSHOUSE GROWERS FROM OCTOBER IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE COMMON MARKET WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY AND MUST BE DISCONTINUED ". IN ARTICLE OF THE DECISION THE COMMISSION STATED THAT "THE NETHERLANDS SHALL INFORM THE COMMISSION BEFORE MARCH OF THE ACTION IT HAS TAKEN TO COMPLY WITH ARTICLE ".  THREE ACTIONS WERE BROUGHT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE TREATY FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THAT DECISION ( JOINED CASES 67, AND 70/85, VAN DER KOOY AND OTHERS V COMMISSION (( )) ECR ). IN THE COURSE OF THOSE CASES APPLICATIONS WERE MADE PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE TREATY FOR THE SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF THE DECISION; THOSE APPLICATIONS WERE DISMISSED BY AN ORDER OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF MAY . BY A JUDGMENT DELIVERED TODAY THE COURT HAS DISMISSED THOSE ACTIONS FOR ANNULMENT .  BY APPLICATIONS LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON AND NOVEMBER RESPECTIVELY, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND DENMARK APPLIED TO INTERVENE IN THIS CASE IN SUPPORT OF THE COMMISSION . BY ORDERS OF NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER THE COURT GRANTED THEM LEAVE TO INTERVENE .  REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING FOR A FULLER ACCOUNT OF THE FACTS OF THE CASE, THE COURSE OF THE PROCEDURE AND THE SUBMISSIONS AND ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES, WHICH ARE MENTIONED OR DISCUSSED HEREINAFTER ONLY IN SO FAR AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE REASONING OF THE COURT .  BEFORE CONSIDERING THE CLAIMS WHICH THE COMMISSION HAS FORMULATED AGAINST THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS IN THIS ACTION THE COURT MUST EMPHASIZE THAT THE ACTION WAS BROUGHT PURSUANT TO THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TREATY . THAT SUBPARAGRAPH PROVIDES THAT IF THE STATE CONCERNED DOES NOT COMPLY WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED TIME WITH A COMMISSION DECISION FINDING THAT AID GRANTED BY A STATE OR THROUGH STATE RESOURCES IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE COMMON MARKET HAVING REGARD TO ARTICLE 92, "THE COMMISSION OR ANY OTHER INTERESTED STATE MAY, IN DEROGATION FROM THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES AND 170, REFER THE MATTER TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE DIRECT ".  AS IS APPARENT FROM THE WORDING OF THAT PROVISION, IN PARTICULAR THE PHRASE "IN DEROGATION FROM THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES AND 170", AN ACTION OF THE KIND REFERRED TO CAN RELATE ONLY TO THE FAILURE BY THE MEMBER STATE CONCERNED TO COMPLY WITH A COMMISSION DECISION REQUIRING IT TO DISCONTINUE OR ALTER AN AID MEASURE ( SEE THE JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER IN CASE 156/COMMISSION V BELGIUM (( )) ECR ).  THE CONDUCT OF A MEMBER STATE AGAINST WHICH AN ACTION OF THIS KIND IS BROUGHT MUST THEREFORE BE ASSESSED SOLELY IN THE LIGHT OF THE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED ON IT BY THE COMMISSION DECISION .  THE FIRST CLAIM, CONCERNING THE DELAY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DECISION 85/IN ITS FIRST CLAIM THE COMMISSION COMPLAINS THAT THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT ALLOWED THE PREFERENTIAL GAS TARIFF FOR HORTICULTURAL PRODUCERS DECLARED INCOMPATIBLE WITH ARTICLE OF THE TREATY BY DECISION 85/TO REMAIN IN FORCE UNTIL THE FIRST WEEK OF JUNE .  ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSION, THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT WAS OBLIGED PURSUANT TO THAT DECISION TO DISCONTINUE THE AID IN QUESTION WITH EFFECT FROM FEBRUARY 1985, THE DATE ON WHICH THE DECISION WAS NOTIFIED TO IT AND BECAME BINDING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .  IN THE ALTERNATIVE, THE COMMISSION SUBMITS THAT DECISION 85/REQUIRED THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT TO DISCONTINUE THE AID IN QUESTION BEFORE MARCH 1985, THE DATE BY WHICH, PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE DECISION, IT WAS TO INFORM THE COMMISSION OF THE ACTION IT HAD TAKEN IN THAT RESPECT .  THE COMMISSION' S ARGUMENT TO THE EFFECT THAT DECISION 85/SHOULD HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED WITH EFFECT FROM THE DATE ON WHICH IT WAS NOTIFIED TO THE GOVERNMENT TO WHICH IT WAS ADDRESSED CANNOT BE UPHELD .  IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO CONSIDER THE QUESTION WHETHER, IN THIS CASE, THE COMMISSION HAD THE POWER PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) AND ( ) TO REQUIRE THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT TO DISCONTINUE THE TARIFF IN QUESTION IMMEDIATELY AND WITHOUT DELAY; IT NEED MERELY BE POINTED OUT THAT DECISION 85/CONTAINS NO SUCH OBLIGATION .  IN ARTICLE 1, NO MENTION IS MADE OF ANY PERIOD WITHIN WHICH THE TARIFF IN QUESTION MUST BE DISCONTINUED; HOWEVER, ARTICLE REQUIRES THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT TO INFORM THE COMMISSION "BEFORE MARCH 1985" OF THE ACTION TAKEN, AND THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT THEREFORE HAD UNTIL THAT DATE TO ADOPT THE NECESSARY MEASURES .  IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY ONLY TO EXAMINE THE COMMISSION' S ALTERNATIVE SUBMISSION .  IN ORDER TO REBUT THAT ARGUMENT THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT SUBMITS THAT DECISION 85/DID NOT OBLIGE IT TO DISCONTINUE THE AID WITHIN A SPECIFIC PERIOD AND THAT THE DATE OF MARCH WAS MERELY THE DATE BY WHICH CERTAIN INFORMATION WAS TO BE PROVIDED . FURTHERMORE, THAT TIME-LIMIT WAS EXTENDED BY THE COMMISSION IN ITS TELEX MESSAGE OF MAY 1985, FOLLOWING THE ORDER OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF MAY DISMISSING THE APPLICATION FOR SUSPENSION OF THE DECISION' S OPERATION, IN WHICH THE COMMISSION ASKED THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT TO INFORM IT "AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND AT THE LATEST WITHIN TWO WEEKS" OF THE MEASURES ACTUALLY TAKEN TO IMPLEMENT DECISION 85/.  THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS, MOREOVER, THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ILLOGICAL TO DISCONTINUE THE TARIFF IN QUESTION BEFORE A DETERMINATION HAD BEEN MADE ON THE APPLICATION SUBMITTED IN JOINED CASES 67, AND 70/FOR SUSPENSION OF THE DECISION' S OPERATION . IT POINTS OUT THAT FOLLOWING THE ORDER OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF MAY 1985, REFERRED TO ABOVE, A NEW TARIFF WAS ESTABLISHED BY A CONTRACT CONCLUDED ON JUNE . IN ITS VIEW, TECHNICAL AND LEGAL DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW TARIFF PREVENTED IT FROM TAKING ACTION SOONER .  THE ARGUMENTS OF THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT CANNOT BE UPHELD .  THE FACT THAT ARTICLE OF DECISION 85/FIXES THE DATE OF MARCH AS THE DATE BY WHICH THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT MUST INFORM THE COMMISSION OF THE ACTION TAKEN TO COMPLY WITH THE DECISION CLEARLY IMPLIES THAT THAT WAS ALSO THE DATE BY WHICH THAT GOVERNMENT WAS TO DISCONTINUE THE AID CONCERNED BY THE DECISION .  CONTRARY TO THE ARGUMENTS OF THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT, THE COMMISSION' S TELEX MESSAGE OF MAY DID NOT SET A NEW TIME-LIMIT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF DECISION 85/. IN THAT TELEX MESSAGE THE COMMISSION SIMPLY REQUESTED THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT TO INFORM IT "AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND WITHIN TWO WEEKS AT THE LATEST OF THE MEASURES ACTUALLY TAKEN IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE DECISION IN QUESTION BY THE DATE LAID DOWN ". THE REFERENCE TO THE "DATE LAID DOWN" SHOWS THAT THE COMMISSION DID NOT INTEND TO EXTEND THE TIME-LIMIT FOR IMPLEMENTATION SET IN ARTICLE OF THE DECISION .  AS FOR THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT' S ARGUMENT THAT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO WAIT UNTIL THE COURT HAD DEALT WITH THE THE APPLICATION FOR SUSPENSION OF THE DECISION' S OPERATION SUBMITTED IN JOINED CASES 67, AND 70/85, IT NEED MERELY BE POINTED OUT THAT ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF THE TREATY "ACTIONS BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT OF JUSTICE SHALL NOT HAVE SUSPENSORY EFFECT ". THE APPLICATION OF A MEASURE MAY BE SUSPENDED ONLY BY A DECISION OF THE COURT .  WITH REGARD TO THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT' S ARGUMENT CONCERNING THE LEGAL AND TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMMISSION' S DECISION, IT SHOULD BE RECALLED THAT IN ITS JUDGMENT OF JANUARY ( CASE 52/COMMISSION V BELGIUM (( )) ECR ), THE COURT HELD THAT IN AN ACTION OF THIS KIND A MEMBER STATE MAY "PLEAD THAT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE FOR IT TO IMPLEMENT THE DECISION (( OF THE COMMISSION )) PROPERLY ". IT MUST THEREFORE BE DETERMINED WHETHER, ON THE BASIS OF THE ARGUMENT PUT FORWARD BY THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT, IT MAY BE CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT DECISION 85/WITHIN THE TIME-LIMIT SET BY THE COMMISSION .  THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT SUBMITS THAT FROM THE TECHNICAL POINT OF VIEW IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPANY TO READ THE METERS IN EACH UNDERTAKING IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO INTRODUCE THE NEW TARIFF CORRECTLY . IT WAS ALSO, IT SAYS, NECESSARY FOR THE COMPANY TO INFORM EACH HORTICULTURAL PRODUCER IN WRITING IN ORDER TO AVOID THE RISK OF BEING HELD LIABLE FOR A UNILATERAL ALTERATION OF THE CONDITIONS OF THE SUPPLY CONTRACT, SINCE THESE CONDITIONS INCLUDED AN INDICATION OF THE TARIFF APPLICABLE .  IT NEED MERELY BE POINTED OUT THAT THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT HAS IN NO WAY SHOWN THAT THOSE STEPS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN TAKEN WITHIN THE TIME-LIMIT LAID DOWN IN THE DECISION IN QUESTION . MOREOVER, IT IS APPARENT FROM THE DOCUMENTS BEFORE THE COURT THAT AFTER THE DISMISSAL BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF THE APPLICATION FOR SUSPENSION OF THE DECISION' S OPERATION, THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT WAS ABLE TO ALTER THE DISPUTED TARIFF WITHIN A PERIOD COMPARABLE TO THAT GIVEN BY THE COMMISSION DECISION .  IT MUST THEREFORE BE CONCLUDED THAT BY ALLOWING GASUNIE TO APPLY THE PREFERENTIAL GAS TARIFF FOR HORTICULTURAL PRODUCERS WHICH WAS THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF COMMISSION DECISION 85/OF FEBRUARY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL 1985, L 97, P . ) UNTIL THE FIRST WEEK OF JUNE THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THAT DECISION AND UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TREATY .  THE SECOND CLAIM, CONCERNING THE INCOMPATIBILITY OF THE NEW TARIFF WITH ARTICLE OF THE TREATY  IN ITS SECOND CLAIM THE COMMISSION, SUPPORTED BY THE INTERVENERS, SUBMITS THAT THE TARIFF INTRODUCED BY THE AGREEMENT OF JUNE 1985, REFERRED TO ABOVE, REPLACING THE TARIFF HELD UNACCEPTABLE IN DECISION 85/215, ALSO CONTAINS AN ELEMENT OF AID WHICH MAKES IT INCOMPATIBLE WITH ARTICLE . IT FOLLOWS, SAYS THE COMMISSION, THAT THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS FAILED TO COMPLY WITH ARTICLE OF THE DECISION, WHICH REQUIRED IT TO DISCONTINUE THE AID TO HORTICULTURAL PRODUCERS IN THE FORM OF THE OLD TARIFF .  A SIGNIFICANT ASPECT OF THE NEW TARIFF IS THAT THE CEILING PRICE FOR GAS SUPPLIED TO HORTICULTURAL PRODUCERS IS CENTS/M3, WHEREAS IN THE OLD TARIFF THE CEILING PRICE WAS 42.CENTS/M.  IT MUST THEREFORE BE DETERMINED WHETHER, BY ADOPTING THAT TARIFF OR CAUSING IT TO BE ADOPTED, THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT COMPLIED WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE OF DECISION 85/.  IN THAT DECISION THE COMMISSION DID NOT INDICATE PRECISELY AT WHAT LEVEL THE TARIFF FOR HORTICULTURAL PRODUCERS SHOULD BE FIXED IN ORDER TO BE FREE OF ANY ELEMENT OF AID FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE 92; IT SIMPLY INDICATED A RANGE OF PRICES FROM 46.TO 47.CENTS/M3, DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF HOLDINGS, BUT RECOGNIZED THAT AT PRICES WITHIN THAT RANGE 30% OF THE GAS CONSUMED BY THE HORTICULTURAL SECTOR WOULD BE REPLACED BY COAL IN LESS THAN THREE YEARS .  IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY MORE PRECISE AND DETAILED INDICATIONS ON THE PART OF THE COMMISSION, THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT WAS ENTITLED TO CONSIDER THAT BY RAISING THE CEILING PRICE FOR HORTICULTURAL PRODUCERS TO CENTS/MIT PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED DECISION 85/.  IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE COMMISSION' S RIGHT, IF NECESSARY, TO INITIATE NEW PROCEEDINGS UNDER ARTICLE WITH REGARD TO THE NEW TARIFF, IT MUST BE CONCLUDED THAT THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS HAS NOT FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE OF DECISION 85/.  
Decision on costs
COSTS  UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS IF THEY HAVE BEEN ASKED FOR IN THE SUCCESSFUL PARTY' S PLEADINGS . HOWEVER, PURSUANT TO THE FIRST SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ), WHERE EACH PARTY SUCCEEDS ON SOME AND FAILS ON OTHER HEADS THE COURT MAY ORDER THAT THE PARTIES BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS IN WHOLE OR IN PART . WITH REGARD TO THE INTERVENERS, IT SHOULD BE OBSERVED THAT THEY MADE NO SUBMISSIONS ON THE ISSUE OF COSTS .  THE COMMISSION WAS SUCCESSFUL ONLY IN ITS FIRST CLAIM . THE PARTIES MUST THEREFORE BE ORDERED TO BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS,  THE COURT  HEREBY :  ( ) DECLARES THAT BY ALLOWING GASUNIE TO APPLY THE PREFERENTIAL GAS TARIFF FOR HORTICULTURAL PRODUCERS WHICH WAS THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF COMMISSION DECISION 85/OF FEBRUARY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL 1985, L 97, P . ) UNTIL THE FIRST WEEK OF JUNE THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THAT DECISION AND UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE EEC TREATY;  ( ) FOR THE REST, DISMISSES THE APPLICATION;  ( ) ORDERS THE PARTIES TO BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .
