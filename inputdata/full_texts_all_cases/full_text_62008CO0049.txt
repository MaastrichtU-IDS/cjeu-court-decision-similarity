Order of the Court (Fifth Chamber) of May – Raulin v France
(Case C‑49/08)
Action brought by a natural person against a Member State and seeking the annulment of a decision given by a national court
         and a declaration that the Member State concerned has infringed Community law – Clear lack of jurisdiction of the Court
      
1.                     Actions for annulment – Measures adopted by the national authorities – Lack of jurisdiction of the Court (Art. EC) (see
            paras 7-8)
2.                     Actions for failure to fulfil obligations – Right of action reserved to the Commission and the Member States – Action brought
            by a natural or legal person – Inadmissible (Arts EC and EC) (see paras 9-10)
Re: 
Actions for annulment – Infringement, by a Member State, of Council Directive 91/533/EEC of October on an employer’s
                  obligation to inform employees of the conditions applicable to the contract or employment relationship (OJ L 288, p.
                  32) – Clear lack of jurisdiction of the Court.
               
Operative part
1.
	The Court of Justice of the European Communities manifestly has no jurisdiction to adjudicate in the present case.
2.
	Ms Raulin is ordered to bear her own costs.
