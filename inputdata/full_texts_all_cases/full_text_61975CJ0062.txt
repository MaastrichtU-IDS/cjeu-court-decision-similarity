Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE LIST OF THE BEST QUALIFIED OFFICIALS PUBLISHED IN THE COMMUNICATIONS OF OCTOBER , THE APPEARANCE ON THIS LIST OF THE NAMES OF MR E . AND MR P . AND THEIR PROMOTION TO GRADE A , AND THE DEFENDANT ' S IMPLIED DECISION REJECTING THE REQUEST MADE BY THE APPLICANT ON DECEMBER , 
Grounds
IN AN APPLICATION LODGED ON JULY THE APPLICANT REQUESTED THE COURT TO ANNUL ( A ) THE LIST OF BEST QUALIFIED OFFICIALS PUBLISHED IN THE ' COMMUNICATIONS '  OF OCTOBER , ( B ) THE INCLUSION IN THIS LIST OF THE NAMES OF TWO OFFICIALS , MR E . AND MR P ., AND THEIR PROMOTION TO GRADE A AND ( C ) THE DEFENDANT ' S IMPLIED DECISION TO DISMISS THE APPLICANT ' S COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   IN THIS INSTANCE THE DEFENDANT FOLLOWED THE ' PRELIMINARY CONSULTATIVE PROCEDURE '  WHICH IT HAD ADOPTED BY A DECISION OF DECEMBER , PURSUANT TO WHICH FIVE PROMOTION COMMITTEES WERE SET UP FOR CATEGORIES A , B , C AND D AND THE LANGUAGE SERVICE , AND WERE GIVEN THE TASK ' OF EXAMINING THE POSITION OF OFFICIALS WHO SATISFY THE CONDITIONS LAID DOWN UNDER THE STAFF REGULATIONS FOR PROMOTION DURING A PARTICULAR FINANCIAL YEAR ' .   IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE TASK OF THE PROMOTION COMMITTEE FOR OFFICIALS IN CATEGORY A , THE COMMISSION ADOPTED ON JUNE A ' METHOD OF ASSESSMENT OF OFFICIALS IN GRADE A ELIGIBLE FOR PROMOTION TO GRADE A '  WHICH REQUIRES EACH DIRECTOR-GENERAL TO PUT FORWARD , IN ORDER OF PRIORITY , THE NAMES OF THE OFFICIALS IN GRADE A IN HIS DEPARTMENT WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR PROMOTION .   THESE PROMOTIONS PROPOSED ARE SUBMITTED TO THE PROMOTION COMMITTEE WHICH MAY MODIFY THEM ; IT AWARDS TO EACH OFFICIAL A CERTAIN NUMBER OF POINTS DETERMINED ON THE BASIS OF OBJECTIVE CRITERIA SUCH AS AGE , SENIORITY IN THE GRADE , SENIORITY IN THE SERVICE AND STAFF REPORTS ; ADDITIONAL POINTS ARE ALSO AWARDED TO A CERTAIN NUMBER OF OFFICIALS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR PROMOTION ON THE BASIS OF THEIR PLACE IN THE ORDER OF PRIORITY ESTABLISHED BY THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL CONCERNED . THE NUMBER OF OFFICIALS ELIGIBLE FOR THESE POINTS VARIES ACCORDING TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF OFFICIALS IN EACH DIRECTORATE-GENERAL WHOSE NAMES APPEAR ON THE LIST .   IN THIS INSTANCE , HAVING FOLLOWED THE PROCEDURE LAID DOWN BY THE ' METHOD OF ASSESSMENT '  THE NUMBER OF OFFICIALS ELIGIBLE FOR PROMOTION IN DIRECTORATE-GENERAL V WAS , WITH THE RESULT THAT ONLY THE FIRST FOUR LISTED WERE ABLE TO RECEIVE POINTS ON THE BASIS OF THEIR PRIORITY .   AS THE APPLICANT WAS CLASSIFIED IN SIXTH PLACE HE COULD NOT RECEIVE ANY POINTS ON THE BASIS OF HIS CLASSIFICATION .   HE MAINTAINS THAT AS A RESULT OF THE DISCRETIONARY AWARD OF ADDITIONAL POINTS THE CANDIDATES ELIGIBLE FOR PROMOTION WERE TREATED UNEQUALLY AND THAT THIS INFRINGED ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   HE POINTS OUT IN PARTICULAR THAT THE STAFF REPORT ON MR P ., ONE OF THE TWO CANDIDATES WHOSE NAMES THE APPLICANT WISHES TO SEE WITHDRAWN FROM THE LIST OF BEST QUALIFIED OFFICIALS , CONTAINS TWICE THE COMMENT ' ABOVE AVERAGE '  AND ONCE THE COMMENT ' AVERAGE '  UNDER THE HEADING ' EFFICIENCY '  WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT HEADING APPEARING ON THE FILE FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE METHOD OF EVALUATION APPLIED BY THE COMMISSION WHILST THE APPLICANT ' S REPORT CONTAINED THE COMMENT ' ABOVE AVERAGE '  UNDER EACH HEADING .   THE APPLICANT RECEIVED A HIGHER NUMBER OF POINTS THAN MR P . UNDER ANOTHER TWO OF THE FOUR OBJECTIVE CRITERIA , SENIORITY IN THE GRADE AND SENIORITY IN THE SERVICE .   THUS , IT WAS THE ASSESSMENT OF THE SUBJECTIVE FACTORS BY HIS DIRECTOR-GENERAL WHICH HAD ADVERSELY AFFECTED HIS POSITION , SINCE THE HEADING IN HIS REPORT ' CONDUCT IN THE SERVICE ' , WHICH WAS BY NATURE MORE OBJECTIVE , WAS MORE FAVOURABLE .   THE APPLICANT MAINTAINS THAT THE COMMISSION HAS ADOPTED A METHOD OF ASSESSMENT OF OFFICIALS ELIGIBLE FOR PROMOTION WHICH , ALTHOUGH PRESENTED AS ' OBJECTIVE ' , IN FACT LEAVES A VERY WIDE MARGIN OF CHOICE TO THE DIRECTORS-GENERAL AND PROMOTION COMMITTEES BY ALLOWING THE POINTS AWARDED ACCORDING TO OBJECTIVE CRITERIA AND THOSE AWARDED ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF PRIORITY OF THE OFFICIALS ON THE LISTS DRAWN UP BY THE DIRECTORS-GENERAL TO BE BALANCED ON AGAINST THE OTHER .   HE CRITICIZES IN PARTICULAR THE AWARD OF ADDITIONAL POINTS TO CANDIDATES E . AND P . ON THE BASIS OF THE ORDER OF PRIORITY ESTABLISHED BY THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF DIRECTORATE-GENERAL V .    WHEN THE LIST WAS DRAWN UP MR E . HAD ONLY THREE YEARS '  SENIORITY IN GRADE A AND ALTHOUGH MR P . HAD BEEN NINE YEARS IN THAT GRADE HE RECEIVED ONLY POINTS IN HIS REPORT AS COMPARED TO THE ( THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE ) OBTAINED BY THE APPLICANT .   HOWEVER , THE ORAL TESTIMONY OF MR S ., DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF DIRECTORATE-GENERAL V , SHOWS THAT MR E . WAS PLACED FIRST IN THE ORDER OF PRIORITY BY VIRTUE OF THE HIGH QUALITY OF HIS WORK .   THIS TESTIMONY ALSO SHOWS THAT MR P . WAS FIRST CLASSIFIED FIFTH IN THE ORDER OF PRIORITY AND THAT HIS CLASSIFICATION WAS SUBSEQUENTLY SO ALTERED AS TO PLACE HIM THIRD : THIS WAS DONE AT THE REQUEST OF THE STAFF COMMITTEE WHICH PUT FORWARD IN PARTICULAR THE VIEW THAT AS A GENERAL RULE , AN OFFICIAL IN GRADE A OUGHT TO BE PROMOTED TO A BEFORE HIS RETIREMENT AND THAT THEREFORE HIS AGE ( ) JUSTIFIED HIS PROMOTION .   IF THE APPLICANT HAD BEEN CLASSIFIED IN FIFTH PLACE INSTEAD OF MR P . IT DOES NOT SEEM LIKELY THE STAFF COMMITTEE WOULD HAVE INTERVENED TO PUT HIM IN THIRD PLACE , WHICH IT DID FOR MR P . ON THE BASIS OF HIS AGE .   EVEN IF IT BE OPEN TO QUESTION WHETHER THE COMMISSION DID NOT GIVE TOO MUCH WEIGHT TO THE ASSESSMENTS MADE BY THE DIRECTORS-GENERAL AS COMPARED TO THE OTHER FACTORS INVOLVED IN THE EVALUATION , THE COMMISSION HOWEVER HAS POWER UNDER THE STAFF REGULATIONS WHEN DECIDING ON PROMOTIONS TO MAKE A CHOICE ON THE BASIS OF A CONSIDERATION CARRIED OUT IN THE MANNER WHICH IT CONSIDERS TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE , OF THE COMPARATIVE MERITS OF THE CANDIDATES ELIGIBLE FOR PROMOTION AND OF THE REPORTS ON THEM .   IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT BY PROMOTING MR E . AND MR P . THE COMMISSION HAS EXCEEDED ITS POWERS .   FOR THIS REASON THE APPLICATION MUST BE DISMISSED .
