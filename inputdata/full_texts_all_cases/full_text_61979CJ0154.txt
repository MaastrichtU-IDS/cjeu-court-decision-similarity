Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON OCTOBER THE APPLICANTS , WHO ARE TWELVE OFFICIALS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND ONE FORMER MEMBER OF ITS TEMPORARY STAFF , BROUGHT AN ACTION SEEKING THE ANNULMENT OF THE DEFENDANT ' S DECISION REJECTING THE APPLICANTS '  COMPLAINTS PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS CONCERNING THE APPLICATION TO THEM OF COUNCIL REGULATIONS NO 3085/AND NO 3086/OF DECEMBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , PP . AND ).   IN THE VERSION IN FORCE UNTIL THE END OF , ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS PROVIDED THAT :    ' ' AN OFFICIAL ' S REMUNERATION SHALL BE EXPRESSED IN BELGIAN FRANCS .  IT SHALL BE PAID IN THE CURRENCY OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THE OFFICIAL PERFORMS HIS DUTIES .  REMUNERATION PAID IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN BELGIAN FRANCS SHALL BE CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF THE PAR VALUES ACCEPTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND . . . ON JANUARY .   AN OFFICIAL ' S REMUNERATION EXPRESSED IN BELGIAN FRANCS SHALL . . . BE WEIGHTED AT A RATE ABOVE , BELOW OR EQUAL TO 100% , DEPENDING ON LIVING CONDITIONS IN THE VARIOUS PLACES OF EMPLOYMENT .  THE WEIGHTING APPLICABLE TO THE REMUNERATION OF OFFICIALS EMPLOYED AT THE PROVISIONAL SEATS OF THE COMMUNITIES SHALL BE EQUAL TO 100% AS AT JANUARY ' ' .   ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS PROVIDES THAT :    ' ' THE PENSIONS ( OF FORMER OFFICIALS ) SHALL BE CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO SALARY SCALES IN FORCE ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE MONTH IN WHICH ENTITLEMENT COMMENCES .  THEY SHALL BE WEIGHTED IN THE MANNER PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE AND ARTICLE ( ) FOR THE COUNTRY OF THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THE PERSON ENTITLED TO THE PENSION DECLARES HIS HOME TO BE ' ' .   THE THIRD PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF ANNEX VIII ( PENSION SCHEME ) PROVIDES THAT :    ' ' BENEFICIARIES MAY ELECT TO HAVE THEIR PENSIONS PAID IN THE CURRENCY EITHER OF THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN OR OF THEIR COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE OR OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THE INSTITUTION TO WHICH THE OFFICIAL BELONGED HAS ITS SEAT : THEIR CHOICE SHALL REMAIN OPERATIVE FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS ' ' .       ON DECEMBER THE COUNCIL ADOPTED REGULATION ( EURATOM , ECSC , EEC ) NO 3085/( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), ARTICLE OF WHICH STATES THAT ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS IS REPLACED BY THE FOLLOWING :    ' ' OFFICIALS '  REMUNERATION SHALL BE EXPRESSED IN BELGIAN FRANCS . IT SHALL BE PAID IN THE CURRENCY OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THE OFFICIAL PERFORMS HIS DUTIES .  REMUNERATION PAID IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN BELGIAN FRANCS SHALL BE CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF THE EXCHANGE RATES USED FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GENERAL BUDGET OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ON JULY .   THIS DATE SHALL BE CHANGED , AT THE TIME OF THE ANNUAL REVIEW OF REMUNERATION PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE , BY THE COUNCIL ACTING BY A QUALIFIED MAJORITY UPON A PROPOSAL FROM THE COMMISSION AS PROVIDED IN THE FIRST INDENT OF THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLES ( ) OF THE EEC TREATY AND OF ( ) OF THE EURATOM TREATY .  WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLES AND , THE WEIGHTINGS FIXED PURSUANT TO THESE ARTICLES SHALL , WHENEVER THE ABOVE DATE IS CHANGED , BE ADJUSTED BY THE COUNCIL , WHICH , ACTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURE MENTIONED IN THE THIRD PARAGRAPH , SHALL CORRECT THE EFFECT OF THE VARIATION IN THE BELGIAN FRANC WITH RESPECT TO THE RATES REFERRED TO IN THE SECOND PARAGRAPH . ' '   ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF THE REGULATION IT WAS TO ENTER INTO FORCE ON JANUARY AND WAS TO APPLY FROM APRIL . HOWEVER , FOR PENSIONS AND ALLOWANCES OF WHICH THE NET AMOUNT BECAME LESS THAN THAT UNDER THE EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS , THE REGULATION WAS ONLY TO APPLY FROM OCTOBER . FROM THAT DATE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NET AMOUNTS RESULTING FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT REGULATION AND THOSE RECEIVED IN SEPTEMBER WAS TO BE REDUCED BY 1/PER MONTH .   ON DECEMBER THE COUNCIL ALSO ADOPTED REGULATION ( EURATOM , ECSC , EEC ) NO 3086/ADJUSTING THE WEIGHTINGS APPLICABLE TO THE REMUNERATION AND PENSIONS OF OFFICIALS AND OTHER SERVANTS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES FOLLOWING THE AMENDMENT OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE STAFF REGU    LATIONS CONCERNING THE MONETARY PARITIES TO BE USED IN IMPLEMENTING THE STAFF REGULATIONS . ARTICLE ( ) OF THE REGULATION FIXES INTER ALIA THE WEIGHTING APPLICABLE TO PENSIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AT 62.FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM .   IN MARCH THE APPLICANTS ( EXCEPT FOR MR CURTIS ), WHO ARE OFFICIALS IN THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE PARLIAMENT , SUBMITTED TO THE PARLIAMENT COMPLAINTS PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS WHICH WERE DIRECTED AGAINST COUNCIL REGULATION NO 3086/. THE APPLICANTS MAINTAINED THAT THE ALTERATION WHICH THAT REGULATION MADE TO THE WEIGHTING BROUGHT ABOUT A REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF THE PENSION WHICH THEY WOULD HAVE RECEIVED IF , ON RETIREMENT , THEY HAD CHOSEN TO RESIDE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THEY REQUESTED THAT THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY DECIDE THAT THE AMOUNT OF THEIR PENSION WOULD BE CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF ANNEX VIII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND EMPLOYING THE WEIGHTINGS APPLICABLE BEFORE THEIR AMENDMENT BY REGULATION NO 3086/. ON JUNE MR CURTIS , A FORMER MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF OF THE PARLIAMENT WHO IS NOW RETIRED AND RESIDENT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM , SUBMITTED A SIMILAR COMPLAINT TO THE PARLIAMENT .   IN JULY THE PARLIAMENT INFORMED THE APPLICANTS , APART FROM MR CURTIS , THAT THEIR COMPLAINTS WERE NOT ADMISSIBLE INASMUCH AS THEY WERE DIRECTED AGAINST A COUNCIL REGULATION THE APPLICATION OR NON-APPLICATION OF WHICH COULD NOT BE REGARDED AS FALLING WITHIN THE DISCRETIONARY POWERS OF THE PARLIAMENT .   IN THE ACTION WHICH THEY BROUGHT FOLLOWING THAT DECISION THE APPLICANTS CONTEND THAT REGULATIONS NO 3086/AND NO 3085/ARE UNLAWFUL ON A SERIES OF GROUNDS , NAMELY INFRINGEMENT OF AN ESSENTIAL PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENT , VIOLATION OF VESTED RIGHTS , INFRINGEMENT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE PROTECTION OF LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION , LACK OF COMPETENCE , INFRINGEMENT OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND MISUSE OF POWERS .   IN ADDITION TO DISPUTING THE SOUNDNESS OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE ACTION , THE PARLIAMENT HAS PUT FORWARD IN ITS DEFENCE AN OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY . IT IS APPROPRIATE FIRST TO CONSIDER THAT OBJECTION .   THE PARLIAMENT MAINTAINS THAT THE APPLICANTS '  COMPLAINTS DO NOT CONSTITUTE COMPLAINTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .     ACCORDING TO THE PARLIAMENT , BEFORE A COMPLAINT MAY BE MADE PURSUANT TO THAT ARTICLE IT IS NECESSARY THAT THERE BE AN ACT OF THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE OFFICIAL , THE ACT BEING EITHER A DECISION TAKEN BY THE AUTHORITY OR A FAILURE BY IT TO ADOPT A MEASURE PRESCRIBED BY THE STAFF REGULATIONS . IN THE PRESENT CASE THE PARLIAMENT HAS NOT TAKEN ANY DECISION RELATING TO THE APPLICANTS OR IN REGARD TO THEIR ENTITLEMENT TO PENSION . IT IS NOT OPEN TO THE PARLIAMENT TO TAKE A DECISION TO THE EFFECT SOUGHT BY THE APPLICANTS , THAT IS TO SAY , A DECISION NOT TO APPLY IN THEIR CASE THE REGULATIONS ADOPTED BY THE COUNCIL . THE PARLIAMENT HAS NOT FAILED TO ADOPT IN RELATION TO THE APPLICANTS ANY MEASURE PRESCRIBED BY THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   THE PARLIAMENT SUBMITS THAT ARTICLE OF THE TREATY , ON WHICH THE APPLICANTS RELY , DOES NOT IN FACT PROVIDE AN INDEPENDENT FORM OF ACTION BUT IS CONFINED TO DEALING WITH ISSUES OF LEGALITY WHICH ARE RAISED INCIDENTALLY , THAT IS TO SAY THOSE ARISING IN PROCEEDINGS WHICH HAVE THE LEGALITY OF OTHER ACTS AS THEIR PRINCIPAL SUBJECT-MATTER AND WHICH HAVE BEEN PROPERLY INSTITUTED .   IT IS FURTHER MAINTAINED THAT THE CASE-LAW OF THE COURT DEMONSTRATES THAT AN OFFICIAL MAY NOT AVAIL HIMSELF OF OTHER REMEDIES THAN THOSE PROVIDED FOR BY ARTICLE OF THE TREATY AND ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS IN ORDER TO BRING BEFORE THE COURT A QUESTION WHICH MUST BE SETTLED ACCORDING TO THE CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO OFFICIALS AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY THE JUDICIAL REMEDY PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF THE TREATY IS NOT OPEN TO HIM .   THE APPLICANTS SUBMIT THAT THE DECISION REQUESTED OF THE PARLIAMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A GENERAL DECISION NOT TO APPLY THE REGULATIONS BUT A DECISION NOT TO APPLY THEM TO A LIMITED GROUP OF PERSONS . THE APPLICANTS MAINTAIN THAT , PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE TREATY , THEY ARE ENTITLED TO BRING BEFORE THE COURT THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THE REGULATIONS , ON A PROPER CONSTRUCTION , ARE APPLICABLE TO THEM AND TO RELY ON ARTICLE OF THE TREATY IN THOSE PROCEEDINGS .   THE ARGUMENT ADVANCED BY THE PARLIAMENT MUST BE UPHELD . THE REGULATIONS IN QUESTION ARE OF GENERAL APPLICATION AND THE APPLICANTS MAY NOT CLAIM THAT THEY CONSTITUTE DECISIONS WHICH ARE OF DIRECT AND INDIVIDUAL CONCERN TO THEM IN ORDER TO CALL THEIR VALIDITY IN QUESTION IN PROCEEDINGS UNDER ARTICLE OF THE TREATY . THE MERE SUBMISSION OF A COMPLAINT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO CREATE A JUDICIAL REMEDY     AGAINST A MEASURE WHICH IS IN THE NATURE OF A REGULATION . MOREOVER , THE PROCEDURE PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE ( ) APPLIES ONLY WHERE THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY HAS TAKEN A DECISION OR HAS REFRAINED FROM ADOPTING A MEASURE PRESCRIBED BY THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND WHERE SUCH CONDUCT BY THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY CONSTITUTES AN ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE OFFICIAL . THAT HAS NOT OCCURRED IN THE PRESENT CASE . CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR THE APPLICANTS '  COMPLAINTS TO BE BASED ON ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS . THE ACTION IS THEREFORE INADMISSIBLE AND MUST BE DISMISSED WITHOUT ITS BEING NECESSARY TO CONSIDER THE SUBSTANCE .
