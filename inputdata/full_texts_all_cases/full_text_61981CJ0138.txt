Summary
. THE INTERIM FISHERIES REGIME ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMUNITY PENDING THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE AGREEMENT ON FISHERIES BETWEEN THE EEC AND SPAIN FALLS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE RELATIONS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND SPAIN IN  ORDER TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THE CONSERVATION MEASURES AND THE EXTENSION OF FISHERY ZONES AND IN ORDER TO ENSURE RECIPROCAL ACCESS BY FISHERMEN TO THE WATERS SUBJECT TO SUCH MEASURES . THOSE RELATIONS , WHICH WERE CONFIRMED BY THE AGREEMENT ON      FISHERIES OF , REPLACED THE PRIOR INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS EXISTING BETWEEN CERTAIN MEMBER STATES AND SPAIN IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THE INCREASINGLY URGENT NEED TO CONSERVE THE LIVING RESOURCES OF THE SEA AND TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE GENERAL EVOLUTION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW IN THE FIELD OF SEA FISHING .

Subject of the case
ON THE VALIDITY OF REGULATIONS OF THE COUNCIL LAYING DOWN CERTAIN TEMPORARY MEASURES FOR THE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF FISHERY RESOURCES APPLICABLE TO VESSELS FLYING THE FLAG OF SPAIN , 
Grounds
BY JUDGMENTS OF APRIL , WHICH WERE RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON JUNE , THE TRIBUNAL DE GRANDE INSTANCE ( REGIONAL COURT ), BAYONNE , REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER , HAVING REGARD TO PRIOR INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS , REGULATIONS OF THE COMMUNITIES LAYING DOWN CERTAIN INTERIM MEASURES FOR THE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF FISHERY RESOURCES APPLICABLE TO VESSELS FLYING THE FLAG OF SPAIN ARE VALID , IN SO FAR AS THEY LAY DOWN NEW DETAILED RULES FOR FISHING OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT BY SPANISH VESSELS IN THE RESERVED FISHING ZONE FROM TO NAUTICAL MILES , AND WHETHER , IF VALID , THOSE REGULATIONS ARE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST SPANISH NATIONALS .   THE QUESTION WAS RAISED IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE MASTERS OF TWO FISHING VESSELS REGISTERED IN SPAIN , WHO WERE CHARGED WITH FISHING IN FRENCH TERRITORIAL WATERS WITHOUT BEING IN POSSESSION OF A FISHING LICENCE AND WITH NETS WHOSE MESH-SIZE DID NOT COMPLY WITH THE REGULATIONS .       THE TWO DEFENDANTS IN THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS WERE DISCOVERED FISHING ON AND FEBRUARY RESPECTIVELY OFF BAYONNE IN THE WATERS IN THE AREA BETWEEN AND MILES FROM THE BASELINES , SOME MILES FROM THE FRENCH COAST .   THE NATIONAL COURT CONSIDERED THAT THE DEFENDANTS WERE UNABLE TO PRODUCE THE LICENCE REQUIRED BY COUNCIL REGULATIONS NO 1719/, NO 3305/AND NO 554/AND THAT IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THE FISHING IN WHICH THE DEFENDANTS HAD ENGAGED CONSTITUTED AN OFFENCE CREATED AND PUNISHED BY FRENCH CRIMINAL LEGISLATION . IT WAS ALSO CONSIDERED THAT THE DEFENDATS HAD COMMITTED AN OFFENCE CREATED AND PUNISHED BY THAT LEGISLATION BY FISHING WITH NETS WHOSE MESH-SIZE DID NOT COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF COUNCIL REGULATIONS NO 2527/AND NO 272/.    IN BOTH CASES THE DEFENDANTS IN THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS MAINTAIN THAT THE COMMUNITY REGULATIONS ARE INVALID OR IN ANY EVENT INAPPLICABLE AS AGAINST THEM , BEING INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE RIGHTS UPON WHICH THEY MAY RELY IN CONSEQUENCE OF INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS PREVIOUSLY ENTERED INTO BETWEEN FRANCE AND SPAIN . FOR THAT PURPOSE THEY RELY IN PARTICULAR UPON THE LONDON FISHERIES CONVENTION OF MARCH ( UNITED NATIONS TREATY SERIES , VOL . , NO ) AND UPON THE AGREEMENT ON FISHERIES BETWEEN FRANCE AND SPAIN OF ( JOURNAL OFFICIEL DE LA REPUBLIQUE FRANCAISE OF AUGUST , P . ).   COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1719/OF JUNE LAYING DOWN FOR CERTAIN MEASURES FOR THE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF FISHERY RESOURCES APPLICABLE TO VESSELS FLYING THE FLAG OF SPAIN ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ) WAS , ACCORDING TO THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE THEREOF , APPLICABLE FROM JANUARY TO DECEMBER . COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 3305/OF DECEMBER EXTENDING THE PERIOD OF VALIDITY OF FISHING LICENCES FOR VESSELS FLYING THE FLAG OF SPAIN ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ) PROVIDES THAT FISHING LICENCES VALID ON DECEMBER IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATION NO 1719/REMAIN VALID UNTIL JANUARY . COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 554/OF FEBRUARY FIXING CERTAIN INTERIM MEASURES FOR THE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF FISHERIES RESOURCES APPLICABLE TO VESSELS FLYING THE FLAG OF SPAIN ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ), WHICH ENTERED INTO FORCE ON MARCH , PROVIDES IN THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE THEREOF , THAT IT IS APPLICABLE UNTIL MAY .        THE THREE REGULATIONS CITED ABOVE FORM PART OF A SERIES OF COUNCIL REGULATIONS WHICH , PENDING THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE AGREEMENT ON FISHERIES BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY AND THE GOVERNMENT OF SPAIN OF APRIL ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ), ESTABLISHED FOR SHORT PERIODS INTERIM PROVISIONS PRESCRIBING CATCH QUOTAS FOR SPANISH FISHERMEN .   THE COURT HAS ALREADY STATED IN ITS JUDGMENT OF DECEMBER ( ARBELAIZ-EMAZABEL ) CASE 181/, ( ) ECR ) THAT THE INTERIM REGIME ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMUNITY FALLS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE RELATIONS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND SPAIN IN ORDER TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THE CONSERVATION MEASURES AND THE EXTENSION OF FISHERY ZONES AND IN ORDER TO ENSURE RECIPROCAL ACCESS BY FISHERMEN TO THE WATERS SUBJECT TO SUCH MEASURES AND THAT THOSE RELATIONS , WHICH WERE CONFIRMED BY THE AGREEMENT ON FISHERIES OF , REPLACED THE PRIOR INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS EXISTING BETWEEN CERTAIN MEMBER STATES AND SPAIN IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THE INCREASINGLY URGENT NEED TO CONSERVE THE LIVING RESOURCES OF THE SEA AND TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE GENERAL EVOLUTION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW IN THE FIELD OF SEA FISHING .   ACCORDINGLY , SPANISH FISHERMEN MAY NOT RELY ON PRIOR INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS AS BETWEEN FRANCE AND SPAIN IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE APPLICATION OF THE INTERIM REGULATIONS ADOPTED BY THE COMMUNITY IN THE EVENT OF ANY INCOMPATIBILITY BETWEEN THE TWO CATEGORIES OF PROVISIONS .   CONSIDERATION OF THE QUESTION RAISED HAS THUS DISCLOSED NO FACTOR OF SUCH A KIND AS TO AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF REGULATIONS NO 1719/, NO 3305/AND NO 554/. THOSE REGULATIONS ARE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST SPANISH NATIONALS .   THE DEFENDANTS IN THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS , THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT , THE COUNCIL AND THE COMMISSION HAVE DRAWN THE ATTENTION OF THE COURT TO THE FACT THAT AT THE MATERIAL TIMES IN THE TWO CASES NAMELY AND FEBRUARY , NO COMMUNITY REGULATION CONCERNING THE SYSTEM OF LICENCES WAS APPLICABLE TO VESSELS FLYING THE FLAG OF SPAIN . THE RECITALS IN THE PREAMBLE TO     REGULATION NO 554/STATE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE CONSULTATIONS BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND SPAIN WHICH ARE PROVIDED FOR BY THE AGREEMENT ON FISHERIES OF , WHICH WAS PROVISIONALLY APPLIED FROM THE DATE OF SIGNATURE , WERE NOT CONCLUDED UNTIL FEBRUARY , THAT FISHING BY SPANISH VESSELS IN THE FISHING ZONES OF MEMBER STATES WHICH WERE SUBJECT TO COMMUNITY FISHERIES REGULATIONS WAS AUTHORIZED DURING THE PERIOD FROM TO JANUARY BY REGULATION NO 3305/AND THAT SUCH FISHING HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED SINCE FEBRUARY .    THE DEFENDANTS IN THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS HAVE CLAIMED THAT UNDER THE AGREEMENT ON FISHERIES SPANISH FISHERMEN WERE ENTITLED TO FISH IN THE FISHING ZONES IN QUESTION DURING THE PERIODS WHEN NO COMMUNITY REGULATION ESTABLISHED A SYSTEM OF LICENCES FOR THEM .   IT IS NEVERTHELESS FOR THE NATIONAL COURT TO CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE ABSENCE OF ANY COMMUNITY REGULATIONS CONCERNING FISHING LICENCES APPLICABLE TO SPANISH FISHING VESSELS DURING THE PERIOD FROM FEBRUARY TO MARCH .    THE COMMUNITY RULES ON THE MESH-SIZE OF NETS ARE THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2527/OF SEPTEMBER LAYING DOWN TECHNICAL MEASURES FOR THE CONSERVATION OF FISHERY RESOURCES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ) THE APPLICATION OF WHICH WAS EXTENDED UNTIL FEBRUARY BY COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 272/JANUARY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L P . ).   THE VALIDITY OF THOSE REGULATIONS , WHICH APPLY WITHOUT DISTINCTION TO ALL PERSONS FISHING IN CERTAIN MARITIME WATERS UNDER THE SOVEREIGNTY OR JURISDICTION OF THE MEMBER STATES , HAS NOT BEEN CONTESTED BY THE PARTIES TO THE PROCEEDINGS AND THE COURT HAS NOT FOUND ANY FACTOR OF SUCH A KIND AS TO AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF THOSE REGULATIONS .
