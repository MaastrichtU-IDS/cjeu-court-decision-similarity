Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION DATED NOVEMBER NTN TOYO BEARING CO . LTD SOUGHT AN ORDER SUSPENDING THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLES AND OF COUNCIL REGULATION NO 2089/OF JULY IMPOSING A DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING DUTY ON IMPORTS OF CERTAIN BALL-BEARINGS ORIGINATING IN JAPAN UND SINGAPORE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) UNTIL THE DELIVERY OF THE FINAL JUDGMENT IN CASE 240/( NTN V COUNCIL ).   THAT APPLICATION , WHICH WAS LODGED AT THE REGISTRY OF THE COURT ON NOVEMBER , WAS BROUGHT UNDER ARTICLES AND OF THE EEC TREATY AND ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE .       THE APPLICANT REFERS TO ITS APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF ARTICLES AND OF THE AFORESAID REGULATION NO 2089/, WHICH APPLICATION IT LODGED AT THE REGISTRY OF THE COURT ON OCTOBER .    UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COURT , APPLICATIONS FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES MUST STATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO URGENCY AND THE FACTUAL AND LEGAL GROUNDS ESTABLISHING A PRIMA FACIE CASE FOR THE INTERIM MEASURES APPLIED FOR .   IN THIS REGARD , THE APPLICANT HAS MERELY STATED THAT THE IMMEDIATE PAYMENT OF THE ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES WILL IMPOSE ON IT FINANCIAL BURDENS WHICH WOULD BE UNNECESSARY IF IT SUCCEEDED IN THE MAIN ACTION . IT SUBMITS THAT THE INTERESTS OF THE COMMUNITY WOULD BE FULLY PROTECTED BY THE SECURITY WHICH IT HAS PROVIDED REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UP TO THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE BY IT UNDER ARTICLES AND OF THE AFORESAID REGULATION . IT ALSO CITED THE ORDER OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF OCTOBER IN CASE 113/R AND 113/R INT . ( NTN TOYO BEARING CO . LTD V COUNCIL , ( ) ECR ), STATING THAT IT HAD MADE DEPOSITS OF SECURITY IN THE AMOUNT OF THE ANTI-DUMPING DUTY AND THAT THE DEPOSITS WOULD BE MAINTAINED IN FORCE UNTIL THE DELIVERY OF THE JUDGMENT .   IT MUST BE NOTED THAT ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE , WHICH PROVIDES THAT THE ENFORCEMENT OF AN INTERLOCUTORY ORDER MAY BE MADE CONDITIONAL ON THE LODGING BY THE APPLICANT OF SECURITY , OF AN AMOUNT AND NATURE TO BE FIXED IN THE LIGHT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES , DOES NOT MEAN THAT A PERSON WHO APPLIES FOR THE SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF A MEASURE IS DISPENSED FROM THE NEED TO COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE .   IT IS APPARENT THAT THE APPLICANT HAS FAILED TO SATISFY THE CONDITIONS LAID DOWN IN THE LAST-MENTIONED PROVISION , SINCE THE APPLICATION STATES NEITHER THE CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO URGENCY NOR THE FACTUAL AND LEGAL GROUNDS CAPABLE OF JUSTIFYING THE SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF THE AFORESAID COUNCIL REGULATION . THE APPLICATION MUST THEREFORE BE DECLARED INADMISSIBLE .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , BY WAY OF AN INTERLOCUTORY RULING ,   THE PRESIDENT  ORDERS :   THE APPLICATION FOR INTERIM MEASURES IS DISMISSED .
