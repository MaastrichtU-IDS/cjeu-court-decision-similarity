BOSCO AND R . JOLIET, JUDGES,  ADVOCATE GENERAL : J.*L . DA CRUZ VILACA  REGISTRAR : H.*A . RUEHL, PRINCIPAL ADMINISTRATOR  HAVING REGARD TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING AND FURTHER TO THE HEARING ON JANUARY 1987,  HAVING REGARD TO THE OPINION OF THE ADVOCATE GENERAL DELIVERED AT THE SITTING ON MAY 1987,  DELIVERS THE FOLLOWING  JUDGMENT  
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON NOVEMBER MARCO CASTAGNOLI, A FORMER MEMBER OF THE COMMISSION' S AUXILIARY STAFF, SEEKS DECLARATIONS THAT THE MEASURE WHEREBY THE COMMISSION TERMINATED HIS CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT IS UNLAWFUL AND THAT HE SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AS A MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF . HE ALSO ASKS THE COURT TO ORDER THE COMMISSION TO COMPENSATE HIM FOR THE DAMAGE HE HAS SUFFERED .  REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING FOR AN ACCOUNT OF THE FACTS OF THE CASE, THE COURSE OF THE PROCEDURE AND THE SUBMISSIONS AND ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES, WHICH ARE MENTIONED OR DISCUSSED HEREINAFTER ONLY IN SO FAR AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE REASONING OF THE COURT .  BY A CONTRACT SIGNED ON FEBRUARY 1984, MR CASTAGNOLI WAS ENGAGED AS A MEMBER OF THE AUXILIARY STAFF TO OCCUPY A POST AS AN UNSKILLED WORKER AT THE JOINT RESEARCH CENTRE AT ISPRA . THE CONTRACT WAS FOR FOUR MONTHS AND IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY EXTENDED TO OCTOBER AND THEN TO FEBRUARY .  BY LETTER OF JANUARY MR HAMAERT, HEAD OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND PERSONNEL DIVISION OF THE COMMISSION, INFORMED MR CASTAGNOLI THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE OF THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OTHER SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES, HIS CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT COULD NOT BE RENEWED AFTER FEBRUARY .  ON RECEIVING THAT INFORMATION MR CASTAGNOLI SENT THE COMMISSION A LETTER DATED FEBRUARY STATING THAT HE HAD BEEN RECENTLY INFORMED THAT HE HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN ENGAGED IN ORDER TO REPLACE A MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF WHO HAD BEEN PLACED ON RETIREMENT ON GROUNDS OF INVALIDITY FROM JANUARY AND WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN REPLACED BY TWO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE AUXILIARY STAFF, EACH ENGAGED FOR A PERIOD OF MONTHS . HE MAINTAINED THAT RECRUITING AUXILIARY STAFF TO FILL A POST LEFT VACANT BY A MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF WAS A BREACH NOT ONLY OF ITALIAN LEGISLATION GOVERNING FIXED-TERM EMPLOYMENT BUT ALSO OF ARTICLES 3, AND OF THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OTHER SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES . HE THEREFORE CHALLENGED THE COMMISSION' S CLASSIFICATION OF HIM AND REQUESTED THAT HE BE RECOGNIZED AS A MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF ENGAGED FOR AN UNLIMITED PERIOD .  BY A DECISION OF JULY THE COMMISSION, AFTER DESCRIBING MR CASTAGNOLI' S LETTER AS A COMPLAINT WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS, REJECTED THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE LETTER . IT TOOK THE VIEW THAT MR CASTAGNOLI HAD BEEN ENGAGED AS A MEMBER OF THE AUXILIARY STAFF PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( B ) OF THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OTHER SERVANTS AND THAT THEREFORE HIS TERM OF EMPLOYMENT COULD NOT EXCEED ONE YEAR .  MR CASTAGNOLI BROUGHT THIS APPLICATION IN ORDER TO CHALLENGE THE REJECTION OF HIS COMPLAINT .  ADMISSIBILITY  THE COMMISSION SUBMITS THAT THE APPLICATION IS INADMISSIBLE . IT CLAIMS THAT THE ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING MR CASTAGNOLI WAS THE INITIAL CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT OR THE SUCCESSIVE EXTENSIONS THEREOF . THE LAST OF THOSE EXTENSIONS WAS NOTIFIED TO MR CASTAGNOLI ON OCTOBER . CONSEQUENTLY, HIS COMPLAINT HAD NOT BEEN BROUGHT WITHIN THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  MR CASTAGNOLI CHALLENGES THE OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY RAISED BY THE COMMISSION . HE MAINTAINS THAT THE ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING HIM WAS THE COMMISSION' S LETTER OF JANUARY INFORMING HIM THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO RENEW HIS CONTRACT AGAIN . CONSEQUENTLY, HIS COMPLAINT HAD BEEN LODGED IN DUE TIME .  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE MAIN PURPOSE OF MR CASTAGNOLI' S COMPLAINT WAS TO CHALLENGE HIS RECRUITMENT AS A MEMBER OF THE AUXILIARY STAFF . HOWEVER, THAT DESCRIPTION OF HIS STATUS HAD BEEN EXPRESSLY AGREED UPON IN THE INITIAL CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT .  THAT DESCRIPTION WAS NEVER ALTERED, EITHER IN THE SUCCESSIVE RENEWALS OF HIS CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT OR IN THE LETTER OF JANUARY 1985, IN WHICH THE COMMISSION MERELY COMMUNICATED TO HIM THE DATE ON WHICH HIS EMPLOYMENT WAS FINALLY TO CEASE . IT MUST THEREFORE BE CONCLUDED THAT THE ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING MR CASTAGNOLI WAS THE CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT SIGNED ON FEBRUARY .  SINCE MR CASTAGNOLI DID NOT LODGE HIS COMPLAINT WITH THE COMMISSION UNTIL FEBRUARY 1985, THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD LAID DOWN BY ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS WAS NOT COMPLIED WITH .  THE APPLICATION IS THEREFORE INADMISSIBLE .
