Re:
Requests for a preliminary ruling — Tribunalul Sibiu and Curtea de Apel Bucureşti — Tax on pollutant emissions levied on motor vehicles on their first registration or when a right of ownership is first recorded — Exemption for motor vehicles subject to earlier taxes — Possibility of recovering through the courts the taxes to which those vehicles have been subject — Suspension of payment of tax on vehicles which are already on the national market – Possible discouragement of the putting into circulation of second-hand vehicles purchased in other Member States — Compatibility of the national legislation with Article TFEU.
Operative part
Article TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a system of taxation, such as that introduced and then delimited by the national legislation at issue in the disputes in the main proceedings, by which a Member State levies a pollution tax on motor vehicles which is structured in such a way as to discourage the putting into circulation in that Member State of second-hand vehicles purchased in other Member States, but without discouraging the purchase of second-hand vehicles of the same age and condition on the domestic market.
