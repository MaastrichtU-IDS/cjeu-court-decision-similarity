Article 104(3), first subparagraph, of the Rules of Procedure – Domestic taxation – Article TFEU – Pollution tax levied at the time of registration of motor vehicles
Tax provisions – Internal taxation – Pollution tax levied on motor vehicles on their first registration in national territory – Tax applicable to imported second-hand vehicles and without any equivalent for vehicles of the same age and the same condition

Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Curtea de Apel Craiova – Registration of second-hand cars previously registered in other
                  Member States – Environmental tax levied on motor vehicles at the time of their first registration in a given Member State
                  – Compatibility of the national legislation with Art. TFEU – Temporary exemption for vehicles with certain characteristics.
               
Operative part
Article TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a Member State from introducing a pollution tax levied on motor vehicles
         on their first registration in that Member State if that tax is arranged in such a way as to discourage the putting into circulation
         in that Member State of second-hand vehicles purchased in other Member States without discouraging the purchase of second-hand
         vehicles of the same age and condition on the domestic market.
