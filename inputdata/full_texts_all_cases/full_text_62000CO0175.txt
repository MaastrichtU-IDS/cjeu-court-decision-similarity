Grounds
By judgment of May 2000, received at the Court on May 2000, the Arbeidshof te Antwerpen (Higher Labour Court, Antwerp) referred to the Court for a preliminary ruling under Article EC a question on the interpretation of Article 4(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/of June on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community, as amended and updated by Council Regulation (EC) No 118/of December (OJ L 28, p. 1, hereinafter Regulation No 1408/71).The question was raised in proceedings between Mrs Verwayen-Boelen and the Rijksdienst voor Arbeidsvoorziening (Department of Employment, hereinafter the RVA) concerning the RVA's refusal to take into consideration the period during which she had received benefits under Netherlands legislation in determining whether she may claim unemployment benefits under Belgian legislation.The Community legislationArticle of Regulation No 1408/provides as follows:1. This Regulation shall apply to all legislation concerning the following branches of social security:...(g) unemployment benefits;...4. This Regulation shall not apply to social ... assistance ...Article 67(1), (2) and (3) of Regulation No 1408/71, entitled Aggregation of periods of insurance or employment, which is in Chapter (Unemployment) of Title III, provides as follows:1. The competent institution of a Member State whose legislation makes the acquisition, retention or recovery of the right to benefits subject to the completion of periods of insurance shall take into account, to the extent necessary, periods of insurance or employment completed as an employed person under the legislation of any other Member State, as though they were periods of insurance completed under the legislation which it administers, provided, however, that the periods of employment would have been counted as periods of insurance had they been completed under that legislation.2. The competent institution of a Member State whose legislation makes the acquisition, retention or recovery of the right to benefits subject to the completion of periods of employment shall take into account, to the extent necessary, periods of insurance or employment completed as an employed person under the legislation of any other Member State, as though they were periods of employment completed under the legislation which it administers.3. Except in the cases referred to in Article 71(1)(a)(ii) and (b)(ii), application of the provisions of paragraphs and shall be subject to the condition that the person concerned should have completed lastly:- in the case of paragraph 1, periods of insurance,- in the case of paragraph 2, periods of employment,in accordance with the provisions of the legislation under which the benefits are claimed.Article 80(1) and (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 574/of the Council of March fixing the procedure for implementing Regulation No 1408/as amended and updated by Regulation No 118/(hereinafter Regulation No 574/72) provides as follows:Certified statement of periods of insurance or employment1. In order to invoke the provisions of Article 67(1), (2) or (4) of [Regulation No 1408/71], the claimant shall submit to the competent institution a certified statement specifying the periods of insurance or employment completed previously under the legislation to which he was last subject, together with any further information required by the legislation administered by that institution.2. This certified statement shall be issued, at the request of the person concerned, either by the institution competent in matters of unemployment of the Member State to whose legislation he was last subject, or by another institution designated by the competent authority of the said Member State. If he does not submit the said certified statement, the competent institution shall obtain it from one or other of the aforementioned institutions.The certified statement referred to in Article of Regulation No 574/(Form E 301) is issued following an application on a model form laid down in Decision No (94/605/EC) of the Administrative Commission of the European Communities on Social Security for Migrant Workers, of February 1994, on the model forms necessary for the application of Regulations No 1408/and No 574/(E 301, E 302, E 303) (OJ L 244, p. 123).The Belgian legislationIn Belgium, unemployment insurance is governed by the Royal Decree of November concerning rules on unemployment (Moniteur belge, December 1991, p. 29888). Article 30(1) of that decree provides as follows:To receive unemployment benefits, a full-time worker must complete a probationary period consisting of the number of working days set out below:1. during the first months preceding the claim for benefits, if he is under years of age;2. during the months preceding the claim, if he is between and years of age;3. during the months preceding the claim, if he is aged or above.A full-time worker who satisfies the condition laid down for a higher age category is also entitled to unemployment benefits....Article of the Royal Decree of November also provides that a full-time worker of at least years of age who does not fulfil the conditions laid down in Article 30(1) of that decree may nevertheless be eligible for unemployment benefits if he proves that he has completed half of the working days required by the latter provision during the reference period to which it refers and has completed working days during the 10-year period preceding that reference period.Article 38(1) of the Royal Decree of November provides:The following are treated as working days for the purposes of the application of Articles to 36:Days which have given rise to payment of an allowance under legislation relating to unemployment insurance;...The Netherlands legislationThe Rijksgroepsregeling werkloze werknemers (National block regulation for unemployed workers) of December (Staatsblad 1984, No 626, hereinafter the RWW) establishes a national aid scheme to combat unemployment and to ensure that recipients of benefits are economically independent. The scheme is intended for all persons who do not have or who no longer have an entitlement to benefits under the Werkloosheidswet (Law on unemployment) of November (Staatsblad No 566), or the Wet werkloosheidsvoorziening (Law on unemployment insurance) of December 1964, or the Wet inkomensvoorziening oudere en gedeeltelijk arbeidsongeschikte werkloze werknemers (Law guaranteeing an income for aged unemployed workers with partial incapacity) of November (Staatsblad No 565).The main proceedings and the national court's questionMrs Verwayen-Boelen, who was born in and has dual Belgian and Netherlands nationality, was resident in Belgium until 1987. She was self-employed there from October until October 1986.In she took up residence in the Netherlands. She received benefits there under the RWW between October and October and did not work there.When she returned to Belgium in November to take up residence there, Mrs Verwayen-Boelen lodged a claim, on July 1997, for unemployment benefits under the Royal Decree of November with effect from April 1997. She included with her application a Form E issued by the Netherlands authorities which indicated the period during which Mrs Verwayen-Boelen had received benefits under the RWW.Following a query by the RVA, the authority responsible for dealing with that application, the competent Netherlands authorities stated that the Form E had been issued in error and stated in that regard that the receipt of an RWW benefit does not imply any insurance obligations in the Netherlands and there can be no question of its being treated as equivalent.On the August 1997, the RVA rejected Mrs Verwayen-Boelen's claim on the grounds that she could not be considered to have completed, in the Netherlands, periods of insurance or periods treated as such for the purposes of Article of the Royal Decree of November and that she had not completed any working days or days treated as such in Belgium during the reference period.Mrs Verwayen-Boelen's action challenging the RVA's decision was dismissed by the Arbeidsrechtbank te Hasselt (Labour Court, Hasselt), Belgium, by judgment of June 1999, whereupon she appealed to the Arbeidshof te Antwerpen. She submits that she can rely on Article of Regulation No 1408/in order to have taken into account, under Belgian unemployment insurance, periods during which she received benefits under the RWW.The national court, analysing the RWW in the light of the case-law of the Court of Justice, is uncertain whether that legislation must be regarded as an unemployment benefits scheme for the purposes of Article 4(1)(g) of Regulation No 1408/and whether it therefore falls within the scope of application of that regulation. According to the national court, Mrs Verwayen-Boelen may rely on Article of Regulation 1408/only if the latter condition is fulfilled.In those circumstances, the Arbeidshof te Antwerpen decided to stay proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:Must Article 4(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, according to which that regulation applies to branches of social security, be interpreted as meaning that a scheme such as the RWW scheme, which has characteristics both of social security and of social assistance, falls within the scope of that regulation, so that the period during which an employed person receives benefits under that scheme can qualify as an insurance period which is to be taken into account when assessing whether that person can have entitlement to unemployment benefits in Belgium?In reply to a request from the Court of Justice for clarification under Article 104(5) of its Rules of Procedure, the national court stated that Mrs Verwayen-Boelen had not completed lastly periods of insurance and/or employment in accordance with the provisions of the Belgian legislation.The national court's questionIt is apparent from the judgment making the reference and from the wording of the national court's question that, although the national court is seeking to ascertain how the RWW is to be characterised in the light of Article 4(1) of Regulation No 1408/and whether the RWW may fall within the scope of application ratione materiae of that regulation, it is doing so in order to determine whether it is necessary to apply the rules on the aggregation of periods of insurance or employment laid down in Article of Regulation 1408/71.In those circumstances, it must be found that the reply to the national court leaves no room for reasonable doubt and it is therefore appropriate to give a decision by reasoned order in accordance with Article 104(3) of the Rules of Procedure.As is clear from the explanations provided by the national court, it is common ground that Mrs Verwayen-Boelen has not completed lastly either periods of insurance or periods of employment in accordance with the provisions of the Belgian legislation.It follows from the clear terms of Article 67(3) of Regulation No 1408/that, except in the cases expressly referred to in that provision, there can be no aggregation of periods of insurance or employment under Article 67(1) or (2) of that regulation where the person concerned has not completed lastly periods of insurance or of employment in accordance with the provisions of the legislation under which the benefits are claimed (see Joined Cases C-88/95, C-102/and C-103/Martinez Losada and Others [1997] ECR I-869, paragraphs and 38, and Case C-320/Ferreiro Alvite [1999] ECR I-951, paragraphs to 18).It must also be noted that the Court has previously held that, under Regulation No 1408/71, the taking into account by a Member State of periods of insurance or employment completed by the person concerned in accordance with the provisions of the legislation of another Member State for the purposes of the award of unemployment benefit is governed solely by Article of Regulation No 1408/(Martinez Losada and Others, paragraph 27).In those circumstances it therefore suffices to state that Article 67(1) and (2) of Regulation No 1408/is not applicable to a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings and that it is not necessary to ascertain whether the other conditions for the application of that provision, to which the national court's question refers more specifically, are fulfilled.Having regard to the considerations set out above, the answer to the national court's question must be that under Article 67(3) of Regulation No 1408/the application of the rules on the aggregation of periods of insurance or employment laid down in Article 67(1) and (2) is, except in the cases expressly referred to in Article 67(3), subject to the condition that the person concerned has completed lastly periods of insurance or employment in accordance with the provisions of the legislation under which the unemployment benefits are claimed. 
Decision on costs
CostsThe costs incurred by the Netherlands Government and by the Commission, which have submitted observations to the Court, are not recoverable. Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. 
Operative part
On those grounds,THE COURT (Fifth Chamber),hereby orders:Under Article 67(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/of the Council of June on the application to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community, as amended and updated by Council Regulation (EC) No 118/of December 1996, the application of the rules on the aggregation of periods of insurance or employment laid down in Article 67(1) and (2) is, except in the cases expressly referred to in Article 67(3), subject to the condition that the person concerned has completed lastly periods of insurance or employment in accordance with the provisions of the legislation under which the unemployment benefits are claimed.
