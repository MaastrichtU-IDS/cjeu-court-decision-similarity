APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY BY FAILING TO IMPLEMENT , WITHIN THE PERIODS PRESCRIBED , SEVEN DIRECTIVES ON MEASURING INSTRUMENTS , 
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON NOVEMBER , THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT , BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIODS THE PROVISIONS NEEDED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE FOLLOWING SERIES OF SEVEN DIRECTIVES ON MEASURING INSTRUMENTS , THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE THIRD PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY :     ( A ) COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 76/765/EEC OF JULY ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO ALCOHOLOMETERS AND ALCOHOL HYDROMETERS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . );   ( B)COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 76/766/EEC OF JULY ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO ALCOHOL TABLES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . );   ( C)COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 76/891/EEC OF NOVEMBER ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO ELECTRICAL ENERGY METERS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . );   ( D)COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 77/95/EEC OF DECEMBER ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO TAXIMETERS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . );   ( E)COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 77/313/EEC OF APRIL ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO MEASURING SYSTEMS FOR LIQUIDS OTHER THAN WATER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . );   ( F)COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 78/365/EEC OF MARCH ADAPTING TO TECHNICAL PROGRESS FOR THE SECOND TIME COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 71/318/EEC ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO GAS VOLUME METERS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . );   ( G)COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 78/629/EEC OF JUNE ADAPTING TO TECHNICAL PROGRESS DIRECTIVE 73/362/EEC ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO MATERIAL MEASURES OF LENGTH ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ).   EACH DIRECTIVE PROVIDED THAT THE MEMBER STATES WERE OBLIGED TO PUT INTO FORCE THE MEASURES NEEDED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH IT WITHIN A CERTAIN PERIOD WHICH VARIED BETWEEN AND MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF ITS NOTIFICATION . THE LAST OF THE PERIODS LAID DOWN EXPIRED ON JUNE .    THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DISPUTE THE FACT THAT IT HAS NOT FULFILLED THAT OBLIGATION . IT STATES THAT THE DELAY IN IMPLEMENTING THE DIRECTIVES ARISES FROM THE NEED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO LEGISLATION IN ORDER TO PUT THEM INTO EFFECT , NECESSITATING A PERIOD OF TIME WHICH IS DETERMINED BY REQUIREMENTS AND EVENTS PECULIAR TO THE PARLIAMENTARY PROCESS ; IN VIEW OF THOSE DIFFICULTIES THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS APPLIED TO PARLIAMENT FOR THE DELEGATION OF LEGISLATIVE POWERS , WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN APPROVED BY THE SENATE BUT IS STILL UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES .       THESE CIRCUMSTANCES DO NOT EXPUNGE THE FAILURE TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS WITH WHICH THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC IS CHARGED . ACCORDING TO WELL-ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW , A MEMBER STATE MAY NOT PLEAD PROVISIONS , PRACTICES OR CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING IN ITS INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OBLIGATIONS AND TIME-LIMITS RESULTING FROM COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES .   IT MUST THEREFORE BE HELD THAT BY FAILING TO ADOPT , WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIODS , THE PROVISIONS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE ABOVE-MENTIONED DIRECTIVES THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY .
