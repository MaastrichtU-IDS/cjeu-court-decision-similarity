Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF THE MEASURE SUSPENDING PAYMENT OF SALARY UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS, 
Grounds
BY HER APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF AN INTERIM ORDER, MISS PERINCIOLO ASKS THE COURT TO ORDER THAT THE OPERATION OF THE MEASURE SUSPENDING PAYMENT OF HER REMUNERATION WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THE MAIN ACTION SHOULD BE SUSPENDED .  THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES OBJECTS THAT THIS APPLICATION IS INADMISSIBLE SINCE THE DECISION AT ISSUE WAS CONTAINED IN A LETTER OF JUNE FROM THE DIRECTOR OF ADMINISTRATION OF THE SECRETARIAT GENERAL OF THE COUNCIL AND THAT NO COMPLAINT WAS MADE BETWEEN THAT DATE AND SEPTEMBER AS REQUIRED BY ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  IN ADDITION IT POINTS OUT THAT THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS ARE MANDATORY AND THAT THE CONDITIONS FOR THEIR APPLICATION ARE FULFILLED IN THIS CASE .  ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AS AMENDED BY THE COUNCIL ON JUNE ( OJ 1972, L ) PROVIDES THAT AN APPLICATION FOR A STAY OF EXECUTION OF A CONTESTED ACT MUST BE MADE CONCURRENTLY WITH THE MAIN ACTION BROUGHT AFTER SUBMISSION OF THE COMPLAINT REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  IN THIS CASE THE MAIN ACTION TO WHICH THE APPLICATION FOR A STAY OF EXECUTION IS JOINED IS DIRECTED NOT ONLY AGAINST THE DECISION CONTAINED IN THE LETTER OF JUNE FROM THE DIRECTOR OF ADMINISTRATION OF THE SECRETARIAT GENERAL OF THE COUNCIL BUT ALSO AGAINST THE DECISION CONTAINED IN THE LETTER OF JULY FROM THE SECRETARY GENERAL .  IN RESPECT OF THIS LATTER DECISION, THE COMPLAINT OF OCTOBER WAS MADE WITHIN THE PERIOD SET OUT IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  IN EXAMINING THE ADMISSIBILITY OF AN APPLICATION FOR A SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF A MEASURE, THE JUDGE IN THE INTERIM PROCEEDINGS MUST NOT PREJUDGE QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE MAIN ACTION WHICH ARE WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT HEARING THE MAIN ACTION .  SINCE THE APPLICATION FOR A STAY OF EXECUTION COMPLIES WITH THE CONDITIONS SET OUT IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS, IT IS ADMISSIBLE .  ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COURT PROVIDES THAT THE SUSPENSION OF OPERATION OF A MEASURE IS SUBJECT TO THE EXISTENCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO URGENCY AND GROUNDS ESTABLISHING A PRIMA FACIE CASE FOR THE INTERIM MEASURES APPLIED FOR .  THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS PROVIDES THAT THE PRINCIPAL REASON FOR FORFEITURE OF REMUNERATION IS THE ABSENCE OF AN OFFICIAL WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION UNDER THE REGULATIONS OR FROM THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY .  THE APPLICANT JUSTIFIES THE ABSENCES IN QUESTION BY STATING THAT SHE SUFFERED FROM AN INVALIDITY WHICH MADE HER UNFIT TO CARRY OUT THE TYPIST' S DUTIES INVOLVED IN THE POST TO WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ASSIGNED .  WHILST AN OFFICIAL IS ENTITLED TO SEEK RECOGNITION THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS OR IF NECESSARY BEFORE THE COURT OF THE INVALIDITY FROM WHICH HE CLAIMS TO SUFFER, THIS ALLEGED INVALIDITY DOES NOT CONSTITUTE SUFFICIENT GROUNDS FOR ABSENCE FROM WORK, EXCEPT IN CASES WHERE IT IS ACTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO ATTEND, WITHOUT THE AGREEMENT OF THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY .  THE WAY IN WHICH AN OFFICIAL FULFILS THE DUTIES ASSIGNED TO HIM MAY ON THE OTHER HAND CONSTITUTE EVIDENCE USEFUL TO THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY .  THEREFORE, SINCE THE APPLICANT HAS NOT ESTABLISHED THE EXISTENCE OF GROUNDS WHICH PRIMA FACIE JUSTIFY HER APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF AN INTERIM MEASURE THERE ARE NO GROUNDS FOR ORDERING THE SUSPENSION OF OPERATION OF THE MEASURE SUSPENDING PAYMENT OF HER REMUNERATION .  
Decision on costs
