Reference for a preliminary ruling – Bundesgerichtshof Karlsruhe – Interpretation of Article 5(1)(a) of First Council Directive
                  89/104/EEC of December to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks (OJ L 40, p. 1) –
                  Inscription of a sign similar to a trade mark with a service provider operating an internet search engine in order automatically
                  to have displayed on the screen, after entry of that sign as a search term, adverts for goods or services identical to those
                  for which the trade mark in question was registered (‘keyword advertising’) – No authorisation by the proprietor of the trade
                  mark – Classification of that use of the mark as ‘use’ within the meaning of the provision cited above.
               
Operative part: 
 
	Article 5(1)(a) of First Council Directive 89/104/EEC of December to approximate the laws of the Member States relating
                     to trade marks must be interpreted as meaning that the proprietor of a trade mark is entitled to prohibit an advertiser from
                     advertising, on the basis of a keyword identical to that trade mark which that advertiser has, without the consent of the
                     proprietor, selected in connection with an internet referencing service, goods or services identical to those for which that
                     mark is registered, when that advertisement does not enable an average internet user, or enables that user only with difficulty,
                     to ascertain whether the goods or services referred to therein originate from the proprietor of the trade mark or an undertaking
                     economically connected to it or, on the contrary, originate from a third party.
