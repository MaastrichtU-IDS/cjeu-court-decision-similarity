. AN OFFICIAL HAS NO LEGITIMATE INTEREST IN SECURING THE ANNULMENT OF A DECISION FOR A FORMAL DEFECT WHERE THE  ADMINISTRATION HAS NO DISCRETION AND IS BOUND TO ACT AS IT DID . IN SUCH A CASE THE ANNULMENT OF THE CONTESTED       DECISION COULD ONLY GIVE RISE TO ANOTHER DECISION SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL TO THE DECISION ANNULLED .  . OFFICIALS PAID FROM RESEARCH APPROPRIATIONS PURSUE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES SPECIALLY DEFINED BY THE COUNCIL . AN OFFICIAL PAID FROM RESEARCH APPROPRIATIONS CANNOT THEREFORE BE ASSIGNED TOGETHER WITH HIS BUDGETARY POST TO TASKS WHICH ARE NOT PART OF A RESEARCH PROGRAMME SINCE SUCH A PRACTICE WOULD BE IN BREACH OF DECISIONS TAKEN BY THE COUNCIL IN RELATION TO RESEARCH AND OF THE BUDGETARY RULES FOR ALLOCATION OF APPROPRIATIONS .  . THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN OFFICIALS OF THE SCIENTIFIC OR TECHNICAL STAFF PAID FROM APPROPRIATIONS IN THE RESEARCH AND INVESTMENT BUDGET AND OFFICIALS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE OR LANGUAGE STAFF PAID FROM OPERATIONAL APPROPRIATIONS FOLLOWS FROM THE VERY PROVISIONS OF TITLE VIII OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS WHICH INTRODUCES VARIOUS DIFFERENCES OF TREATMENT BETWEEN THOSE TWO CATEGORIES OF STAFF IN CONSIDERATION OF THE  SPECIAL FEATURES OF THEIR DUTIES . IT CANNOT THEREFORE BE MAINTAINED THAT A VACANCY NOTICE CREATES UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN OFFICIALS OF THE COMMISSION INASMUCH AS IT EXCLUDES FROM CONSIDERATION FOR THE VACANT POST OFFICIALS PAID FROM RESEARCH AND INVESTMENT APPROPRIATIONS , SINCE THE ADDITIONAL DIFFERENCE IS JUSTIFIED BY THE NEED TO ENSURE APPLICATION OF A COMMISSION DECISION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DECISIONS TAKEN BY THE COUNCIL IN RELATION TO RESEARCH AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BUDGETARY RULES FOR ALLOCATION OF APPROPRIATIONS .  . THE COMMISSION DECISION OF JULY SETTING UP A ROTATION SYSTEM FOR OFFICIALS ASSIGNED TO DELEGATIONS AND OFFICES IN NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES IS NOT A GENERAL PROVISION FOR GIVING EFFECT TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS AS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE OF THOSE REGULATIONS BUT FLOWS FROM THE GENERAL POWER WHICH EACH INSTITUTION HAS TO ORGANIZE ITS OWN DEPARTMENTS IN THE INTERESTS OF THEIR EFFICIENT WORKING .

Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT OF THE COMMISSION DECISION OF JULY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE APPLICANT ' S CANDIDATURE FOR POST NO COULD NOT BE ACCEPTED , OF THE DECISION CONTAINED IN VACANCY NOTICE NO TO RESERVE THE POST FOR OFFICIALS PAID FROM THE OPERATIONAL APPROPRIATIONS AND OF ALL THE DECISIONS TAKEN FOLLOWING THE PUBLICATION OF THAT NOTICE TO FILL POST NO , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON MAY MR GEIST , A SCIENTIFIC OFFICIAL ASSIGNED TO THE JOINT RESEARCH CENTRE AT ISPRA , BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION NOTIFIED TO HIM ON JULY TO THE EFFECT THAT HIS APPLICATION FOR POST NO AS FIRST SECRETARY RESPONSIBLE FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL MATTERS WITH THE COMMUNITIES '  DELEGATION IN WASHINGTON COULD NOT BE ACCEPTED ; OF THE DECISION CONTAINED IN VACANCY NOTICE NO TO RESERVE THE POST TO OFFICIALS PAID FROM OPERATIONAL APPROPRIATIONS AND OF ALL DECISIONS TAKEN PURSUANT TO THE PUBLICATION OF THE VACANCY NOTICE FOR THE PURPOSE OF FILLING POST NO .  THE APPLICANT TOOK UP DUTY ON APRIL AT THE JOINT RESEARCH CENTRE AT PETTEN ( THE NETHERLANDS ) AS THE HEAD OF HYDRAULIC STUDIES ; IN HE WAS APPOINTED HEAD OF THE HYDRODYNAMICS AND MEASUREMENTS DIVISION AND ON JANUARY WAS PROMOTED TO GRADE A AFTER A PERIOD OF SECONDMENT IN THE USA . AS A RESULT OF THE CHANGE DECIDED BY THE COUNCIL ON JUNE IN THE RESEARCH PROGRAMMES FOR WHICH MR GEIST PERFORMED WORK APPROPRIATE TO HIS SPECIALIST QUALIFICATIONS HE WAS FORCED TO DEVOTE HIMSELF TO NEW TASKS DEFINED BY THE INSTITUTION . AFTER THE NEW CHANGE IN THE RESEARCH PROGRAMMES DECIDED ON AUGUST BY THE COUNCIL IT WAS FOUND IMPOSSIBLE TO USE MR GEIST ' S CAPABILITIES AT THE JOINT RESEARCH CENTRE AT PETTEN AND THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF THE JOINT RESEARCH CENTRE THEREFORE DECIDED ON DECEMBER TO TRANSFER HIM AS FROM MARCH TO THE HEAT TRANSFER AND FLUID MECHANICS DIVISION OF THE JOINT RESEARCH CENTRE AT ISPRA .   THAT POST DID NOT SUIT MR GEIST AND HE BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION TO TRANSFER HIM , WHICH WAS DISMISSED BY JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF JULY ( CASE 61/( ) ECR ). MR GEIST THEN ASKED THE COMMISSION TO FIND HIM A POST OUTSIDE THE JOINT RESEARCH CENTRE AT ISPRA .   IN EXPECTATION OF A NEW ASSIGNMENT MR GEIST SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION FOR POST NO ADVERTISED IN A VACANCY NOTICE IN THE STAFF COURIER OF JUNE AND WORDED AS FOLLOWS :    ' ' POST NO - PURSUANT TO THE SYSTEM OF ROTATION ADOPTED FOR DELEGATIONS AND INFORMATION OFFICES , THE DIRECTORATE-GENERAL I , EXTERNAL RELATIONS , SEEKS FOR THE DELEGATION IN WASHINGTON : AN OFFICIAL OF GRADE A TO GRADE A , FIRST SECRETARY RESPONSIBLE FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL MATTERS . WIDE EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL PROBLEMS AND IN PARTICULAR IN THE FIELD OF ENERGY IS REQUIRED . . . APPLICATIONS ARE RESERVED TO OFFICIALS OF THE COMMISSION PAID OUT OF OPERATIONAL APPROPRIATIONS . ' '   IN A MEMORANDUM DATED JULY MR GEIST WAS INFORMED THAT HIS APPLICATION HAD BEEN REJECTED . ON OCTOBER HE MADE A COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS CLAIMING THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE DECISION NOTIFIED BY LETTER OF JULY , THE WITHDRAWAL , SO FAR AS NECESSARY , OF THE DECISION TO TRANSFER OR PROMOTE ANOTHER OFFICIAL AND FINALLY THE AMENDMENT OF THE TERMS OF VACANCY NOTICE NO WITH THE OBJECT OF MAKING THE VACANCY AVAILABLE ALSO TO OFFICIALS PAID FROM APPROPRIATIONS IN THE RESEARCH AND INVESTMENT BUDGET . WHEN BY IMPLICATION THE ADMINISTRATION REJECTED HIS COMPLAINT MR GEIST BROUGHT THE PRESENT ACTION .      THE FIRST TWO SUBMISSIONS   IN SUPPORT OF HIS APPLICATION THE APPLICANT FIRST OF ALL MAKES TWO SUBMISSIONS OF PATENT DEFECTS IN THE DECISION NOTIFIED ON JULY REJECTING HIS APPLICATION . HE CLAIMS ON THE ONE HAND THAT THE OFFICIAL WHO SIGNED THE MEMORANDUM OF JULY HAD NO POWER TO DO SO AND ON THE OTHER THAT THE GROUNDS ON WHICH THE DECISION WAS BASED WERE NOT STATED .   THE COURT FINDS THAT EVEN ASSUMING THAT THE CONTESTED DECISION IS VITIATED BY THE TWO BREACHES OF PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS ALLEGED , AN APPLICANT HAS NO LEGITIMATE INTEREST IN SECURING THE ANNULMENT OF A DECISION FOR A FORMAL DEFECT WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NO DISCRETION AND IS BOUND TO ACT IS IT DID . IN SUCH A CASE THE ANNULMENT OF THE CONTESTED DECISION COULD ONLY GIVE RISE TO ANOTHER DECISION SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL TO THE DECISION ANNULLED .   THE COMMISSION ALLEGES THAT SUCH IS THE CASE HERE . THE VACANCY NOTICE REQUIRED IT TO EXCLUDE MR GEIST ' S APPLICATION SINCE HE WAS NOT PAID FROM OPERATIONAL APPROPRIATIONS . THE VALIDITY OF THAT ARGUMENT ULTIMATELY DEPENDS ON WHETHER VACANCY NOTICE NO COULD LAWFULLY PRESCRIBE THAT THE POST IN ISSUE COULD BE ASSIGNED ONLY TO AN OFFICIAL PAID FROM THE OPERATIONAL APPROPRIATIONS . IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS APPROPRIATE TO RESERVE JUDGMENT ON THE FIRST TWO SUBMISSIONS AND TO CONSIDER THE OTHER SUBMISSIONS IN THE APPLICATION IN WHICH MR GEIST CHALLENGES THE LEGALITY OF VACANCY NOTICE NO INASMUCH AS IT LAYS DOWN THE RULE THAT ONLY OFFICIALS PAID FROM OPERATIONAL APPROPRIATIONS MAY APPLY FOR THE POST AT ISSUE .  THE THIRD AND FOURTH SUBMISSIONS   ACCORDING TO THE APPLICANT THE EXCLUSION IN THE VACANCY NOTICE OF OFFICIALS PAID FROM RESEARCH APPROPRIATIONS IS IN THE FIRST PLACE CONTRARY TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE DECISION OF JULY WHICH DEFINED VERY WIDELY THE SYSTEM OF ROTATION OF OFFICIALS POSTED TO DELEGATIONS AND OFFICES IN NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES .       IN THAT RESPECT IT MUST BE POINTED OUT THAT ALTHOUGH THE DECISION OF JULY ARRANGES FOR THE TRANSFER OF OFFICIALS BETWEEN THE OFFICES IN NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES AND CENTRAL OFFICES WITHOUT EXPRESSLY MAKING A DISTINCTION BETWEEN OFFICIALS PAID FROM OPERATIONAL APPROPRIATIONS AND THOSE PAID FROM RESEARCH APPROPRIATIONS IT IS NEVERTHELESS THE FACT THAT UNDER POINT II ( 1.) OF THE SAID DECISION OFFICIALS WHO TAKE PART IN GENERAL MOVEMENTS OF ROTATION ARE ASSIGNED TOGETHER WITH THEIR BUDGETARY POSTS .   IT IS APPARENT BOTH FROM THE DOCUMENTS PRODUCED BY THE COMMISSION AND FROM THE ARGUMENTS PUT FORWARD BEFORE THE COURT THAT OFFICIALS PAID FROM RESEARCH APPROPRIATIONS PURSUE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES SPECIALLY DEFINED BY THE COUNCIL . AN OFFICIAL PAID FROM RESEARCH APPROPRIATIONS CANNOT THEREFORE BE ASSIGNED TOGETHER WITH HIS BUDGETARY POST TO TASKS WHICH ARE NOT PART OF A RESEARCH PROGRAMME SINCE SUCH A PRACTICE WOULD BE IN BREACH OF DECISIONS TAKEN BY THE COUNCIL IN RELATION TO RESEARCH AND OF THE BUDGETARY RULES FOR ALLOCATION OF APPROPRIATIONS .   IT IS COMMON GROUND THAT IN THIS CASE THE POST OF FIRST SECRETARY RESPONSIBLE FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL MATTERS IN THE DELEGATION IN WASHINGTON WAS SIMPLY INTENDED TO REPRESENT THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES VIS-A-VIS NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES AND IN NO WAY CONTRIBUTED TO CARRYING OUT A RESEARCH PROGRAMME APPROVED BY THE COUNCIL .   IT FOLLOWS FROM THE FOREGOING THAT IN THE ABSENCE AT THAT TIME OF ANY MECHANISM ENABLING THE RESEARCH BUDGET TO BE COMPENSATED THE COMMISSION COULD NOT ASSIGN AN OFFICIAL PAID FROM RESEARCH APPROPRIATIONS TOGETHER WITH HIS BUDGETARY POST TO THE POST OF FIRST SECRETARY IN WASHINGTON . MR GEIST HAS THEREFORE NO GROUND FOR MAINTAINING THAT IN RESERVING THAT POST TO OFFICIALS PAID FROM OPERATIONAL APPROPRIATIONS VACANCY NOTICE NO WAS IN BREACH OF THE DECISION OF JULY .    IN THE SECOND PLACE THE APPLICANT MAINTAINS THAT IN EXCLUDING OFFICIALS PAID FROM RESEARCH APPROPRIATIONS VACANCY NOTICE NO DISCRIMINATED WITHOUT ANY OBJECTIVE JUSTIFICATION AGAINST OFFICIALS OF THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL STAFF .       IT MUST BE REMEMBERED IN THAT RESPECT THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN OFFICIALS OF THE SCIENTIFIC OR TECHNICAL STAFF PAID FROM APPROPRIATIONS IN THE RESEARCH AND INVESTMENT BUDGET AND OFFICIALS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE OR LANGUAGE STAFF PAID FROM OPERATIONAL APPROPRIATIONS FOLLOWS FROM THE VERY PROVISIONS OF TITLE VIII OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS WHICH INTRODUCES VARIOUS DIFFERENCES OF TREATMENT BETWEEN THOSE TWO CATEGORIES OF STAFF IN CONSIDERATION OF THE SPECIAL FEATURES OF THEIR DUTIES .   IT FOLLOWS FROM THE FOREGOING THAT WHEN VACANCY NOTICE NO ESTABLISHED AN ADDITIONAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE CATEGORIES IT WAS JUSTIFIED BY THE NEED TO APPLY THE DECISION OF JULY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DECISIONS TAKEN BY THE COUNCIL IN RELATION TO RESEARCH AND WITH THE BUDGETARY RULES ON ALLOCATION OF APPROPRIATIONS . THE APPLICANT HAS THEREFORE NO GROUND FOR MAINTAINING THAT VACANCY NOTICE NO UNLAWFULLY DISCRIMINATED BETWEEN OFFICIALS OF THE COMMISSION .   THE APPLICANT ' S FIRST FOUR SUBMISSIONS MUST THEREFORE BE DISMISSED .  FIFTH SUBMISSION   FINALLY THE APPLICANT CLAIMS THAT THE DECISION OF JULY ON THE SYSTEM OF ROTATION OF OFFICIALS ASSIGNED TO NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES WAS UNLAWFUL SINCE IT WAS IN BREACH OF THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS INASMUCH AS THE STAFF COMMITTEE AND THE STAFF REGULATIONS COMMITTEE WERE NOT CONSULTED AND THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT PUBLICITY .   AS THE COURT HAS ALREADY HELD IN ITS JUDGMENT OF DECEMBER IN CASE 791/DEMONT V COMMISSION ( ) ECR THE DECISION OF JULY IS NOT A GENERAL PROVISION FOR GIVING EFFECT TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS AS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE OF THOSE REGULATIONS BUT FLOWS FROM THE GENERAL POWER WHICH EACH INSTITUTION HAS TO ORGANZIE ITS OWN DEPARTMENTS IN THE INTERESTS OF THEIR EFFICIENT WORKING .   IT FOLLOWS THAT WITHOUT ITS BEING NECESSARY TO DECIDE UPON ITS ADMISSIBILITY THE SUBMISSION THAT THE FORMALITIES OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS WERE DISREGARDED IS INVALID AND MUST BE REJECTED .
