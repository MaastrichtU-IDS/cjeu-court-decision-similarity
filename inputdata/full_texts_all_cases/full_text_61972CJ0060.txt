IN THE MATTER, AT THE PRESENT STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS, OF THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE PROCEDURE OF COMPETITION COM/A/264, INCLUDING THE NOTICE OF COMPETITION, AND ALSO OF THE PROCEDURES OF COMPETITIONS COM/A/265, COM/A/266, COM/A/267, COM/A/268, INCLUDING THE NOTICES OF COMPETITION,

THE COMMISSION, DEFENDANT IN THE MAIN ACTION, HAS RAISED AN OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY BASED ON NON-OBSERVANCE OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  PARAGRAPH OF THIS ARTICLE, AS AMENDED BY REGULATION NO 1473/OF JULY 1972, PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ON JULY 1972, MAKES THE ADMISSIBILITY OF AN APPLICATION TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE DEPENDENT UPON THE PRIOR SUBMISSION BY THE APPLICANT TO THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY OF A COMPLAINT WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) AGAINST AN ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING HIM .  THE QUESTION OF ADMISSIBILITY MUST BE RESOLVED ON THE BASIS OF THE RULES IN FORCE AT THE DATE ON WHICH THE APPLICATION WAS SUBMITTED .  THE FIRST STEP IS ACCORDINGLY TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE APPLICANT HAS SUBMITTED TO THE COMMISSION A PRIOR COMPLAINT AGAINST AN ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING HER .  ON THIS POINT THE APPLICANT RELIES UPON A LETTER WHICH SHE ADDRESSED ON MAY TO THE MEMBER OF THE COMMISSION RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS .  THIS LETTER WAS BASED, ACCORDING TO THE APPLICANT' S OWN STATEMENTS, ON CERTAIN INFORMATION WHICH HAD COME TO HER, BUT OF WHICH SHE DOES NOT GIVE THE SOURCE .  THE RESULT OF HER PERFORMANCE IN THE COMPETITION WAS NOT, HOWEVER, NOTIFIED TO THE APPLICANT UNTIL JUNE, THAT IS SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER THE DISPATCH OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED LETTER .  UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THIS LETTER CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS A COMPLAINT AGAINST AN ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE APPLICANT .  THE APPLICATION IS ACCORDINGLY INADMISSIBLE UNDER THE TERMS OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  
Decision on costs
THE APPLICANT HAS FAILED IN HER APPLICATION .  UNDER THE TERMS OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY SHALL BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .  HOWEVER, UNDER THE TERMS OF ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE INSTITUTIONS IN APPLICATIONS BY SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES ARE BORNE BY THE INSTITUTIONS .
