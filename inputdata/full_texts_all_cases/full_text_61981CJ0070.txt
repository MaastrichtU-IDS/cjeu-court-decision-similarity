Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT BY NOT IMPLEMENTING WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 75/OF JUNE , ON THE DISPOSAL OF WASTE OILS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ), THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON APRIL THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR A DECLARATION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY THAT BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NEEDED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 75/OF JUNE ON THE DISPOSAL OF WASTE OILS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ), THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE THIRD PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .   BY VIRTUE OF ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE MEMBER STATES WERE TO IMPLEMENT THE MEASURES NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH THE DIRECTIVE WITHIN TWENTY-FOUR MONTHS OF ITS NOTIFICATION AND THAT PERIOD EXPIRED IN THIS CASE ON JUNE .        THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT HAS STATED THAT THE DIRECTIVE HAS ALREADY BEEN THE SUBJECT OF CERTAIN MEASURES WHICH IMPLEMENT IT IN PART . NEVERTHELESS , IT DOES NOT DENY THAT THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM HAS NOT FULFILLED ITS OBLIGATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE DIRECTIVE FULLY WITHIN THE PERIOD PROVIDED .   ESSENTIALLY , THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT JUSTIFIES ITS FAILURE BY THE FACT THAT IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS CONCERNING THE REDISTRIBUTION OF POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES BETWEEN THE NATIONAL AND REGIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE IN PROGRESS , ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA COVERED BY THE DIRECTIVE IN QUESTION . SO LONG AS THE NEW INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT YET IN A POSITION TO EXERCISE THEIR POWERS IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT THE DIRECTIVE FULLY .   ALTHOUGH THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY EXPLAIN THE DIFFICULTY IN APPLYING THE DIRECTIVE THEY DO NOT EXPUNGE THE FAILURE OF THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS . ACCORDING TO ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW OF THE COURT A MEMBER STATE MAY NOT PLEAD PROVISIONS , PRACTICES OR CIRCUMSTANCES IN ITS INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM TO JUSTIFY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OBLIGATIONS UNDER COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES .   IT SHOULD ALSO BE POINTED OUT THAT , IN ORDER THAT THE EXCEPTIONAL SITUATION REFERRED TO BY HIS GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT , THE BELGIAN MINISTER FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT , IN ANSWER TO THE REASONED OPINION PROVIDED FOR IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY , REQUESTED THE COMMISSION ON NOVEMBER TO GRANT TO THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM AN ADDITIONAL PERIOD OF ONE YEAR TO ADOPT THE MEASURES OF NATIONAL LAW NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT THE DIRECTIVE . THOSE MEASURES OUGHT TO HAVE ENTERED INTO FORCE IN JUNE , AND IN FACT IT WAS ONLY ON APRIL THAT THE COMMISSION BROUGHT THE MATTER BEFORE THE COURT UNDER THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .   IT MUST THEREFORE BE HELD THAT BY NOT ADOPTING WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 75/OF JUNE THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY .  
Decision on costs
