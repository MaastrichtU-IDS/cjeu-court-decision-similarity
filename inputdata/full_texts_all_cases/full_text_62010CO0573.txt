Article 104(3), first indent, of the Rules of Procedure – Internal taxation – Article TFEU – Pollution tax levied on first registration of motor vehicles
Tax provisions – Internal taxation – Pollution tax levies on motor vehicles on their first registration in national territory – Tax applicable to imported second-hand vehicles and without any equivalent for vehicles of the same age and the same condition

Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Curtea de Appel Timișoara – Registration of second-hand vehicles previously registered
                  in other Member States – Environmental tax on motor vehicles on their first registration in a Member State – Compatibility
                  of national legislation with Article TFEU – Validity of the exemption from payment of the tax in respect of certain categories
                  of vehicle.
               
Operative part 
Article TFEU must be interpreted as meaning that it precludes a Member State from introducing a pollution tax on motor
         vehicles on first registration in that Member State if that fiscal measure is set up in such a way as to discourage the placing
         on the market in that Member State of second-hand vehicles purchased in other Member States without discouraging the purchase
         of second-hand vehicles of a similar age and condition on the national market.
