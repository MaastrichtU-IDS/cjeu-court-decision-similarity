BY A SEPARATE DOCUMENT DATED OCTOBER , THE COUNCIL RAISED AN OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE AND APPLIED TO THE COURT FOR A DECISION ON THAT OBJECTION WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CASE .  . ACCORDING TO THE COUNCIL , THE ACTION BROUGHT IS INADMISSIBLE BECAUSE THE APPLICANTS ARE NOT CHALLENGING ANY MEASURE ADOPTED BY IT AND BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH IT SUCH AS THAT WHICH EXISTS BETWEEN A COMMUNITY INSTITUTION , IN ITS CAPACITY AS APPOINTING AUTHORITY , AND ITS OFFICIALS .  . IN THEIR OBSERVATIONS ON THE OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY RAISED BY THE COUNCIL , THE APPLICANTS HAVE NOT ADVANCED ANY ARGUMENT TO THE EFFECT THAT THAT OBJECTION IS UNFOUNDED . THEY LIMIT THEMSELVES TO STATING THAT THEY ' ' RESPECTFULLY LEAVE IT FOR THE COURT TO DECIDE AS IT THINKS FIT ON THE OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY ' ' .  . IT SHOULD BE POINTED OUT THAT THE ACTION IS NOT DIRECTED AGAINST A MEASURE ADOPTED BY THE COUNCIL BUT CONTESTS THE SALARY STATEMENTS ISSUED BY THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE , THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY , AND ALSO THE REJECTION BY THE SAME AUTHORITY OF THEIR COMPLAINTS LODGED UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS . SIMILARLY , THE APPLICATION FOR COMPENSATION IS DIRECTED ONLY AGAINST THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE . CONSEQUENTLY , THE APPLICATION BROUGHT BY THE APPLICANTS IS INADMISSIBLE IN SO FAR AS IT IS DIRECTED AGAINST THE COUNCIL .
