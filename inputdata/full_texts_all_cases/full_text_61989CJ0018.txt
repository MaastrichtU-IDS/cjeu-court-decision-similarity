Summary
As the Court has already held ( see the judgments of October in Case 125/Koninklijke Scholten-Honig and Another v Hoofdproduktschap voor Akkerbouwprodukten (( )) ECR and Joined Cases and 145/Royal Scholten-Honig ( Holdings ) Limited and Another v Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce (( )) ECR ), there must be no discrimination against producers of sugar in the foodstuffs sector in comparison with producers of isoglucose, with whom they are in competition, by providing the latter with benefits the equivalent of which the former do not enjoy . Article 5a() of Regulation No 2742/on production refunds in the cereals and rice sectors, which provides that no production refunds are to be granted for products destined for the manufacture of isoglucose, must be interpreted in the light of that objective .  In the chemicals sector, however, the situation is different . In the production of sorbitol, isoglucose is in competition either with sugar in the form of invert sugar or with glucose, both of which, when used for that purpose, qualify for production refunds, with the result that sorbitol producers who use isoglucose would suffer discrimination contrary to the second subparagraph of Article 40() of the Treaty if no refund could be granted for the intermediate product which they use . It follows that Article 5a of Regulation No 2742/75, properly construed, does not prohibit production refunds in respect of products intended for the manufacture of isoglucose when that isoglucose is to be used as an intermediate product, not intended for marketing, in the manufacture of sorbitol .
