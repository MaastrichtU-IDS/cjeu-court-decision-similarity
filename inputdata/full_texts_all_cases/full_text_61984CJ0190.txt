Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JULY THE PARTI ECOLOGISTE "LES VERTS", A NON-PROFITMAKING ASSOCIATION, BROUGHT AN ACTION PURSUANT TO THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY  LYA/DE/MA  FOR THE ANNULMENT OF "ALL THE DECISIONS IMPLEMENTING THE BUDGET OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY IN RESPECT OF ITEM ".  ACCORDING TO THE APPLICATION, THE ACTION CONCERNS IN PARTICULAR "THE DECISIONS OF THE AUTHORIZING OFFICER TO ENTER INTO COMMITMENTS OF EXPENDITURE AND ORDER PAYMENTS, THE DECISIONS OF THE ACCOUNTING OFFICER EFFECTING PAYMENT, THE DECISIONS PROPOSING THE COMMITMENT OF EXPENDITURE ADOPTED UNDER ARTICLES ET SEQ . OF THE FINANCIAL REGULATION, THE DECISIONS OF THE FINANCIAL CONTROLLER WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF GIVING HIS APPROVAL TO THE COMMITMENT PROPOSALS, THE DECISIONS OF THE AUTHORIZING OFFICER VALIDATING THE EXPENDITURE UNDER ARTICLES ET SEQ . OF THE FINANCIAL REGULATION, THE DECISIONS OF THE AUTHORIZING OFFICER AUTHORIZING THE EXPENDITURE UNDER ARTICLES ET SEQ . OF THE FINANCIAL REGULATION AND THE DECISIONS OF THE ACCOUNTING OFFICER IMPLEMENTING THE PAYMENT OF EXPENDITURE UNDER ARTICLES ET SEQ . OF THE FINANCIAL REGULATION ".  REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING FOR AN ACCOUNT OF THE FACTS, THE COURSE OF THE PROCEDURE AND THE SUBMISSIONS AND ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES, WHICH ARE MENTIONED OR DISCUSSED HEREINAFTER ONLY IN SO FAR AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE REASONING OF THE COURT .  IN SUPPORT OF THE ADMISSIBILITY OF ITS ACTION THE APPLICANT ASSOCIATION ARGUES IN PARTICULAR THAT ALTHOUGH IN ITS ORDERS OF SEPTEMBER ( IN CASES 216/83, 295/83, 296/AND 297/83, (( ))  ECR 3325, 3331, AND RESPECTIVELY ), THE COURT DECLARED INADMISSIBLE THE ACTIONS BROUGHT BY THE ASSOCIATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE MEASURES PREPARATORY TO THE APPROVAL OF THE BUDGET, IT RECOGNIZED THAT A NATURAL OR LEGAL PERSON MAY BE DIRECTLY CONCERNED BY MEASURES IMPLEMENTING THE BUDGET .  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT DOES NOT DENY THAT AN ACTION FOR ANNULMENT CAN BE BROUGHT AGAINST FINANCIAL IMPLEMENTING MEASURES, BUT SUBMITS THAT THIS ACTION MUST BE DECLARED INADMISSIBLE BECAUSE THE CONTESTED MEASURES ARE THE RESULT OF INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS CALCULATING THE SHARE OF THE APPROPRIATIONS TO BE ALLOCATED TO EACH POLITICAL GROUPING, DECISIONS WHICH ARE NOW FINAL AND IRREVOCABLE SINCE THEY WERE NOT CHALLENGED BEFORE THE COURT AND INDEED COULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN SO FAR AS THEY WERE ADDRESSED TO POLICITAL GROUPINGS OTHER THAN THE APPLICANT .  IN ITS JUDGMENT OF APRIL ( CASE 294/83, PARTI ECOLOGISTE 'LES VERTS" V EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, (( )) ECR ), THE COURT ANNULLED THE DECISION OF THE BUREAU OF OCTOBER CONCERNING THE ALLOCATION OF THE APPROPRIATIONS ENTERED UNDER ITEM AND THE RULES ADOPTED BY THE ENLARGED BUREAU ON OCTOBER GOVERNING THE USE OF THE APPROPRIATIONS FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENDITURE INCURRED BY THE POLITICAL GROUPINGS HAVING TAKEN PART IN THE EUROPEAN ELECTIONS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL NO . C 293, P . ).  THIS ACTION IS BROUGHT AGAINST MEASURES ENTERING INTO COMMITMENTS OF EXPENDITURE AND VALIDATING, AUTHORIZING AND IMPLEMENTING THE PAYMENT OF EXPENDITURE PURSUANT TO THE ABOVE-MENTIONED DECISIONS OF THE BUREAU AND THE ENLARGED BUREAU AND TO THE CALCULATION UNDER THOSE DECISIONS OF THE SHARE OF THE APPROPRIATIONS TO BE ALLOCATED TO THE DIFFERENT POLITICAL GROUPINGS .  SUCH MEASURES HAVE ONLY INTERNAL LEGAL EFFECTS WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION, AND GIVE RISE TO NO RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS ON THE PART OF THIRD PARTIES . THEY THEREFORE DO NOT CONSTITUTE DECISIONS ADVERSELY AFFECTING ANY PERSON . CONSEQUENTLY, THE ACTION MUST BE DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE .
