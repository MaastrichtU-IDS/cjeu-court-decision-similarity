Subject of the case
APPLICATIONS UNDER ARTICLE AND THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY , 
Grounds
IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE PARTIES HAVE ESTABLISHED THE AMOUNTS OF COMPENSATION BY AGREEMENT , CASES , AND TO 249/MUST BE REMOVED FROM THE COURT REGISTER .   IN PURSUANCE OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE COURT IS TO GIVE A DECISION AS TO COSTS IN ITS FINAL JUDGMENT OR IN THE ORDER WHICH CLOSES THE PROCEEDINGS .   IN ITS INTERLOCUTORY JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER (( ) ECR ) IN THESE CASES THE COURT RESERVED THE COSTS .   BY LETTERS OF JANUARY THE APPLICANTS IN THESE CASES ASKED THE COURT TO ADJUDICATE ON THE COSTS RECOVERABLE .   THE COURT MUST THEREFORE ADJUDICATE ON THE SHARING OF COSTS IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE SECOND CHAMBER TO TAX THE RECOVERABLE COSTS .       UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .   UNDER ARTICLE ( ) THE COURT MAY , WHERE EACH PARTY SUCCEEDS ON SOME AND FAILS ON OTHER HEADS OR WHERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE EXCEPTIONAL , ORDER THE PARTIES TO BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS IN WHOLE OR IN PART .   IT MAY BE SEEN FROM THE INTERLOCUTORY JUDGMENT THAT THE COUNCIL AND THE COMMISSION WERE UNSUCCESSFUL AS REGARDS ALL THEIR LEGAL SUBMISSIONS . THE REDUCTIONS IN THE AMOUNTS CLAIMED , WHICH WERE MADE FOLLOWING NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES ARE NOT SO GREAT AS TO HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE SHARING OF COSTS .   THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY MUST THEREFORE BE ORDERED TO BEAR THE WHOLE OF THE COSTS .
