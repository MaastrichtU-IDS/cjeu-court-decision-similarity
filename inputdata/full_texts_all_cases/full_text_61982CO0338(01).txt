Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF VARIOUS DECISIONS OF THE HEAD OF THE APPLIED MECHANICS DIVISION OF THE JOINT NUCLEAR RESEARCH CENTRE WHEREBY THE APPLICANTS WERE FORBIDDEN TO HAVE CONTACT IN THE COURSE OF THEIR DUTIES WITH CERTAIN EXTERNAL ASSOCIATES , TO TAKE PART IN A SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCE ORGANIZED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CAIRO OR TO PUBLISH A SCIENTIFIC     PAPER AT THAT CONFERENCE , AND OF AN INTERNAL MEMORANDUM RELIEVING THE APPLICANTS OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR RESEARCH INTO THE DYNAMIC BEHAVIOUR OF MATERIALS , 
Grounds
UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE AN APPLICATION FOR THE SUSPENSION OF A MEASURE MUST , IN THE FIRST PLACE , STATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO URGENCY . AS FAR AS THE CLAIMS ON WHICH JUDGMENT WAS RESERVED IN THE ORDER OF DECEMBER ARE CONCERNED , THE APPLICANTS HAVE FAILED TO SUPPLY ANY EVIDENCE TO THAT EFFECT .   IN SO FAR AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO JUDGE AT THIS EARLY STAGE , THE DECISIONS CONCERNING OUTSIDE CONTACTS DEAL WITH MINOR ISSUES OF AN ESSENTIALLY ADMINISTRATIVE NATURE IN CARRYING OUT THE RESEARCH PROGRAMMES OF THE JOINT NUCLEAR RESEARCH CENTRE . THE DECISIONS DO NOT APPEAR EITHER TO JEOPARDIZE THE GOOD MANAGEMENT OF THOSE PROGRAMMES IN THE SHORT TERM , OR TO BE LIABLE TO AFFECT IRREVERSIBLY THE RIGHTS OF THE APPLICANTS AS REGARDS THEIR EMPLOYMENT .   AS TO THE INTERNAL MEMORANDUM OF NOVEMBER ALTERING THE DUTIES OF THE APPLICANTS , THE COMMISSION HAS CORRECTLY REMARKED THAT IF THE APPLICANTS ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR ACTION THEY MAY EASILY BE REINSTATED IN THEIR PREVIOUS POSITIONS .   IT FOLLOWS FROM THE FOREGOING THAT SINCE THE APPLICANTS HAVE FAILED TO ESTABLISH URGENCY , THE CLAIMS ON WHICH JUDGMENT WAS RESERVED BY THE ORDER OF DECEMBER MUST BE DISMISSED .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECOND CHAMBER , ACTING AS PRESIDENT OF THE COURT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ), THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE AND THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE ,   HEREBY ORDERS AS FOLLOWS :   . THE APPLICATIONS FOR THE SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF THE DECISIONS OF THE HEAD OF THE APPLIED MECHANICS DIVISION OF THE JOINT NUCLEAR RESEARCH CENTRE OF SEPTEMBER , OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER ARE DISMISSED .  . COSTS ARE RESERVED .
