Grounds
THE UNION' S APPLICATION TO INTERVENE IS CONCERNED WITH CASES 41/73, TO 48/73, 50/73, 111/73, 113/AND 114/. THE APPLICATION SHOULD BE DECIDED BY A SINGLE ORDER, IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE UNION' S JUSTIFICATION FOR INTERVENING IS IDENTICAL IN ALL THOSE CASES .  UNDER THE TERMS OF ARTICLE OF THE PROTOCOL ON THE STATUTE OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EEC, THE RIGHT TO INTERVENE IN CASES BEFORE THE COURT IS OPEN, APART FROM THE MEMBER STATES AND INSTITUTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY, " TO ANY OTHER PERSON ESTABLISHING AN INTEREST IN THE RESULT " OF SUCH A CASE .  PURSUANT TO THIS PROVISION, BODIES NOT HAVING LEGAL PERSONALITY MAY BE PERMITTED TO INTERVENE IF THEY DISPLAY THE CHARACTERISTICS WHICH ARE AT THE FOUNDATION OF SUCH PERSONALITY, IN PARTICULAR, THE ABILITY, HOWEVER CIRCUMSCRIBED, TO UNDERTAKE AUTONOMOUS ACTION AND TO ASSUME LIABILITY .  IT IS CLEAR FROM THE STATUTE OF THE UNION THAT THE LATTER FULFILS THESE REQUIREMENTS .  IT FOLLOWS FROM ARTICLE OF THE SAID STATUTE THAT THE UNION HAS AS ITS ESPECIAL OBJECT " THE REPRESENTATION AND PROTECTION ... OF ALL ITALIAN CONSUMERS ... IN JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS ", WHERE " THE INTERESTS OF THE WHOLE CATEGORY OF CONSUMERS OR OF A CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE LATTER ARE IN ISSUE ", AND THAT IT IS THE UNION' S INTENTION TO " CONTRIBUTE TO THE ABOLITION OF OBSTACLES IMPOSED BY THE MARKET AND BY INSTITUTIONS UPON THE FREE COMPETITION OF PRODUCERS AND TRADERS AND UPON THE FREE AND CONSCIOUS CHOICE OF CONSUMERS ".  IT APPEARS FROM THE DECREE NO OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF JULY ( ORDINARY SUPPLEMENT TO THE GAZZETTA UFFICIALE NO OF JULY 1963, P . ET SEQ .), AND FROM A DECREE OF THE MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY OF SEPTEMBER ( GAZZETTA UFFICIALE NO OF MARCH 1968, P . TO ), THAT THE UNION OR ITS PRESIDENT ARE CALLED UPON TO SIT ON CERTAIN COMMITTEES CONVENED BY THE ITALIAN PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND THAT THEREFORE IT EXERCISES THE REQUISITE DEGREE OF REPRESENTATION .  SINCE IT IS THE PARTICULAR OBJECTIVE OF THE UNION TO REPRESENT AND PROTECT CONSUMERS, IT CAN SHOW AN INTEREST IN THE CORRECT APPLICATION OF COMMUNITY PROVISIONS IN THE FIELD OF COMPETITION, WHICH NOT ONLY ENSURE THAT THE COMMON MARKET OPERATES NORMALLY BUT WHICH ALSO TEND TO FAVOUR CONSUMERS .  ACCORDINGLY THE UNION HAS AN INTEREST IN THE SOLUTION OF THE CASES AT ISSUE, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LATTER CONCERN THE FINDING THAT THE APPLICANTS IN THE MAIN ACTIONS INDULGED IN A CONCERTED PRACTICE WITH THE OBJECT AND EFFECT OF PROTECTING THE ITALIAN MARKET .  ACCORDINGLY, THE INTERVENTION MUST BE PERMITTED INSOFAR AS IT SUPPORTS THE SUBMISSIONS OF THE COMMISSION WITH REGARD TO ITS FINDING AS TO THE PROTECTION OF THE ITALIAN MARKET .
