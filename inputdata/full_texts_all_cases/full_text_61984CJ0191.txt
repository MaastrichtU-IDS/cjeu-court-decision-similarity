Grounds
JUDGMENT  ( THE ACCOUNT OF THE FACTS AND ISSUES WHICH IS CONTAINED IN THE COMPLETE TEXT OF THE JUDGMENT IS NOT REPRODUCED )   DECISION  BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JULY , FRANCO ROSSI AND OTHER OFFICIALS OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES IN GRADES D , D AND D BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF COMMISSION DECISIONS OF NOVEMBER , DECEMBER AND JANUARY REFUSING TO RECLASSIFY THEM IN CATEGORY C .   IN THEIR REPLY , THE APPLICANTS ASKED THE COURT TO ' DECLARE THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED , WITHOUT BEING SUBJECT TO DISCIPLINARY MEASURES , TO REFUSE TO CARRY OUT DUTIES WHICH DO NOT CORRESPOND TO THEIR GRADE . '  THE COMMISSION OBJECTS TO THAT CHANGE IN THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF THE APPLICATION , WHICH WAS NOT SET OUT IN THE ORIGINAL APPLICATION OR REFERRED TO DURING THE PRE-LITIGATION STAGE .  IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY FIRST OF ALL TO DEFINE THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF THE PROCEEDINGS .  THE CLAIM PUT FORWARD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE REPLY MODIFIES THE ORIGINAL SUBJECT-MATTER OF THE APPLICATION AND MUST BE REGARDED AS A NEW CLAIM . UNDER ARTICLE ( ) IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE AND THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE STATUTE OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EEC , THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF THE CLAIM MUST BE SET OUT IN THE APPLICATION , AND NO NEW CLAIM MAY BE SUBMITTED IN THE COURSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS .  CONSEQUENTLY , THE CLAIM PUT FORWARD IN THE REPLY MUST BE CONSIDERED INADMISSIBLE , AND THE PROCEEDINGS THEREFORE CONCERN ONLY THE CLAIM FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE REFUSAL TO RECLASSIFY THE APPLICANTS .  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MR BLASIUS , WHO WAS APPOINTED AS AN OFFICIAL IN GRADE D ON JANUARY , THE APPLICANTS WERE ALL EMPLOYED INITIALLY AS LOCAL OR TEMPORARY STAFF BETWEEN AND . AFTER ENTERING AND PASSING COMPETITIONS , THEY WERE APPOINTED AS PROBATIONARY OFFICIALS IN GRADES D OR D BETWEEN AND , THE LAST OF THEM ON APRIL . THEY WERE ESTABLISHED IN THOSE GRADES IN THE COURSE OF AND , THE LAST OF THEM ON OCTOBER . IT APPEARS FROM THE DOCUMENTS BEFORE THE COURT THAT THE NATURE OF THE APPLICANTS '  WORK HAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED SINCE THEY ENTERED THE SERVICE OF THE COMMISSION AS LOCAL OR TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES .  THE APPLICANTS TAKE THE VIEW THAT THEIR WORK DOES NOT FALL UNDER CATEGORY D - OFFICIALS ENGAGED IN ELEMENTARY OR ROUTINE WORK - BUT UNDER CATEGORY C - OFFICIALS ENGAGED IN THE EXECUTION OF WORK OF A TECHNICAL NATURE NECESSITATING A PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND AND QUALIFICATIONS SUPPORTED IN PRINCIPLE BY A CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPATIONAL PROFICIENCY OR ACQUIRED THROUGH PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE - IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TABLE SHOWING BASIC POSTS AS PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS PUBLISHED IN THE COMMISSION ' S ADMINISTRATIVE NOTICES NO . OF JULY . ACCORDINGLY , BY REQUESTS SUBMITTED ON SEPTEMBER , NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , THEY ASKED THE COMMISSION TO RECLASSIFY THEIR POSTS , STATING THAT THE INSTRUMENTS APPOINTING THEM AND CLASSIFYING THEM IN CATEGORY D WERE AT VARIANCE WITH THE TABLE OF BASIC POSTS .  THOSE REQUESTS WERE EXPRESSLY REJECTED BY THE COMMISSION BY DECISIONS OF NOVEMBER , DECEMBER AND JANUARY . ON DECEMBER AND JANUARY , THE APPLICANTS SUBMITTED COMPLAINTS AGAIN REQUESTING THEIR RECLASSIFICATION IN CATEGORY C . THE COMMISSION DID NOT REPLY TO THOSE COMPLAINTS , AND THE APPLICANTS THEREFORE BROUGHT THIS ACTION ON JULY .   THE COMMISSION OBJECTS THAT THE ACTION IS OUT OF TIME AND THEREFORE INADMISSIBLE , ON THE GROUND THAT THE ACTS ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE APPLICANTS WERE THE INITIAL DECISIONS APPOINTING THEM AS OFFICIALS . THE REQUESTS FOR RECLASSIFICATION SUBMITTED TO THE COMMISSION MUST THEREFORE BE REGARDED AS COMPLAINTS AGAINST THOSE DECISIONS . HOWEVER , THOSE COMPLAINTS WERE NOT BROUGHT WITHIN THE PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE APPOINTMENT OF EACH APPLICANT . THE PUBLICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE NOTICES NO ON JULY , CONTAINING THE TABLE SHOWING BASIC POSTS AS PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , DID NOT CONSTITUTE A NEW EVENT JUSTIFYING THE RE-OPENING OF THE PERIOD FOR SUBMITTING A COMPLAINT . THE APPLICANTS WERE APPOINTED IN THE GRADE IN WHICH THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN CLASSIFIED AND THEIR DUTIES REMAINED IDENTICAL .  IN ITS JUDGMENT OF JUNE ( CASE 173/BLASIG V COMMISSION ( ) ECR ), THE COURT HELD THAT IN THE CASE OF A REQUEST FOR RECLASSIFICATION THE MEASURE ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE APPLICANT IS THE DECISION APPOINTING HIM AS A PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL . IT IS THAT DECISION WHICH DEFINES THE DUTIES FOR WHICH THE OFFICIAL HAS BEEN APPOINTED AND DEFINITIVELY FIXES THE CORRESPONDING GRADE . THE DECISION ESTABLISHING THE OFFICIAL MERELY CONFIRMS THAT DECISION .  AN OFFICIAL MAY CHALLENGE HIS CLASSIFICATION ON RECRUITMENT ONLY UNDER THE CONDITIONS AND WITHIN THE TIME-LIMITS LAID DOWN IN THE STAFF REGULATIONS ( SEE THE JUDGMENT OF DECEMBER IN CASE 198/BLOMEFIELD V COMMISSION ( ) ECR ). THE TIME-LIMITS LAID DOWN IN ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS ARE MANDATORY AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE DISCRETION OF THE PARTIES OR OF THE COURT , SINCE THEY WERE LAID DOWN WITH A VIEW TO ENSURING CLARITY AND LEGAL CERTAINTY ( SEE THE JUDGMENTS OF MARCH IN JOINED CASES AND 117/RAZZOUK AND BEYDOUN V COMMISSION ( ) ECR , AND JULY IN CASE 227/MOUSSIS V COMMISSION ( ) ECR ). AN OFFICIAL CANNOT CONTRIVE TO RE-OPEN THE LIMITATION PERIODS BY SUBMITTING A REQUEST TO THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS RATHER THAN A COMPLAINT AGAINST THE DECISION ADVERSELY AFFECTING HIM . THE APPLICANTS '  ' REQUESTS FOR RECLASSIFICATION '  MUST THEREFORE BE REGARDED AS COMPLAINTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT WITHIN THREE MONTHS OF THE ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING THEM .  
Decision on costs
ONCE THE TIME-LIMITS FOR THE COMMENCEMENT OF PROCEEDINGS AGAINST AN ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING AN OFFICIAL HAVE EXPIRED , A REQUEST UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS MAY BE BROUGHT ONLY IN THE EVENT OF A NEW CIRCUMSTANCE ARISING WHICH MAKES IT NECESSARY TO RECONSIDER THE SITUATION . THE PUBLICATION IN ADMINISTRATIVE NOTICES NO OF JULY OF THE TABLE OF BASIC POSTS DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A NEW CIRCUMSTANCE . THE TABLE DOES NOT ALTER THE DESCRIPTION OF THE APPLICANTS '  POSTS , BUT MERELY BRINGS UP TO DATE THE TABLE PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED IN ADMINISTRATIVE NOTICES NO OF SEPTEMBER , INCORPORATING THE AMENDMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE REGARDING CATEGORIES A AND B AND CERTAIN POSTS IN CATEGORY C INVOLVING DATA PROCESSING . IN ANY EVENT , AS THE COURT HELD IN ITS JUDGMENT OF JUNE ( BLASIG , REFERRED TO ABOVE ), THE DESCRIPTION OF BASIC POSTS DOES NOT ENTITLE STAFF TO REQUIRE , AFTER APPOINTMENT IN A GIVEN GRADE , A HIGHER GRADE OUTSIDE THE NORMAL PROMOTION PROCEDURE .  SINCE THE LAST OF THE APPLICANTS WAS APPOINTED ON APRIL , AND THE FIRST , MR BLASIUS , ON JANUARY , THE LIMITATION PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS HAD ALREADY EXPIRED BY SEPTEMBER , NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER , THE DATES ON WHICH THE REQUESTS FOR RECLASSIFICATION WERE SUBMITTED .  
Operative part
UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AN APPEAL TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE LIES ONLY WHERE THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY HAS PREVIOUSLY HAD A COMPLAINT SUBMITTED TO IT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) WITHIN THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED THEREIN . SINCE THE COMPLAINTS WERE SUBMITTED AFTER THE EXPIRY OF THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS THE ACTION BROUGHT BY THE APPLICANTS MUST BE DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE .  COSTS  UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE , THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS . HOWEVER , UNDER ARTICLE OF THOSE RULES , INSTITUTIONS ARE TO BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS IN PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES .  ON THOSE GROUNDS ,   THE COURT ( SECOND CHAMBER )
