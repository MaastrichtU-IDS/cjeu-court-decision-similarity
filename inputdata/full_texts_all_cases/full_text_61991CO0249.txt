Parties

Grounds
By letter lodged at the Court Registry on February 1994, the Commission of the European Communities informed the Court, in accordance with Article of the Rules of Procedure, that it wished to discontinue the proceedings and applied, in accordance with Article 69(5) of the Rules of Procedure, for the costs to be borne by the French Republic.  By letter lodged at the Court Registry on March 1994, the defendant acknowledged the discontinuance and did not raise any objections to an order that it should bear the costs.  Pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 69(5) of the Rules of Procedure, a party who discontinues proceedings is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the other party' s pleadings. However, upon application by the party who discontinues the proceedings, the costs are to be borne by the other party if this appears justified by the conduct of that party.  In the present case, the Commission instituted and subsequently discontinued the proceedings as a result of the conduct of the French Republic, which only adopted the measures needed to fulfil its obligations after the Commission had initiated proceedings.  The French Republic should therefore be ordered to pay the costs.  
Operative part
On those grounds,  THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT  hereby orders as follows:  1. Case C-249/shall be removed from the register;  2. The French Republic shall bear the costs.  Luxembourg, March 1994.
