IN CASE 32/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE SOZIALGERICHT AUGSBURG FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  ANTONIO GIULIANI , SAN MARCO IN LAMIS ( ITALY )   AND  LANDESVERSICHERUNGSANSTALT SCHWABEN , AUGSBURG  
Subject of the case
ON THE VALIDITY OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1408/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE APPLICATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEMES TO EMPLOYED PERSONS AND THEIR FAMILIES MOVING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY ( OJ , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P . ) 
Grounds
BY ORDER OF JANUARY , WHICH REACHED THE COURT REGISTRY ON MARCH , THE SOZIALGERICHT AUGSBURG REFERRED CERTAIN QUESTIONS UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1408/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE APPLICATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEMES TO EMPLOYED PERSONS AND THEIR FAMILIES MOVING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY ( OJ , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P . ).   THOSE QUESTIONS ARE REFERRED IN CONNEXION WITH PROCEEDINGS CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH THE COMPETENT GERMAN INSTITUTION CALCULATED THE INVALIDITY PENSION OF AN ITALIAN NATIONAL , THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION , WHO RESIDES IN ITALY AND WHO WORKED FIRST IN ITALY AND SUBSEQUENTLY IN GERMANY .  THE FILE SHOWS THAT THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION SATISFIES THE CONDITIONS FOR ENTITLEMENT TO A PENSION UNDER GERMAN LEGISLATION ALONE BUT THAT , FAILING THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1408/, PAYMENT OF THE PENSION WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE BEEN HELD IN ABEYANCE BY VIRTUE OF A RESIDENCE CLAUSE CONTAINED IN THAT LEGISLATION .  ACTING UNDER THE RULE LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1408/, FOR THE LIMITATION OF BENEFITS , THE GERMAN INSTITUTION CALCULATED THE PENSION OF THE PERSON CONCERNED BY AGGREGATING THE ITALIAN AND GERMAN PERIODS OF INSURANCE AND APPORTIONING THE BENEFIT , WHICH IT SUBSEQUENTLY ADJUSTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PARAGRAPH ( ) OF THE SAID ARTICLE .  THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION CLAIMS THAT HE SHOULD BE GRANTED A PENSION CALCULATED EXCLUSIVELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF GERMAN LEGISLATION .   THE FIRST QUESTION ASKS WHETHER THE COURT OF JUSTICE , ' HAVING REGARD TO THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY , ADHERES TO ITS RULING ( JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER IN PETRONI , CASE 24/) TO THE EFFECT THAT ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/OF THE COUNCIL IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH ARTICLE OF THE TREATY TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT IMPOSES A LIMITATION ON THE OVERLAPPING OF TWO BENEFITS ACQUIRED IN DIFFERENT MEMBER STATES BY A REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF A BENEFIT ACQUIRED UNDER THE NATIONAL LEGISLATION OF A MEMBER STATE ALONE ' .  IT IS THEN ASKED WHETHER ' ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/OF THE COUNCIL IS , WHERE APPROPRIATE , VALID IN SO FAR AS RIGHTS TO PAYMENT ARE THEREBY LIMITED WHICH WOULD NOT EXIST IN THE ABSENCE OF COMMUNITY LAW ' .  IT IS FURTHER ASKED WHETHER ' RIGHTS TO PAYMENT EXIST IN THE ABSENCE OF COMMUNITY LAW OR WHETHER SUCH RIGHTS ARE ACQUIRED UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF A MEMBER STATE , THEY CAN BE REALIZED , BY REASON OF NATIONAL SUSPENSORY PROVISIONS , ONLY THROUGH THE WAIVING OF RESIDENCE CLAUSES UNDER ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1408/' .  THE FINAL QUESTION IS : ' HOW IS THE LAST QUESTION TO BE ANSWERED IF BILATERAL OR MULTILATERAL CONVENTIONS BETWEEN THE MEMBER STATES CONCERNED HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED RULES CORRESPONDING TO THOSE IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1408/71?  ' .   THE FIRST SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/PROVIDES : ' SAVE AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS REGULATION , INVALIDITY , OLD AGE OR SURVIVORS '  CASH BENEFITS , PENSIONS FOR ACCIDENTS AT WORK OR OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES AND DEATH GRANTS ACQUIRED UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF ONE OR MORE MEMBER STATES SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY REDUCTION , MODIFICATION , SUSPENSION , WITHDRAWAL OR CONFISCATION BY REASON OF THE FACT THAT THE RECIPIENT RESIDES IN A TERRITORY OF A MEMBER STATE OTHER THAN THAT IN WHICH THE INSTITUTION RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYMENT IS SITUATED ' .   AS THE COURT HAS ALREADY RULED , IN ITS JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER ( PETRONI , CASE 24/( ) ECR ), ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/OF THE COUNCIL IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH ARTICLE OF THE TREATY TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT IMPOSES A LIMITATION ON BENEFITS ACQUIRED IN DIFFERENT MEMBER STATES BY A REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF A BENEFIT ACQUIRED UNDER NATIONAL LEGISLATION ALONE .  ARTICLE OF THE TREATY REFERS TO TWO OBJECTIVES WHICH , ALTHOUGH CONNECTED , ARE DIFFERENT , NAMELY ( A ) AGGREGATION , FOR THE PURPOSE OF ACQUIRING THE RIGHT TO BENEFIT , OF ALL PERIODS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT UNDER THE LAWS OF THE SEVERAL COUNTRIES , AND ( B ) PAYMENTS OF BENEFITS TO PERSONS RESIDENT IN THE TERRITORIES OF MEMBER STATES .  HOWEVER , THE DECISION REFERRED TO BY THE SOZIALGERICHT RELATES SPECIFICALLY TO A BENEFIT ACQUIRED BY VIRTUE OF THE NATIONAL LEGISLATION OF A MEMBER STATE ALONE WITHOUT ITS BEING NECESSARY TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR AGGREGATION AND APPORTIONMENT AS PROVIDED FOR UNDER SUBPARAGRAPH ( A ) OF ARTICLE .    CONSEQUENTLY , THE ANSWER TO BE GIVEN TO THE FIRST TWO QUESTIONS IS THAT ARTICLE ( ) IS APPLICABLE ONLY IN CASES WHERE , FOR THE PURPOSE OF ACQUIRING THE RIGHT TO BENEFIT WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( A ) OF THE TREATY , IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR AGGREGATION OF THE PERIODS OF INSURANCE .  IT FOLLOWS FROM THE FOREGOING THAT , SINCE THE WAIVING OF RESIDENCE CLAUSES PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1408/HAS NO EFFECT ON THE ACQUISITION OF THE RIGHT TO BENEFIT , IT CANNOT INVOLVE THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THAT REGULATION .   THE ANSWERS TO THE FIRST THREE QUESTIONS MAKE IT UNNECESSARY TO ANSWER THE FOURTH .
