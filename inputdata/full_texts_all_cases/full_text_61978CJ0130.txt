IS THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY ADOPTED PURSUANT TO THE ABOVE-MENTIONED ARTICLE AND WITHIN THE FIELD INDICATED ABOVE AT . DIRECTLY APPLICABLE WITHIN THE DOMESTIC LEGAL SYSTEM OF THE MEMBER STATE IN QUESTION ( THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC ), OR , ON THE CONTRARY , IS DOMESTIC IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION NECESSARY FOR THAT PURPOSE?   . IF QUESTION IS ANSWERED IN THE WAY SUGGESTED FIRST , THAT IS , IF THE DECISION IS DIRECTLY APPLICABLE , DOES THAT DECISION BECOME APPLICABLE AT THE TIME OF ITS ADOPTION OR AT THE TIME OF ITS NOTIFICATION TO THE STATE TO WHICH IT WAS ADDRESSED?   . IF QUESTION IS ANSWERED IN THE WAY SUGGESTED FIRST , DOES THE SAID ' ' DECISION ' '  OF THE COMMISSION TAKE EFFECT , WITH REGARD TO THE ABROGATED MEASURE , AS A TECHNICAL ' ' ANNULMENT ' ' , THAT IS , DOES IT HAVE EFFECT EX TUNC FROM THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THAT MEASURE , WITHDRAWING WITH RETROACTIVE EFFECT ALL THE CONSEQUENCES THEREOF , OR DOES IT CONSTITUTE WITH REGARD TO THAT MEASURE A TECHNICAL ' ' REPEAL ' ' , THAT IS , DOES IT HAVE EFFECT EX NUNC FROM THE TIME ( OF ADOPTION OR OF NOTIFICATION ) OF THE ' ' DECISION ' '  ITSELF?   .

NAMELY FROZEN BEEF AND VEAL FOR THE PROCESSING INDUSTRY - BELONGED TO A CATEGORY WHICH WAS EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED BY THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT IN THE NOTIFICATION TO THE COMMISSION OF THE PROTECTIVE MEASURE .   15HOWEVER , IT APPEARS FROM THE FILE THAT THAT EXCEPTION WAS NOT REPEATED IN THE CIRCULAR CONCERNING THE APPLICATION OF THE PROTECTIVE MEASURE WITHIN THE DOMESTIC LEGAL ORDER .   16ACCORDING TO THE EXPLANATIONS GIVEN BY THE APPELLANT IN THE MAIN ACTION IT WAS ABLE TO LEARN OF THE TERMS OF THE NOTIFICATION ADDRESSED BY THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT TO THE COMMISSION ONLY IN THE COURSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS , WITH THE RESULT THAT THAT ARGUMENT , RAISED LATE IN THE DAY , COULD NOT BE CONSIDERED BY THE NATIONAL COURTS ALTHOUGH IT FORMS PART OF THE FILE OF THE CORTE DI CASSAZIONE .   17SHOULD IT BE ESTABLISHED THAT THE MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE ITALIAN AUTHORITIES WERE EXTENDED TO A CATEGORY OF GOODS EXCLUDED FROM THE PROTECTIVE MEASURE NOTIFIED TO THE COMMISSION , IT WOULD APPEAR THAT TO THAT EXTENT CHARGING THE SUPPLEMENTARY AMOUNT OF % OF THE LEVY CONSTITUTED A CHARGE HAVING AN EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO A CUSTOMS DUTY , THE IMPOSITION OF WHICH IS PROHIBITED BY ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 14/.    18HOWEVER , SINCE THE COURT IS NOT COMPETENT TO INVESTIGATE THE FACTS OF THE CASE AND SINCE NO QUESTION HAS BEEN SUBMITTED ON THAT MATTER , CONSIDERATION OF THE QUESTION RAISED BY THE COMMISSION MUST BE LEFT TO THE NATIONAL COURT .   19ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 14/PROVIDES THAT ' ' IF , AS A RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THE MEASURES RELATING TO THE PROGRESSIVE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN BEEF AND VEAL , SUCH MARKET SHOULD , IN ONE OR MORE MEMBER STATES , SUFFER OR BE THREATENED WITH SERIOUS DISTURBANCE DUE TO IMPORTS , LIABLE TO ENDANGER THE OBJECTIVES LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE OF THE TREATY , THE MEMBER STATE(S ) CONCERNED MAY , DURING THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD , TAKE THE NECESSARY PROTECTIVE MEASURES CONCERNING IMPORTATION OF THE PRODUCTS IN QUESTION ' ' .   20THE FIRST SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE SAID REGULATION PROVIDES THAT THE MEMBER STATE CONCERNED SHALL BE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY THE OTHER MEMBER STATES AND THE COMMISSION OF SUCH MEASURES NOT LATER THAN THE DATE OF THEIR ENTRY INTO FORCE .   21THE THIRD SUBPARAGRAPH OF THE SAID ARTICLE ( ) PROVIDES THAT , AFTER CONSULTING THE MEMBER STATES THROUGH THE COMPETENT MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE , THE COMMISSION ' ' SHALL DECIDE BY MEANS OF EMERGENCY PROCEDURE , WITHIN A MAXIMUM OF FOUR WORKING DAYS CALCULATED FROM THE NOTIFICATION REFERRED TO IN THE FIRST SUBPARAGRAPH ABOVE WHETHER THE MEASURES SHOULD BE RETAINED , AMENDED OR ABOLISHED ' ' .   22THE FOURTH SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) ADDS THAT THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION ' ' SHALL COME INTO FORCE IMMEDIATELY ' ' .   23THE DECISION TAKEN BY THE COMMISSION ON JULY BY VIRTUE OF THE AFORESAID PROVISIONS , HAVING BEEN NOTIFIED ON THE SAME DAY , TOOK EFFECT WITH REGARD TO THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC AT THE TIME OF THAT NOTIFICATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .   24THUS , AS FROM JULY , THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC WAS , WITH IMMEDIATE EFFECT , UNDER A DUTY TO ABOLISH THE PROTECTIVE MEASURES , THE INTRODUCTION OF WHICH HAD BEEN DECLARED TO THE COMMISSION ON JULY .    25CONSEQUENTLY THE ITALIAN ADMINISTRATION IS NOT ENTITLED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE PROTECTIVE MEASURE IN QUESTION AGAINST A TRADER IN RESPECT OF AN IMPORTATION WHICH TOOK PLACE AFTER THE DATE - JULY - ON WHICH THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION TOOK EFFECT WITH REGARD TO THE STATE .   26THE ITALIAN AUTHORITIES CANNOT DISPUTE THE FULL EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT DECISION BY RELYING ON THE FACT THAT THE INTERNAL MEASURES TAKEN UNDER THE PROTECTIVE MEASURE WERE NOT REPEALED UNTIL A DATE SUBSEQUENT TO THAT ON WHICH THE DECISION TOOK EFFECT .   27RELIANCE , ON THE PART OF THE NATIONAL ADMINISTRATION , ON ITS OWN DELAY IN CARRYING OUT A DECISION OF THE COMMUNITY AUTHORITY WOULD IN FACT CONSTITUTE A BREACH OF THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY WHICH PROVIDES THAT : ' ' MEMBER STATES SHALL TAKE ALL APPROPRIATE MEASURES , WHETHER GENERAL OR PARTICULAR , TO ENSURE FULFILMENT OF THE OBLIGATIONS ARISING OUT OF THIS TREATY OR RESULTING FROM ACTION TAKEN BY THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY ' ' .   28THIS CONCLUSION IS NOT INVALIDATED BY THE FACT THAT , AT THE VERY TIME WHEN THE COMMISSION REQUIRED THE ABOLITION OF A PROTECTIVE MEASURE FOR WHICH IT COULD NOT SEE ANY JUSTIFICATION , THE COUNCIL AUTHORIZED THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC TO TAKE ALTERNATIVE PROTECTIVE MEASURES .   29IN FACT THOSE MEASURES REST ON A DIFFERENT BASIS , NAMELY ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 14/, WHICH PROVIDES THAT THE COUNCIL MAY , ACTING ON A PROPOSAL FROM THE COMMISSION , TAKE ' ' MEASURES IN DEROGATION ' '  FROM THE REGULATION TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF ' ' SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES ' '  WHICH MAY EXIST IN REGARD TO CERTAIN PRODUCTS COVERED BY THAT REGULATION .   30MOREOVER , IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE DEROGATIVE MEASURES AUTHORIZED BY THE COUNCIL ON THAT BASIS DO NOT COINCIDE , EITHER IN NATURE OR IN SCOPE , WITH THE PROTECTIVE MEASURES WHICH THE COMMISSION REQUIRED TO BE ABOLISHED .   31FROM THAT IT MUST FOLLOW THAT , ALTHOUGH THE DECISION TAKEN BY THE COMMISSION UNDER ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 14/AND THE DECISION TAKEN BY THE COUNCIL UNDER ARTICLE OF THE SAME REGULATION ARE CO-EXISTENT , THERE DOES NOT EXIST ANY LEGAL CONNEXION , OR A FORTIORI ANY HIERARCHICAL RELATIONSHIP , BETWEEN THEM .   32HENCE THE USE MADE BY THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC , WITH EFFECT FROM AUGUST , OF THE AUTHORIZATION GRANTED BY THE DECISION OF THE COUNCIL CANNOT BE REGARDED AS CONSTITUTING A CONDITION PRECEDENT TO THE REMOVAL OF THE EFFECTS OF THE PROTECTIVE MEASURE AS REQUIRED BY THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION .   33THE REPLY SHOULD THEREFORE BE AS FOLLOWS :   AS REGARDS THE FIRST QUESTION , COMMISSION DECISION NO 66/, ADOPTED ON JULY UNDER ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 14/, TOOK EFFECT INDEPENDENTLY OF COUNCIL DECISION NO 66/, ADOPTED ON THE SAME DAY UNDER ARTICLE OF THE SAME REGULATION .  AS REGARDS THE SECOND QUESTION , FOLLOWING COMMISSION DECISION NO 66/THE MEMBER STATE CONCERNED IS NO LONGER ENTITLED TO RELY , AS AGAINST A TRADER , WITH REGARD TO AN IMPORTATION OCCURRING AFTER THAT DECISION TOOK EFFECT , ON THE NATIONAL PROVISIONS INTRODUCED BY VIRTUE OF THE PROTECTIVE MEASURE WHICH THE COMMISSION REQUIRED TO BE ABOLISHED , EVEN THOUGH THOSE PROVISIONS WERE NOT REPEALED WITHIN THE DOMESTIC LEGAL ORDER UNTIL AFTER THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION TOOK EFFECT .  AS REGARDS THE THIRD QUESTION , IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY , COMMISSION DECISION NO 66/TOOK EFFECT AT THE TIME OF ITS NOTIFICATION TO THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC , THAT IS , ON JULY .    34IN REPLY TO THE FOURTH QUESTION IT MAY BE STATED THAT THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 14/DO NOT LIMIT THE POWER OF THE COMMISSION AS REGARDS FIXING THE TIME FROM WHICH IT MAY , WHERE APPROPRIATE , REQUIRE THE ABOLITION OF A PROTECTIVE MEASURE INTRODUCED BY A MEMBER STATE .   35WHILST IT IS TRUE THAT IN PRINCIPLE NOTHING WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE COMMISSION FROM REQUIRING THE ABOLITION OF A PROTECTIVE MEASURE WHICH IT CONSIDERED UNJUSTIFIED AS FROM THE TIME OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THAT MEASURE , IT APPEARS FROM THE WORDING OF DECISION NO 66/THAT THE DUTY TO ABOLISH THE MEASURES IN QUESTION WAS TO TAKE EFFECT AT THE SAME TIME AS THE DECISION ITSELF , NAMELY ON THE DAY OF THE NOTIFICATION TO THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT , JULY .    36IN VIEW OF THE REPLY GIVEN TO THE SECOND QUESTION , THE FIFTH QUESTION HAS LOST ITS PURPOSE .
