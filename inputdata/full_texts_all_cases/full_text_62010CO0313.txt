ORDER OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECOND CHAMBER OF THE COURT 
October (*)
      
(Removal from the Register)
In Case C-313/10,
REFERNCE for a preliminary ruling under Article TFEU from the Landesarbeitsgericht Köln (Germany), made by decision of
         April 2010, received at the Court on June 2010, in the proceedings
      
Land Nordrhein-Westfalen
v
Sylvia Jansen,
THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECOND CHAMBER OF THE COURT,
after hearing the Advocate General, N. Jääskinen,
makes the following
Order
By letter of October 2011, received at the Registry of the Court on October 2011, the Landesarbeitsgericht Köln (Higher
         Labour Court, Cologne) informed the Court that the dispute in the main proceedings had become devoid of purpose and that,
         consequently, it was withdrawing its reference for a preliminary ruling.
      
In those circumstances, the present case must be removed from the Register of the Court.
      
Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court,
         the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs
         of those parties, are not recoverable.
      
On those grounds, the President of the Second Chamber of the Court hereby orders:
Case C‑313/is removed from the Register of the Court.
Luxembourg, October 2011.
A. Calot Escobar
 
      J.N. Cunha Rodrigues
