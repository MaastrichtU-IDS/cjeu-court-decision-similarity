Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Krajský súd v Prešove – Interpretation of Article EU and Article of the Protocol
                  to the Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, signed in Paris on March – Property
                  law – National legislation under which electrical installations may be placed on private land without the owners being entitled
                  to compensation.
               
Operative part 
The Court of Justice of the European Communities clearly has no jurisdiction to answer the questions referred by the Krajský
         súd v Prešove V by decisions of May and July 2006.
