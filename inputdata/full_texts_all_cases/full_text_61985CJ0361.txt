Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON NOVEMBER THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION, PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY, FOR A DECLARATION THAT, BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH DIRECTIVES 79/373/EEC, 80/509/EEC, 80/511/EEC AND 80/695/EEC ON THE MARKETING OF COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS, THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY .  THE DIRECTIVES IN QUESTION ARE AS FOLLOWS :  COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 79/373/EEC OF APRIL ON THE MARKETING OF COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL 1979, L*86, P.*),  COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 80/509/EEC OF MAY AMENDING THE ANNEX TO COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 79/373/EEC ON THE MARKETING OF COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL 1980, L*126, P.*),  COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 80/511/EEC OF MAY AUTHORIZING, IN CERTAIN CASES, THE MARKETING OF COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS IN UNSEALED PACKAGES OR CONTAINERS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL 1980, L*126, P.*),  COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 80/695/EEC OF JUNE AMENDING THE ANNEX TO COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 79/373/EEC ON THE MARKETING OF COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL 1980, L*188, P.*).  ARTICLE OF DIRECTIVE 79/AND ARTICLE OF DIRECTIVE 80/509, DIRECTIVE 80/AND DIRECTIVE 80/PROVIDE THAT THE MEMBER STATES ARE TO BRING INTO FORCE THE NECESSARY LAWS, REGULATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS TO ENABLE THEM TO COMPLY WITH EACH DIRECTIVE WITH EFFECT FROM JANUARY AND ARE TO INFORM THE COMMISSION THEREOF FORTHWITH .  SINCE IT RECEIVED NO COMMUNICATION FROM THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT CONCERNING MEASURES TAKEN TO TRANSPOSE THE DIRECTIVES INTO NATIONAL LAW, THE COMMISSION SENT IT FORMAL NOTICE IN A LETTER DATED DECEMBER IN WHICH IT ASKED THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT TO SUBMIT ITS OBSERVATIONS . HAVING DELIVERED A REASONED OPINION ON JUNE TO WHICH IT RECEIVED NO REPLY, THE COMMISSION BROUGHT THIS ACTION .  REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING FOR A FULLER DESCRIPTION OF THE FACTS, THE PROCEDURE AND THE SUBMISSIONS AND ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES, WHICH ARE MENTIONED OR DISCUSSED HEREINAFTER ONLY IN SO FAR AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE REASONING OF THE COURT .  THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC DOES NOT DENY THE INFRINGEMENT WITH WHICH IT IS CHARGED . HOWEVER, IT STATES THAT THE TRANSPOSITION INTO NATIONAL LAW OF THE DIRECTIVES IN QUESTION REQUIRES THE ADOPTION OF LEGISLATIVE MEASURES WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO DRAFT OWING TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SUBJECT-MATTER . IN ANY EVENT, A BILL HAS BEEN DRAWN UP WITH A VIEW TO TRANSPOSING THE DIRECTIVES IN QUESTION INTO NATIONAL LAW AND IT TRUSTS THAT THE LEGISLATION CAN BE ENACTED WITHIN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD .  IT IS APPROPRIATE TO POINT OUT THAT, ACCORDING TO WELL-ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW OF THE COURT, A MEMBER STATE MAY NOT PLEAD PROVISIONS, PRACTICES OR CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING IN ITS INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OBLIGATIONS AND TIME-LIMITS RESULTING FROM COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES .  FURTHERMORE, AS THE COURT STATED IN ITS JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER ( CASE 136/COMMISSION V ITALIAN REPUBLIC (( )) ECR ), THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE MEMBER STATES PARTICIPATE IN THE PREPARATORY WORK FOR DIRECTIVES AND MUST THEREFORE BE IN A POSITION TO PREPARE, WITHIN THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED, THE DRAFT LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS NECESSARY FOR THEIR IMPLEMENTATION .  IT MUST THEREFORE BE HELD THAT, BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH DIRECTIVES 79/373/EEC, 80/509/EEC, 80/511/EEC AND 80/695/EEC, THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS . SINCE THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED IN ITS SUBMISSIONS, IT MUST BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .  
Operative part
On those grounds,  THE COURT  hereby :  ( ) Declares that, by failing to adopt within the prescribed period the provisions necessary to comply with Council Directive 79/373/EEC of April on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs, Commission Directive 80/509/EEC of May amending the Annex to Council Directive 79/373/EEC on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs, Commission Directive 80/511/EEC of May authorizing, in certain cases, the marketing of compound feedingstuffs in unsealed packages or containers and Commission Directive 80/695/EEC of June amending the Annex to Council Directive 79/373/EEC on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs, the Italian Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under the EEC Treaty;  ( ) The Italian Republic is ordered to pay the costs .
