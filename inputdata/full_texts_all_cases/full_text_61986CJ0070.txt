Summary
APART FROM SPECIAL FEATURES OF SPECIFIC AREAS IN WHICH IT IS USED, THE CONCEPT OF FORCE MAJEURE ESSENTIALLY COVERS EXTRANEOUS CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE RELEVANT ACTION TO BE CARRIED OUT . EVEN THOUGH IT DOES NOT PRESUPPOSE ABSOLUTE IMPOSSIBILITY IT NEVERTHELESS REQUIRES ABNORMAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE WILL OF THE PERSON CONCERNED AND APPEAR INEVITABLE EVEN IF ALL DUE CARE IS TAKEN .

KAKOURIS AND F . SCHOCKWEILER ( PRESIDENTS OF CHAMBERS ), G . BOSCO, T . KOOPMANS, U . EVERLING, R . JOLIET, J . C . MOITINHO DE ALMEIDA AND G . C .

Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON MARCH THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT, BY FAILING TO ENTER IN THE COMMISSION' S ACCOUNT IN DUE TIME THE FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS FOR JUNE AND BY REFUSING TO PAY THE INTEREST PROVIDED FOR IN THE EVENT OF SUCH LATE ENTRY, THE HELLENIC REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY .  THE FIRST SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF COUNCIL REGULATION NO 2891/OF DECEMBER IMPLEMENTING THE DECISION OF APRIL ON THE REPLACEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM MEMBER STATES BY THE COMMUNITY' S OWN RESOURCES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL 1977, L*336, P.*) PROVIDES THAT "THE VAT RESOURCES OR, WHERE APPROPRIATE, THE FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS BASED ON GNP, SHALL BE ENTERED ON THE FIRST WORKING DAY OF EACH MONTH, THE AMOUNT BEING ONE-TWELFTH OF THE TOTAL RESULTING FROM THE BUDGET IN THIS CONNECTION ".  ARTICLE OF THE REGULATION STATES THAT "ANY DELAY IN MAKING THE ENTRY IN THE ACCOUNT REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE ( ) SHALL GIVE RISE TO THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST BY THE MEMBER STATE CONCERNED AT A RATE EQUAL TO THE HIGHEST RATE OF DISCOUNT RULING IN THE MEMBER STATES ON THE DUE DATE . THAT RATE SHALL BE INCREASED BY 0.OF A PERCENTAGE POINT FOR EACH MONTH OF DELAY . THE INCREASED RATE SHALL BE APPLIED TO THE ENTIRE PERIOD OF DELAY ".  THE DIRECTORATE-GENERAL FOR BUDGETS AT THE COMMISSION FOUND THAT THE FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE HELLENIC REPUBLIC FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE HAD NOT BEEN ENTERED IN THE COMMISSION' S ACCOUNT ON THE FIRST WORKING DAY OF THAT MONTH ( JUNE ) BUT TWO DAYS LATER, ON JUNE; IT THEREFORE ASKED THE HELLENIC REPUBLIC TO CREDIT ACCOUNT NO "COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES - GAO" AT THE BANK OF GREECE WITH THE INTEREST DUE PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE REGULATION ( DR*1*265*542.).  THE COMMISSION DID NOT ACCEPT THE ARGUMENT OF THE GREEK AUTHORITIES TO THE EFFECT THAT THE INTEREST IN QUESTION WAS NOT DUE INASMUCH AS THE DELAYED ENTRY WAS CAUSED BY A GENERAL STRIKE OF BANK EMPLOYEES ON AND JUNE WHICH MUST BE REGARDED AS FORCE MAJEURE; IT SENT THE GREEK GOVERNMENT A LETTER FORMALLY REQUESTING IT TO TAKE THE NECESSARY ACTION AND, SUBSEQUENTLY, A REASONED OPINION . THE GREEK GOVERNMENT STATED THAT IT MAINTAINED ITS POSITION, AND THE COMMISSION THEREFORE BROUGHT THESE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COURT .  REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING FOR THE FACTS AND THE ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES, WHICH ARE MENTIONED OR DISCUSSED HEREINAFTER ONLY IN SO FAR AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE REASONING OF THE COURT .  THE COMMISSION ACCEPTS THAT IN THE EVENT OF FORCE MAJEURE A DELAY IN THE ENTRY OF FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS DOES NOT HAVE THE EFFECT THAT THE MEMBER STATE CONCERNED IS OBLIGED TO PAY INTEREST FOR LATE PAYMENT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 2891/. IN THIS CASE, HOWEVER, THE STRIKE RELIED ON AS AN EXCUSE BY THE GREEK GOVERNMENT WAS NOT AN EVENT EXTRANEOUS TO IT AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT STRIKE WERE NOT INEVITABLE SINCE IT WAS KNOWN IN ADVANCE OR WAS AT LEAST FORESEEABLE THAT A STRIKE WOULD BE CALLED .  AS THE COURT HAS CONSISTENTLY HELD, APART FROM SPECIAL FEATURES OF SPECIFIC AREAS IN WHICH IT IS USED, THE CONCEPT OF FORCE MAJEURE ESSENTIALLY COVERS EXTRANEOUS CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE RELEVANT ACTION TO BE CARRIED OUT . EVEN THOUGH IT DOES NOT PRESUPPOSE ABSOLUTE IMPOSSIBILITY IT NEVERTHELESS REQUIRES ABNORMAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE WILL OF THE PERSON CONCERNED AND APPEAR INEVITABLE EVEN IF ALL DUE CARE IS TAKEN ( SEE MOST RECENTLY THE JUDGMENT OF JULY IN CASE 209/VALSABBIA V COMMISSION (( )) ECR ).  THOSE CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET IN THIS CASE . IT APPEARS FROM THE DOCUMENTS BEFORE THE COURT THAT AT LEAST SINCE MAY THE PRESS HAD WARNED OF STRIKES AFFECTING SEVERAL OCCUPATIONS, INCLUDING BANK EMPLOYEES, FOR AND MAY . ON MAY, THE PRESS WARNED OF FURTHER INDUSTRIAL ACTION AND STATED THAT THE UNIONS HAD CALLED A STRIKE FOR AND JUNE . THE STRIKE WHICH IN FACT TOOK PLACE ON THOSE DATES WAS THEREFORE FORESEEABLE AND THE DELAY IN THE ENTRY OF THE FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS IN QUESTION COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED .  IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO CONSIDER THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT, IN THE EVENT OF FORCE MAJEURE, THE MEMBER STATES ARE OBLIGED TO PAY INTEREST PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 2891/. THE STRIKE RELIED ON AS AN EXCUSE BY THE GREEK GOVERNMENT CANNOT BE REGARDED AS A CASE OF FORCE MAJEURE .  CONSEQUENTLY, BY FAILING TO ENTER THE FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE IN THE COMMISSION' S ACCOUNT IN DUE TIME AND BY REFUSING TO PAY INTEREST PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 2891/IN RESPECT OF THE LATE ENTRY, THE HELLENIC REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS . SINCE THE HELLENIC REPUBLIC HAS FAILED IN ITS SUBMISSIONS IT MUST BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .  
Operative part
On those grounds,  THE COURT  hereby :  ( ) Declares that, by failing to enter the financial contributions for the month of June in the Commission' s account in due time and by refusing to pay interest in respect of that late entry pursuant to Article of Regulation No 2891/77, the Hellenic Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under the Treaty;  ( ) Orders the Hellenic Republic to pay the costs .
