Subject of the case
APPLICATION PRINCIPALLY FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE PERIODIC REPORT ON THE APPLICANT FOR THE PERIOD TO AND FOR AN ORDER THAT THE DEFENDANT PAY HER FLUX BY WAY OF DAMAGES , 
Grounds
THE PRESENT APPLICATION , WHICH WAS LODGED ON MARCH , IS PRINCIPALLY FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE APPLICANT ' S PERIODIC REPORT , WHICH WAS DRAWN UP IN RESPECT OF THE PERIOD 1973/AND FOR AN ORDER THAT THE DEFENDANT SHOULD PAY SYMBOLIC DAMAGES OF ONE LUXEMBOURG FRANC .   THE REPORT IN QUESTION , DATED MARCH , BEARS THE RATING ' GOOD '  UNDER THE HEADING ' ABILITY ' , UNFAVOURABLE ASSESSMENTS WITH REGARD TO EFFICIENCY AND CONDUCT IN THE SERVICE AND A GENERAL REPORT WHICH IS ALSO UNFAVOURABLE .   BECAUSE THESE ASSESSMENTS DID NOT CORRESPOND TO THOSE CONTAINED IN THE PRECEDING REPORTS , THE APPLICANT DESCRIBED THEM IN HER OBSERVATIONS ON THAT REPORT AS ' SERIOUS ACTS OF ABUSE OF POWERS BY A DIRECTOR GENERAL IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES ' .   A REPLY IN THE AFFIRMATIVE WAS GIVEN TO THE QUESTION PUT BY THE COURT TO THE DEFENDANT AS TO WHETHER THE COMPETENT DIRECTOR GENERAL HAD REPLIED TO THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE APPLICANT ON THAT REPORT BEFORE THE PERIODIC REPORT IN QUESTION WAS SIGNED , AS IS OBLIGATORY , BY THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PARLIAMENT .  ADMISSIBILITY   THE DEFENDANT ALLEGES FIRST OF ALL THAT A PERIODIC REPORT CANNOT BE AN ACT WHICH MAY BE CONTESTED UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS BECAUSE IT IS ONLY A PURELY INTERNAL ACT THE REMEDIES FOR WHICH LIE SOLELY IN THE RIGHT OF THE PERSON AFFECTED TO ADD ANY OBJECTIONS AND OBSERVATIONS .   SINCE ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS PROVIDES FOR THE MAKING OF A PERIODIC REPORT EVERY TWO YEARS THESE ARE THUS MANDATORY MEASURES WHICH MUST BE COMMUNICATED TO THE PERSON CONCERNED .   IT IS CLEAR THAT THESE PERIODIC REPORTS GENERALLY CONSTITUTE A MORE OR LESS IMPORTANT FACTOR EACH TIME THE OFFICIAL CONCERNED IS CONSIDERED FOR ANY PROMOTION OR TAKES PART IN COMPETITIONS WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT THESE REPORTS ARE MADE UP OF ASSESSMENTS WHICH IT IS DIFFICULT FOR A COURT TO REVIEW , THIS FACT DOES NOT PREVENT THEIR ADOPTION FROM BEING VITIATED FOR LACK OF AUTHORITY , IRREGULARITY OF FORM AND PROCEDURE OR PATENT ERROR AND MISUSE OF DISCRETIONARY POWER - DEFECTS CAPABLE OF MAKING THEM UNLAWFUL .   ACCORDINGLY THE ARGUMENT THAT AN APPLICATION AGAINST A PERIODIC REPORT IS IPSO FACTO INADMISSIBLE CANNOT BE ACCEPTED .   THE DEFENDANT PUTS FORWARD IN THE ALTERNATIVE THE ARGUMENT THAT THE REPORT WAS NOTIFIED TO THE APPLICANT ON APRIL AT THE LATEST , SO THAT HER COMPLAINT THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS LODGED ON OCTOBER WAS OUT OF TIME .   THE REPORT IN QUESTION WAS COUNTERSIGNED BY THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PARLIAMENT ON OCTOBER IN THE FORM IN WHICH IT HAD BEEN COMMUNICATED TO THE APPLICANT .   IT BECAME DEFINITIVE ONLY ON THAT DATE .   ACCORDINGLY , THE FACT THAT THE APPLICANT , IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURE PRESCRIBED FOR THE DRAWING UP OF PERIODIC REPORTS , HAD KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONTENTS BEFORE THAT DATE IS NOT CAPABLE OF CAUSING THE PERIOD FOR LODGING AN APPEAL TO START TO RUN OR OF SHORTENING IT .   THE APPLICATION IS THEREFORE ADMISSIBLE .  THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CASE   THE APPLICANT CONSIDERS THAT THE REPORT IS ILLEGAL FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE IT WAS DRAWN UP BY THE VERY PERSON AGAINST WHOM SHE HAD ALREADY SUBMITTED HER COMPLAINT THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS IN A PREVIOUS CASE ( CASE 66/, ( ) ECR ).   SHE CLAIMS THAT IN SO DOING , THE DIRECTOR GENERAL IS MAKING HIMSELF JUDGE AND WITNESS IN HIS OWN CAUSE .   THE APPLICANT HAS PUT FORWARD NO FACTOR WHICH IS CAPABLE OF PROVING THAT THE PERSON MAKING THE REPORT WAS NOT IMPARTIAL AND SOUGHT BY HIS ASSESSMENTS ADVERSELY TO AFFECT THE APPLICANT ' S CAREER .   ON THE CONTRARY IT APPEARS FROM THE FILE THAT THE PERSON CONCERNED HAS SHOWN THAT AT LEAST HER ' CONDUCT '  LEFT MUCH TO BE DESIRED THROUGH HER REFUSAL TO COOPERATE WITH THE MEASURES PUT IN HAND FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE REORGANIZATION OF THE SERVICE .   FOR THESE REASONS , THE FIRST SUBMISSION CANNOT BE ACCEPTED .   THE APPLICANT SECONDLY ALLEGES A MISUSE OF POWERS INASMUCH AS , WHILE THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE REPORT TENDED TO SHOW HER INEFFICIENCY , IMPORTANT DUTIES WERE STILL ENTRUSTED TO HER .   THIS FACT IS NOT BY ITSELF CAPABLE OF ESTABLISHING A MISUSE OF POWERS .   IT APPEARS FROM THE PROCEEDINGS THAT THE SECRETARY GENERAL ONLY SIGNED THE REPORT ON OCTOBER .    IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE COURT TO EXAMINE OF ITS OWN MOTION WHETHER THIS DELAY IS SUCH AS TO MAKE THE REPORT LEGALLY VOID .   A PERIODIC REPORT MUST BE DRAWN UP IN RESPECT OF EVERY TWO-YEAR PERIOD AND SIGNED BY THE SECRETARY GENERAL .   THE EXPLANATIONS SUPPLIED BY THE DEFENDANT CONCERNING INTER ALIA THE SPECIAL VICISSITUDES ARISING FROM THE LODGING OF TWO SUCCESSIVE APPLICATIONS OVERLAPPING IN TIME ARE HOWEVER CONVINCING AND ENABLE THE COURT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DELAY OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PARLIAMENT IN COUNTERSIGNING IS EXPLAINED BY HIS CONCERN TO OBTAIN FROM THE DIRECTOR GENERAL A REPLY TO THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE APPLICANT .   THEREFORE THE PERIODIC REPORT IS NOT VITIATED BY THE FACT THAT THE SIGNATURE OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL WAS BELATEDLY GIVEN .   THE APPLICATION MUST THEREFORE BE DISMISSED AS UNFOUNDED .
