BOSCO, PRESIDENT OF CHAMBER, R . JOLIET AND F . SCHOCKWEILER, JUDGES,  ADVOCATE GENERAL : G . F . MANCINI  REGISTRAR : D . LOUTERMAN, ADMINISTRATOR  AFTER HEARING THE VIEWS OF THE ADVOCATE GENERAL,  MAKES THE FOLLOWING  ORDER  
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON SEPTEMBER 1987, MICHELE GIUBILINI, A FORMER MEMBER OF THE COMMISSION' S AUXILIARY STAFF EMPLOYED AT THE JOINT RESEARCH CENTRE, ISPRA, BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE MEASURE WHEREBY THE COMMISSION TERMINATED HIS CONTRACT AS A MEMBER OF THE AUXILIARY STAFF WAS UNLAWFUL, A DECLARATION THAT HIS STATUS IS THAT OF A MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF AND AN ORDER REQUIRING THE COMMISSION TO COMPENSATE HIM FOR THE DAMAGE SUFFERED .  BY A CONTRACT DATED FEBRUARY 1986, MR GIUBILINI WAS RECRUITED BY THE COMMISSION AS A MEMBER OF THE AUXILIARY STAFF FOR A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS FROM MARCH TO SEPTEMBER IN ORDER TO OCCUPY A POST AS A SKILLED WORKER AT THE JOINT RESEARCH CENTRE AT ISPRA . HIS CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT WAS RENEWED FOR A FURTHER PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS, AND TERMINATED ON MARCH .  TAKING THE VIEW THAT HE WAS DOING THE WORK OF A MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF WHO WAS EXEMPTED FROM THE SERVICE FOR REASONS OF HEALTH, MR GIUBILINI WROTE A LETTER TO THE COMMISSION ON FEBRUARY IN WHICH HE MAINTAINED THAT HIS CONTRACT AS A MEMBER OF THE AUXILIARY STAFF WAS UNLAWFUL AND SHOULD BE AMENDED IN CONFORMITY WITH THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  BY DECISION OF JULY THE COMMISSION REJECTED MR GIUBILINI' S ALLEGATIONS AND DREW HIS ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THE COMPLAINT HAD NOT BEEN SUBMITTED WITHIN THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD PRESCRIBED BY ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT .  MR GIUBILINI BROUGHT THIS ACTION AGAINST THAT DECISION .  THE COMMISSION RAISED AN OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY AGAINST THE APPLICATION AND CONTENDED THAT THE MEASURE ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE APPLICANT WAS HIS INITIAL CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT AS A MEMBER OF THE AUXILIARY STAFF AND ITS SUBSEQUENT RENEWAL, AND THAT HE SHOULD HAVE LODGED HIS COMPLAINT WITHIN THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD PRESCRIBED BY ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS, WHICH STARTED TO RUN FROM THE DATE ON WHICH THE CONTRACT WAS CONCLUDED .  IN HIS REPLY, THE APPLICANT STATED THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO APPROACH THE COMMISSION UNTIL HE BECAME AWARE THAT HIS SITUATION WAS UNLAWFUL, THAT IS TO SAY UNTIL HE LEARNED OF THE COMMISSION' S REFUSAL TO RENEW HIS CONTRACT . MOREOVER, HE MAINTAINS THAT HIS LETTER OF FEBRUARY DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A COMPLAINT WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS BUT A REQUEST WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) THEREOF .  IN THAT REGARD, IT MUST BE STATED THAT THE LETTER OF FEBRUARY CONSTITUTES A COMPLAINT WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS, INASMUCH AS THE APPLICANT CHALLENGES, IN SUBSTANCE, THE STATUS OF MEMBER OF THE AUXILIARY STAFF WHICH HAD BEEN CONFERRED ON HIM BY THE CONTRACT .  THAT DESCRIPTION OF HIS STATUS HAD BEEN EXPRESSLY AGREED UPON IN THE INITIAL CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT AND, IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY ALTERATION OF THAT DESCRIPTION, IN PARTICULAR WHEN THE CONTRACT WAS RENEWED, THE INITIAL CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT MUST BE REGARDED AS THE ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE APPLICANT ( SEE THE JUDGMENT OF JULY IN CASE 329/CASTAGNOLI (( )) ECR ).  IN ORDER FOR THE APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT TO BE ADMISSIBLE, THE COMPLAINT MUST, AS THE COURT DECIDED IN ITS JUDGMENT OF JULY IN CASE 329/85, HAVE BEEN LODGED WITHIN THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD LAID DOWN BY ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS FOLLOWING THE ADOPTION OF THE ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE APPLICANT, THAT IS TO SAY HIS CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT AS A MEMBER OF THE AUXILIARY STAFF WHICH WAS CONCLUDED ON FEBRUARY AND ENTERED INTO FORCE ON MARCH .  IT MUST BE HELD THAT, SINCE THE APPLICANT DID NOT LODGE HIS COMPLAINT UNTIL FEBRUARY 1987, THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD LAID DOWN BY ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS WAS NOT COMPLIED WITH .  THE APPLICATION MUST THEREFORE BE DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE .
