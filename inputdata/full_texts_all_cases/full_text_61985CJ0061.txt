Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON MARCH MRS TAMARA URHAUSEN, NEE VON NEUHOFF VON DER LEY, OF GERMAN NATIONALITY, AN OFFICIAL OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES SINCE APRIL AND EMPLOYED IN LUXEMBOURG, BROUGHT AN ACTION PRIMARILY FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE EXPATRIATION ALLOWANCE PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE 4*(1)*(A ) OF ANNEX VII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES .  UNDER THAT PROVISION THE EXPATRIATION ALLOWANCE IS PAID "TO OFFICIALS WHO ARE NOT AND HAVE NEVER BEEN NATIONALS OF THE STATE IN WHOSE TERRITORY THE PLACE WHERE THEY ARE EMPLOYED IS SITUATED, AND WHO DURING THE FIVE YEARS ENDING SIX MONTHS BEFORE THEY ENTER THE SERVICE", IN THIS CASE, BETWEEN NOVEMBER AND NOVEMBER 1983, "DID NOT HABITUALLY RESIDE OR CARRY ON THEIR MAIN OCCUPATION WITHIN THE EUROPEAN TERRITORY OF THAT STATE ".  IT APPEARS FROM THE DOCUMENTS BEFORE THE COURT THAT THE APPLICANT WENT TO LIVE WITH HER MOTHER IN THE GRAND DUCHY OF LUXEMBOURG AFTER HER PARENTS DIVORCED IN . FROM SEPTEMBER UNTIL JULY SHE STUDIED TRANSLATION AND INTERPRETING IN INNSBRUCK, AUSTRIA . IN SEPTEMBER SHE MARRIED A LUXEMBOURG NATIONAL, AND FROM THEN UNTIL FEBRUARY SHE TAUGHT IN A PRIMARY SCHOOL IN LUXEMBOURG . IN NOVEMBER SHE HAD HER NAME PLACED ON THE LIST OF COURT EXPERTS IN LUXEMBOURG . FROM FEBRUARY ONWARDS SHE WORKED AS A TRANSLATOR IN LUXEMBOURG, FIRST AS A TRAINEE AT THE COMMISSION AND THEN AS A FREE-LANCE TERMINOLOGIST UNTIL HER APPOINTMENT AS AN OFFICIAL ON APRIL .  DURING THAT PERIOD THE APPLICANT GAVE AS HER ADDRESS, IN HER FREE-LANCE CONTRACT WITH THE COMMISSION, THE CITY OF LUXEMBOURG . IN HER APPLICATION FOR EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMMISSION IN LUXEMBOURG SHE GAVE AN ADDRESS FOR CORRESPONDENCE IN THE CITY OF LUXEMBOURG AND INDICATED AS HER PERMANENT RESIDENCE BOTH HER PROPERTY IN MUNICH AND HER ADDRESS IN LUXEMBOURG . FURTHERMORE, THE APPLICANT WAS INCLUDED IN THE REGISTER OF INHABITANTS OF LUXEMBOURG WITHOUT INTERRUPTION UNTIL THE DATE OF HER RECRUITMENT TO THE COMMISSION .  REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING FOR A MORE DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE FACTS OF THE CASE AND THE ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES, WHICH ARE MENTIONED OR DISCUSSED HEREINAFTER ONLY IN SO FAR AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE REASONING OF THE COURT .  THE APPLICANT SUBMITS THAT BY FAILING TO GRANT HER THE EXPATRIATION ALLOWANCE THE COMMISSION HAS FAILED TO COMPLY WITH ARTICLE 4*(1)*(A ) OF ANNEX VII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  THAT SUBMISSION CANNOT BE UPHELD . THE COURT HAS REPEATEDLY HELD THAT THE OBJECT OF THE EXPATRIATION ALLOWANCE IS TO COMPENSATE OFFICIALS FOR THE EXTRA EXPENSE AND INCONVENIENCE OF TAKING UP EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMMUNITIES AND BEING THEREBY OBLIGED TO CHANGE THEIR RESIDENCE AND MOVE TO THE COUNTRY OF EMPLOYMENT ( SEE THE JUDGMENT OF NOVEMBER IN CASE 330/RICHTER V COMMISSION (( )) ECR AT P . ). FURTHERMORE, THE COURT HAS CONSISTENTLY HELD THAT THE CONCEPT OF EXPATRIATION ALSO DEPENDS ON THE PERSONAL POSITION OF AN OFFICIAL, THAT IS TO SAY ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH HE IS INTEGRATED IN HIS NEW ENVIRONMENT, WHICH IS DEMONSTRATED, FOR EXAMPLE, BY HABITUAL RESIDENCE OR BY THE MAIN OCCUPATION PURSUED ( SEE THE JUDGMENT OF MAY IN CASE 246/DE ANGELIS V COMMISSION (( )) ECR AT P . ). THUS THE APPLICANT CAN CLAIM THE ALLOWANCE IN QUESTION ONLY IF SHE NEITHER HABITUALLY RESIDED NOR CARRIED ON HER MAIN OCCUPATION ON LUXEMBOURG TERRITORY DURING THE PERIOD FROM NOVEMBER TO NOVEMBER .  IN THIS CASE IT IS SUFFICIENT TO NOTE THAT FROM SEPTEMBER ONWARDS THE APPLICANT CARRIED ON HER MAIN OCCUPATION IN LUXEMBOURG, FIRST OF ALL AS A TEACHER, THEN AS A TRAINEE TRANSLATOR AT THE COMMISSION AND FINALLY AS A FREE-LANCE TERMINOLOGIST UNTIL APRIL . IT APPEARS FROM THE APPLICANT' S OWN STATEMENTS THAT SHE CARRIED ON NO OTHER OCCUPATION DURING THAT PERIOD . MOREOVER, IT APPEARS FROM THE DOCUMENTS BEFORE THE COURT THAT THE APPLICANT NOT ONLY RENTED AN APARTMENT IN LUXEMBOURG DURING THAT PERIOD BUT, IN HER APPLICATION FOR EMPLOYMENT, GAVE LUXEMBOURG BOTH AS HER PERMANENT RESIDENCE AND AS HER ADDRESS FOR CORRESPONDENCE . SHE DOES NOT DENY THAT SHE WAS PHYSICALLY PRESENT IN LUXEMBOURG DURING THAT PERIOD .  IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THE FACT THAT THE APPLICANT STUDIED IN INNSBRUCK FROM NOVEMBER TO JULY AND MAINTAINED A RESIDENCE IN GERMANY DURING THE REFERENCE PERIOD IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR HER TO BE REGARDED AS HAVING HABITUALLY RESIDED OUTSIDE LUXEMBOURG DURING THAT PERIOD .  THE APPLICATION MUST THEREFORE BE DISMISSED .
