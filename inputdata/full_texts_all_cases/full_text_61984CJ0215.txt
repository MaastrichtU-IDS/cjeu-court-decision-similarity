IN CASE 215/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE TRIBUNAL DE GRANDE INSTANCE ( REGIONAL COURT ), VERSAILLES , FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BEFORE THAT COURT BY  PROCUREUR DE LA REPUBLIQUE ( PUBLIC PROSECUTOR )   AND THE FOLLOWING CIVIL PARTIES :   SYNDICAT NATIONAL DES GERANTS LIBRES ( SNGL ) ( NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT MANAGERS ),   CHAMBRE SYNDICALE NATIONALE DU COMMERCE ET DE LA REPARATION AUTOMOBILE ( CSNCRA ) ( NATIONAL AUTOMOBILE TRADE AND REPAIR ASSOCIATION ),   BERNARD THOMAS , JACQUES BRUNEAU , MICHEL LE BRETON , PIERRE PARENT , GERARD GUILLEMIN , GUY LOISELIER , EDUARD SZELAG ,   AGAINST  MARIE-HELENE FEREY , NEE HERICOTTE ,   AND SOCIETE ERG AS DEFENDANT IN THE CIVIL PROCEEDINGS ,   
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLES ( F ), , , AND OF THE EEC TREATY , 
Grounds
BY JUDGMENT OF JULY , WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON AUGUST , THE TRIBUNAL DE GRANDE INSTANCE ( REGIONAL COURT ), VERSAILLES , REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY A QUESTION CONCERNING THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLES ( F ), , , AND OF THE EEC TREATY , IN ORDER TO ENABLE IT TO DETERMINE WHETHER NATIONAL RULES IMPOSING A MINIMUM PRICE ON THE SALE OF FUEL TO CONSUMERS ARE COMPATIBLE WITH COMMUNITY LAW .  THE QUESTION WAS RAISED IN THE CONTEXT OF CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT AGAINST MARIE-HELENE FEREY NEE HERICOTTE IN HER CAPACITY AS MANAGING DIRECTOR OF ERG CARBURANTS SA WHICH OPERATES PETROL STATIONS . MARIE-HELENE FEREY IS CHARGED WITH HAVING , IN AUGUST AND DECEMBER , OFFERED FUEL FOR SALE AT PRICES BELOW THE MINIMUM PRICES FIXED BY THE RULES WHICH WERE IN FORCE AT THAT TIME .  THE ACCUSED DID NOT DISPUTE THE SUBSTANCE OF THE FACTS ALLEGED AGAINST HER BUT ASKED TO BE ACQUITTED ON THE GROUND THAT THE MINIMUM PRICES WHICH SHE HAD FAILED TO APPLY WERE BASED ON MINISTERIAL DECREES NOS 82-13/A OF APRIL AND 83-58/A OF NOVEMBER CONCERNING MINIMUM RETAIL SELLING PRICES FOR FUEL , THE PROVISIONS OF WHICH , SHE MAINTAINED , WERE IN CONFLICT WITH COMMUNITY LAW .  IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THE TRIBUNAL DE GRANDE INSTANCE , VERSAILLES , CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO REFER TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE THE FOLLOWING QUESTION FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING :    ' MUST ARTICLES ( F ), , , AND OF THE EEC TREATY OF MARCH BE INTERPRETED AS PROHIBITING THE ADOPTION BY A MEMBER STATE OF LEGISLATION OR RULES INTRODUCING A MINIMUM-PRICE SYSTEM FOR THE RETAIL SALE OF ' ' REGULAR ' '  AND ' ' SUPER ' '  PETROL?  '  THE QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLES ( F ), , , AND OF THE EEC TREATY HAVE ALREADY BEEN EXAMINED BY THE COURT IN ITS JUDGMENT OF JANUARY IN CASE 231/( CULLET V CENTRE LECLERC TOULOUSE ( ) ECR ). THE PRICE SYSTEM AT ISSUE IN THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS IS THE SAME AS THAT WHICH GAVE RISE TO CASE 231/, EXCEPT THAT MINISTERIAL DECREE NO 83-58/A OF NOVEMBER , WHICH IS APPLICABLE TO PART OF THE FACTS OF THIS CASE , INCREASED , WITH REGARD TO REGULAR AND SUPER-GRADE PETROL , THE MARGIN WITHIN WHICH THE MINIMUM RETAIL SELLING PRICE FIXED UNDER THE RULES IN FORCE COULD BE REDUCED . HOWEVER , WITH REGARD TO THE APPLICATION OF COMMUNITY LAW , THAT FACTOR DOES NOT RAISE PROBLEMS WHICH DIFFER FROM THOSE RESOLVED BY THE AFOREMENTIONED JUDGMENT OF JANUARY .   IN THAT JUDGMENT THE COURT CAME TO THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS :   ARTICLES ( F ), , AND OF THE EEC TREATY DO NOT PROHIBIT NATIONAL RULES PROVIDING FOR A MINIMUM PRICE TO BE FIXED BY THE NATIONAL AUTHORITIES FOR THE RETAIL SALE OF FUEL ;  ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY PROHIBITS SUCH RULES WHERE THE MINIMUM PRICE IS FIXED ON THE BASIS SOLELY OF THE EX-REFINERY PRICES OF THE NATIONAL REFINERIES AND WHERE THOSE EX-REFINERY PRICES ARE IN TURN LINKED TO THE CEILING PRICE WHICH IS CALCULATED ON THE BASIS SOLELY OF THE COST PRICES OF NATIONAL REFINERIES WHEN THE EUROPEAN FUEL RATES ARE MORE THAN 8% ABOVE OR BELOW THOSE PRICES .  SINCE THERE APPEARS TO BE NO NEW FACTOR IN THIS CASE REFERENCE SHOULD BE MADE , WITH REGARD TO THE REPLIES TO BE GIVEN TO THE TRIBUNAL DE GRANDE INSTANCE , VERSAILLES , AND TO THE CONSIDERATIONS WHICH LED TO THOSE REPLIES , TO THE TEXT OF THE AFOREMENTIONED JUDGMENT OF JANUARY , A COPY OF WHICH IS ANNEXED HERETO .

ON THOSE GROUNDS ,
