THE COUNCIL CONTENDS THAT , AS FAR AS IT IS CONCERNED , THE APPLICATION SHOULD BE DECLARED INADMISSIBLE WITHOUT ANY CONSIDERATION OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CASE .  THE FACT THAT THE APPLICANT FIRST OF ALL BY A PERSONAL COMMUNICATION ADDRESSED TO THE COUNCIL AND SUBSEQUENTLY IN HIS APPLICATION DIRECTED AGAINST THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION RELATING TO THE CALCULATION OF HIS SEVERANCE GRANT CALLED IN QUESTION THE VALIDITY OF CERTAIN OF THE PROVISIONS OF COUNCIL REGULATION NO 3177/DOES NOT CONFER UPON THE COUNCIL THE ATTRIBUTES OF AN APPOINTING AUTHORITY WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE SAID STAFF REGULATIONS .  ON THE OTHER HAND , SINCE REGULATION NO 3177/IS NEITHER A DECISION ADDRESSED TO THE APPLICANT NOR A DECISION WHICH , ALTHOUGH IN THE FORM OF A REGULATION , IS OF DIRECT AND INDIVIDUAL CONCERN TO HIM , THE APPLICATION IS ALSO INADMISSIBLE IN SO FAR AS IT IS BASED ON ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .  FINALLY , AND IN ANY EVENT , EVEN IF THE LETTER SENT BY THE APPLICANT TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL ON FEBRUARY IN ORDER TO HAVE REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 3177/AMENDED OR TO HAVE ARTICLE OF ANNEX VIII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS INTERPRETED BY THE COMMISSION TO HIS SATISFACTION COULD BE REGARDED AS A COMPLAINT WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , THE ACTION DIRECTED AGAINST THE REASONED REPLY OF THE COUNCIL OF MARCH IS INADMISSIBLE BECAUSE IT IS OUT OF TIME UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .
