First subparagraph of Article 104(3) of the Rules of Procedure – Freedom to provide services – Articles EC to EC – Motor vehicles – Use in one Member State of a motor vehicle registered and hired in another Member State – Taxation of that vehicle in the first Member State upon its first use on the national road network

Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Rechtbank Breda – Interpretation of Articles TFEU to TFEU – National legislation
                  providing for a registration tax to be levied upon a vehicle’s first being used on the national road network.
               
Operative part 
Articles EC to EC must be interpreted as precluding national rules, such as those at issue in the main proceedings,
         by virtue of which a person, residing or established in a Member State, who uses in that Member State a motor vehicle registered
         and leased in another Member State must, on first using that vehicle on the first Member State’s road network, pay the full
         amount of a tax the balance of which, computed relative to the period for which that vehicle was used on that network, is
         repaid, without interest, once that use has come to an end.
