IN CASE 58/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE COUR DU TRAVAIL ( LABOUR COURT ), LIEGE , FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  OFFICE NATIONAL DES PENSIONS POUR TRAVAILLEURS SALARIES ( ONPTS ) ( NATIONAL PENSION OFFICE FOR EMPLOYED PERSONS )   AND  FRANCESCO ROMANO  
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLES AND OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1408/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE APPLICATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEMES TO EMPLOYED PERSONS AND THEIR FAMILIES MOVING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P . ) AND OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 574/OF THE COUNCIL OF MARCH FIXING THE PROCEDURE FOR IMPLEMENTING REGULATION NO 1408/( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ), 
Grounds
BY JUDGMENT OF FEBRUARY WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON MARCH , THE COUR DU TRAVAIL ( LABOUR COURT ) LIEGE , REFERRED TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY THREE QUESTIONS ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLES AND OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1408/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE APPLICATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEMES TO EMPLOYED PERSONS AND THEIR FAMILIES MOVING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P . ) AND OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 574/OF THE COUNCIL OF MARCH FIXING THE PROCEDURE FOR IMPLEMENTING REGULATION NO 1408/( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ).  THOSE QUESTIONS WERE RAISED IN A DISPUTE CONCERNING THE REFUSAL OF THE OFFICE NATIONAL DES PENSIONS POUR TRAVAILLEURS SALARIES ( ONPTS ) ( NATIONAL PENSION OFFICE FOR EMPLOYED PERSONS , HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' THE OFFICE ' ) TO AWARD F . ROMANO , A FORMER MINER OF ITALIAN NATIONALITY , A FULL PENSION OF 30/30THS ON THE GROUND THAT HE RECEIVED PARTIAL PENSIONS IN RESPECT OF PERIODS OF EMPLOYMENT COMPLETED IN ITALY AND IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY .  IT IS CLEAR FROM THE DOCUMENTS FORWARDED TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE BY THE COUR DU TRAVAIL THAT , FOLLOWING THE AMENDMENT ON APRIL OF THE FIRST SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF BELGIAN ROYAL DECREE NO OF OCTOBER , A PERSON WHO HAS WORKED AS AN UNDERGROUND COALMINER FOR YEARS IS ENTITLED TO A FULL PENSION OF 30/30THS . THE FIVE ADDITIONAL YEARS OF NOTIONAL EMPLOYMENT FROM WHICH HE BENEFITS ARE NOT LOCALIZED IN TIME . HOWEVER , THE OFFICE ' S PRACTICE WAS TO REDUCE THE BENEFIT OF THOSE YEARS OF NOTIONAL EMPLOYMENT BY THE NUMBER OF YEARS OF ACTUAL EMPLOYMENT IN ANOTHER MEMBER STATE . THAT PRACTICE WAS BASED ON THE LAW OF FEBRUARY WHICH ENTERED INTO FORCE RETROACTIVELY ON JANUARY AND WHICH PROVIDES FOR A REDUCTION OF THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL YEARS THUS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE CASE OF A MINER BY THE NUMBER OF YEARS IN RESPECT OF WHICH HE CAN CLAIM A PENSION UNDER ANOTHER BELGIAN SCHEME , EXCLUDING THE SCHEME FOR SELF-EMPLOYED WORKERS , OR UNDER A SCHEME IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY .  MR ROMANO WAS EMPLOYED IN ITALY AND IN GERMANY BEFORE HIS EMPLOYMENT IN BELGIUM , FROM OCTOBER TO FEBRUARY , AS A MINEWORKER UNDERGROUND . FROM MARCH TO DECEMBER HE RECEIVED INVALIDITY BENEFITS AS AN UNDERGROUND MINER . SINCE THE RELEVANT BELGIAN LEGISLATION TREATS THE LATTER PERIOD AS A PERIOD OF ACTUAL EMPLOYMENT , MR ROMANO WAS ABLE TO CLAIM AN EMPLOYMENT RECORD SPANNING YEARS . ON JANUARY HE RETIRED . THE PENSION PAID TO HIM FROM JANUARY TO MARCH DOES NOT GIVE RISE TO ANY DISPUTE . AS REGARDS THE PERIOD AFTER APRIL , THE OFFICE ESTABLISHED , BY DECISION OF OCTOBER , THAT MR ROMANO COULD CLAIM AN EMPLOYMENT RECORD SPANNING YEARS FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE FIRST SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF BELGIAN ROYAL DECREE NO WITH A VIEW TO OBTAINING A FULL PENSION , WHICH IT REDUCED HOWEVER , IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS CONSISTENT PRACTICE , BY 5/30THS CORRESPONDING TO THE FIVE ADDITIONAL YEARS OF NOTIONAL EMPLOYMENT ON THE GROUND THAT THOSE YEARS COINCIDED WITH THE YEARS OF ACTUAL EMPLOYMENT IN ITALY AND GERMANY .  MR ROMANO CHALLENGED THE OFFICE ' S DECISION BEFORE THE COMPETENT NATIONAL COURTS . WHEN THE DISPUTE CAME BEFORE IT ON APPEAL , THE COUR DU TRAVAIL , LIEGE , CONSIDERED THAT AS REGARDS THE PERIOD PRECEDING THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED LAW , THERE WAS NO BASIS UNDER NATIONAL LAW FOR REDUCING MR ROMANO ' S BELGIAN MINER ' S PENSION . HOWEVER , IT RAISED THE QUESTION WHETHER THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE LAW OF FEBRUARY WAS CAPABLE OF ALTERING THE ASSESSMENT OF THE RELEVANT ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE MADE BY THE COURT OF JUSTICE IN ITS JUDGMENT OF JULY IN JOINED CASES , , , AND 121/ONPTS V CELESTRE ( ) ECR . ACCORDINGLY , THE NATIONAL COURT REFERRED THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING :    ' ( ) IN VIEW OF THE INCLUSION OF NEW WORDING :    ( A ) IN SUBPARAGRAPH ( ) OF ARTICLE ( ) OF ROYAL DECREE NO OF OCTOBER BY ARTICLE OF THE LAW OF FEBRUARY ;   ( B)IN THE ROYAL DECREE OF DECEMBER BY THE ADDITION OF ARTICLE QUINQUE BY ARTICLE OF THE ROYAL DECREE OF MARCH , DOES SUBPARAGRAPH ( ) OF ARTICLE ( ), THUS SUPPLEMENTED , CONSTITUTE A RULE AGAINST OVERLAPPING BENEFITS WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1408/71?    ( 2)IN THE EVENT OF AN AFFIRMATIVE ANSWER TO QUESTION , IS THE RULE THUS LAID DOWN BY THE SAID NEW SUBPARAGRAPH ( ) OF ARTICLE ( ) COMPATIBLE WITH THE TREATY OF ROME AND WITH THE COMMUNITY REGULATIONS CONCERNED , IN PARTICULAR REGULATIONS NOS 1408/AND 574/72?    ( 3)IS IT APPROPRIATE TO APPLY ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/, ON THE BASIS OF ARTICLE ( ), AND ACCORDING TO WHAT PROVISIONS OR PROCEDURES IN THE SPECIFIC CASE OF THE RESPONDENT , IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE NEW RULES RESULTING FROM THE LAW OF FEBRUARY AND THE ROYAL DECREE OF MARCH AND THE INTERPRETATION GIVEN TO THE JUDGMENT IN THE CELESTRE CASE OF JULY BY THE APPELLANT WHICH REITERATES THE VIEW THAT THE PROVISIONS AGAINST OVERLAPPING BENEFITS APPLY ONLY IF THE PENSION IS CALCULATED AND AWARDED UNDER ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) AND ( B ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/71?  '  THE QUESTIONS REFERRED TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE BY THE COUR DU TRAVAIL , LIEGE , ARE CONCERNED WITH A PROBLEM INVOLVING THE INTERPRETATION OF COMMUNITY LAW AND ARE DESIGNED ESSENTIALLY TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER A NATIONAL PROVISION WHICH REDUCES THE ADDITIONAL YEARS OF NOTIONAL EMPLOYMENT FROM WHICH A WORKER MAY BENEFIT BY THE NUMBER OF YEARS IN RESPECT OF WHICH HE MAY CLAIM A PENSION IN ANOTHER MEMBER STATE CONSTITUTES A PROVISION FOR REDUCTION OF BENEFIT WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/WHICH , BY VIRTUE OF THE LAST SENTENCE OF ARTICLE ( ), IS NOT TO BE APPLIED WHEN THE AMOUNT OF THE PENSION IS CALCULATED UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THAT REGULATION .  THE OFFICE CONTENDS THAT ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/CANNOT BE RELIED UPON IN THE CASE OF A BENEFIT AWARDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE ( ) OF THAT REGULATION . THE TITLE OF ARTICLE IS ' PREVENTION OF OVERLAPPING OF BENEFITS '  WHILST , ACCORDING TO THE OFFICE , ARTICLE ( ) AUTHORIZES A STATE TO DETERMINE THE PERIODS OF INSURANCE OR RESIDENCE TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN PURSUANCE OF ITS LEGISLATION . THE POWER OF THE NATIONAL LEGISLATURES TO DETERMINE PERIODS OF INSURANCE IS ALSO CONFIRMED BY ARTICLE ( R ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/. THE OFFICE TAKES THE VIEW THAT ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/REFERS EXCLUSIVELY TO BENEFITS , NOT TO PERIODS OF INSURANCE . IT FOLLOWS , IN ITS VIEW , THAT WHEN ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/IS APPLIED , ACCOUNT MUST BE TAKEN OF A NATIONAL PROVISION WHICH REDUCES THE ADDITIONAL YEARS OF NOTIONAL EMPLOYMENT FROM WHICH A WORKER MAY BENEFIT BY THE NUMBER OF YEARS IN RESPECT OF WHICH HE MAY CLAIM A PENSION IN ANOTHER MEMBER STATE .  MR ROMANO CONSIDERS THAT LEGISLATION OF THE KIND AT ISSUE IN THIS CASE CONTAINS A ' PROVISION FOR REDUCTION OF BENEFIT '  WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/WHICH MUST NOT BE APPLIED , BY VIRTUE OF ARTICLE ( ), WHEN THE AMOUNT OF A MIGRANT WORKER ' S PENSION IS CALCULATED UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THAT REGULATION . THE REDUCTION IS EFFECTED BY DEDUCTING THE PERIODS OF INSURANCE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF ANOTHER MEMBER STATE FROM THOSE NORMALLY TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION FOR THE CALCULATION OF THE PENSION . BUT THAT FACT IS IMMATERIAL SINCE THE RULE IS MERELY A TECHNICAL METHOD OF PREVENTING THE OVERLAPPING OF BENEFITS . MR ROMANO ALSO REFERS TO PARAGRAPH ( C ) OF THE OPERATIVE PART OF THE COURT ' S JUDGMENT OF JULY IN THE ABOVE-MENTIONED CELESTRE CASE .  THE COMMISSION CONSIDERS THAT A NATIONAL PROVISION WHICH REDUCES THE ADDITIONAL YEARS OF NOTIONAL EMPLOYMENT FROM WHICH A WORKER MAY BENEFIT BY THE NUMBER OF YEARS IN RESPECT OF WHICH HE MAY CLAIM A PENSION IN ANOTHER MEMBER STATE CONSTITUTES A PROVISION FOR REDUCTION OF BENEFIT WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/AND THAT , WHEN THE BENEFIT IS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE ( ), THAT NATIONAL PROVISION IS NOT TO BE APPLIED , HAVING REGARD TO THE LAST SENTENCE OF ARTICLE ( ).  THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT INFERS FROM THE OPERATIVE PART OF THE COURT ' S JUDGMENT OF JULY IN THE CELESTRE CASE THAT ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/PRECLUDES THE APPLICATION OF A NATIONAL RULE TO THE CALCULATION OF A PENSION AWARDED UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THAT REGULATION WHICH REDUCES THE BENEFIT OF THE ADDITIONAL YEARS OF NOTIONAL EMPLOYMENT BY THE YEARS OF INSURANCE COMPLETED IN ANOTHER MEMBER STATE .  IT MUST BE POINTED OUT IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE PENSION AWARDED TO A WORKER WHO HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO THE LEGISLATION OF MORE THAN ONE MEMBER STATE MUST , IN THE MEMBER STATE IN WHICH ' THE CONDITIONS FOR ENTITLEMENT TO BENEFIT HAVE BEEN SATISFIED , WITHOUT APPLICATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE BEING NECESSARY ' , BE CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ( ).  IN ITS JUDGMENT OF JULY IN THE CELESTRE CASE THE COURT STATED THAT : ' IT IS CLEAR FROM THE LAST SENTENCE OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1408/THAT WHERE THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF THE REGULATION ARE APPLIED , NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS FOR REDUCTION , SUSPENSION OR WITHDRAWAL DO NOT APPLY . IT FOLLOWS THAT THE AMOUNT REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE ( ) IS THE AMOUNT TO WHICH THE WORKER WOULD BE ENTITLED UNDER NATIONAL LEGISLATION IF HE WERE NOT IN RECEIPT OF A PENSION BY VIRTUE OF THE LEGISLATION OF ANOTHER MEMBER STATE ' .  IT FOLLOWS FROM THE AFORESAID JUDGMENT THAT , PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) AND ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/, THE AMOUNT OF A MIGRANT WORKER ' S PENSION MUST BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT NATIONAL LEGISLATION , IRRESPECTIVE OF ANY ENTITLEMENT TO A PENSION WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF ANY OTHER MEMBER STATE .  THE FACT THAT THE REDUCTION OF THE ADDITIONAL YEARS OF NOTIONAL EMPLOYMENT FROM WHICH A WORKER MAY BENEFIT BY THE NUMBER OF YEARS IN RESPECT OF WHICH HE MAY CLAIM A PENSION IN ANOTHER MEMBER STATE IS NOW EFFECTED AT NATIONAL LEVEL ON THE BASIS OF A STATUTORY PROVISION , AND NO LONGER BY THE APPLICATION OF A MERE ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE , CANNOT ALTER THAT CONCLUSION .  FOR THOSE REASONS , THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION SUBMITTED BY THE NATIONAL COURT MUST BE THAT A NATIONAL PROVISION WHICH REDUCES THE ADDITIONAL YEARS OF NOTIONAL EMPLOYMENT FROM WHICH A WORKER MAY BENEFIT BY THE NUMBER OF YEARS IN RESPECT OF WHICH HE MAY CLAIM A PENSION IN ANOTHER MEMBER STATE CONSTITUTES A PROVISION FOR REDUCTION OF BENEFIT WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE APPLICATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEMES TO EMPLOYED PERSONS AND THEIR FAMILIES MOVING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY WHICH , BY VIRTUE OF THE LAST SENTENCE OF ARTICLE ( ), IS NOT TO BE APPLIED WHEN THE AMOUNT OF THE PENSION IS CALCULATED UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THAT REGULATION .
