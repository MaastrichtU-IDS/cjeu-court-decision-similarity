Summary
. ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY , WHICH IS LIMITED TO THE QUESTION OF PAY DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN WORKERS , CONSTITUTES A SPECIAL RULE , WHOSE APPLICATION IS LINKED TO PRECISE FACTORS . IT CANNOT BE INTERPRETED AS PRESCRIBING , IN ADDITION TO EQUAL PAY , EQUALITY IN RESPECT OF THE OTHER WORKING CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO MEN AND WOMEN .  THE FACT THAT THE FIXING OF CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT - SUCH AS A SPECIAL AGE-LIMIT - MAY HAVE PECUNIARY CONSEQUENCES IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO BRING SUCH CONDITIONS WITHIN THE FIELD OF APPLICATION OF ARTICLE , WHICH IS BASED ON THE CLOSE CONNEXION WHICH EXISTS BETWEEN THE NATURE OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED AND THE AMOUNT OF REMUNERATION .  . FUNDAMENTAL PERSONAL HUMAN RIGHTS FORM PART OF THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY LAW , THE OBSERVANCE OF WHICH THE COURT HAS A DUTY TO ENSURE . THE ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SEX FORMS PART OF THOSE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS . HOWEVER , IT IS NOT FOR THE COURT TO ENFORCE THE OBSERVANCE OF THAT RULE OF NON- DISCRIMINATION IN RESPECT OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE WHICH ARE A MATTER EXCLUSIVELY FOR NATIONAL LAW .

THE FIRST PART OF THE QUESTION - SCOPE OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY   12THE FIRST PART OF THE QUESTION RAISED BY THE COUR DE CASSATION SEEKS TO DISCOVER WHETHER THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL PAY LAID DOWN BY ARTICLE MAY BE INTERPRETED AS REQUIRING GENERAL EQUALITY OF WORKING CONDITIONS FOR MEN AND WOMEN , SO THAT THE INSERTION INTO THE CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT OF AN AIR HOSTESS OF A CLAUSE BRINGING THE CONTRACT TO AN END WHEN SHE REACHES THE AGE OF YEARS , IT BEING ESTABLISHED THAT NO SUCH LIMIT IS ATTACHED TO THE CONTRACT OF MALE CABIN ATTENDANTS WHO CARRY OUT THE SAME WORK , CONSTITUTES DISCRIMINATION PROHIBITED BY THE SAID PROVISION .   13ACCORDING TO THE APPELLANT IN THE MAIN ACTION ARTICLE MUST BE GIVEN A WIDE INTERPRETATION , INASMUCH AS IT IS ONLY A SPECIFIC STATEMENT OF A GENERAL PRINCIPLE AGAINST DISCRIMINATION WHICH HAS FOUND MANY EXPRESSIONS IN THE TREATY .   14IN PARTICULAR SHE CLAIMS THAT THE CONTESTED CLAUSE CONTAINED IN THE CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT OF AIR HOSTESSES , FIXING AN AGE-LIMIT OF , IS SUBJECT TO THE RULE AGAINST DISCRIMINATION CONTAINED IN ARTICLE BY REASON OF THE FACT THAT , FIRST , A WOMAN WORKER CAN RECEIVE PAY EQUAL TO THAT RECEIVED BY MEN ONLY IF THE REQUIREMENT REGARDING EQUAL CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT IS FIRST SATISFIED AND , SECONDLY , THAT THE AGE-LIMIT IMPOSED ON AIR HOSTESSES BY THE CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT HAS PECUNIARY CONSEQUENCES WHICH ARE PREJUDICIAL AS REGARDS THE ALLOWANCE ON TERMINATION OF SERVICE AND PENSION .   15THE FIELD OF APPLICATION OF ARTICLE MUST BE DETERMINED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE SYSTEM OF THE SOCIAL PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY , WHICH ARE SET OUT IN THE CHAPTER FORMED BY ARTICLE ET SEQ .   16THE GENERAL FEATURES OF THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT AND WORKING CONDITIONS ARE CONSIDERED IN ARTICLES AND FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE HARMONIZATION OF THE SOCIAL SYSTEMS OF THE MEMBER STATES AND OF THE APPROXIMATION OF THEIR LAWS IN THAT FIELD .   17THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION BASED ON THE SEX OF WORKERS FORMS PART OF THE PROGRAMME FOR SOCIAL AND LEGISLATIVE POLICY WHICH WAS CLARIFIED IN CERTAIN RESPECTS BY THE COUNCIL RESOLUTION OF JANUARY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL C , P . ).   18THE SAME THOUGHT ALSO UNDERLIES COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 76/207/EEC OF FEBRUARY ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL TREATMENT FOR MEN AND WOMEN AS REGARDS ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT , VOCATIONAL TRAINING AND PROMOTION AND WORKING CONDITIONS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ).   19IN CONTRAST TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES AND , WHICH ARE ESSENTIALLY IN THE NATURE OF A PROGRAMME , ARTICLE , WHICH IS LIMITED TO THE QUESTION OF PAY DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN WORKERS , CONSTITUTES A SPECIAL RULE , WHOSE APPLICATION IS LINKED TO PRECISE FACTORS .   20IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXTEND THE SCOPE OF THAT ARTICLE TO ELEMENTS OF THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP OTHER THAN THOSE EXPRESSLY REFERRED TO .   21IN PARTICULAR , THE FACT THAT THE FIXING OF CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT - SUCH AS A SPECIAL AGE-LIMIT - MAY HAVE PECUNIARY CONSEQUENCES IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO BRING SUCH CONDITIONS WITHIN THE FIELD OF APPLICATION OF ARTICLE , WHICH IS BASED ON THE CLOSE CONNEXION WHICH EXISTS BETWEEN THE NATURE OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED AND THE AMOUNT OF REMUNERATION .   22THAT IS A FORTIORI TRUE SINCE THE TOUCHSTONE WHICH FORMS THE BASIS OF ARTICLE - THAT IS , THE COMPARABLE NATURE OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY WORKERS OF EITHER SEX - IS A FACTOR AS REGARDS WHICH ALL WORKERS ARE EX HYPOTHESI ON AN EQUAL FOOTING , WHEREAS IN MANY RESPECTS AN ASSESSMENT OF THE OTHER CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT AND WORKING CONDITIONS INVOLVES FACTORS CONNECTED WITH THE SEX OF THE WORKERS , TAKING INTO ACCOUNT CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING THE SPECIAL POSITION OF WOMEN IN THE WORK PROCESS .   23IT IS , THEREFORE , IMPOSSIBLE TO WIDEN THE TERMS OF ARTICLE TO THE POINT , FIRST , OF JEOPARDIZING THE DIRECT APPLICABILITY WHICH THAT PROVISION MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED TO HAVE IN ITS OWN SPHERE AND , SECONDLY , OF INTERVENING IN AN AREA RESERVED BY ARTICLES AND TO THE DISCRETION OF THE AUTHORITIES REFERRED TO THEREIN .   24THE REPLY TO THE FIRST PART OF THE QUESTION MUST THEREFORE BE THAT ARTICLE OF THE TREATY CANNOT BE INTERPRETED AS PRESCRIBING , IN ADDITION TO EQUAL PAY , EQUALITY IN RESPECT OF THE OTHER WORKING CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO MEN AND WOMEN .  THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION - THE EXISTENCE OF A GENERAL PRINCIPLE PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SEX IN CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT AND WORKING CONDITIONS   25THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION ASKS WHETHER , APART FROM THE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE , COMMUNITY LAW CONTAINS ANY GENERAL PRINCIPLE PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SEX AS REGARDS THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT AND WORKING CONDITIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN .   26THE COURT HAS REPEATEDLY STATED THAT RESPECT FOR FUNDAMENTAL PERSONAL HUMAN RIGHTS IS ONE OF THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY LAW , THE OBSERVANCE OF WHICH IT HAS A DUTY TO ENSURE .   27THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SEX FORMS PART OF THOSE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS .   28MOREOVER , THE SAME CONCEPTS ARE RECOGNIZED BY THE EUROPEAN SOCIAL CHARTER OF NOVEMBER AND BY CONVENTION NO OF THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATION OF JUNE CONCERNING DISCRIMINATION IN RESPECT OF EMPLOYMENT AND OCCUPATION .   29ATTENTION MUST BE DRAWN IN THIS REGARD TO THE FACT THAT IN ITS JUDGMENTS OF JUNE IN CASE 20/SABBATINI ( NEE BERTONI ) V EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT (( ) ECR ) AND FEBRUARY IN CASE 21/AIROLA V COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES (( ) ECR ), THE COURT RECOGNIZED THE NEED TO ENSURE EQUALITY IN THE MATTER OF WORKING CONDITIONS FOR MEN AND WOMEN EMPLOYED BY THE COMMUNITY ITSELF , WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS .   30ON THE OTHER HAND , AS REGARDS THE RELATIONSHIPS OF EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO NATIONAL LAW , THE COMMUNITY HAD NOT , AT THE TIME OF THE EVENTS NOW BEFORE THE BELGIAN COURTS , ASSUMED ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUPERVISING AND GUARANTEEING THE OBSERVANCE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN IN WORKING CONDITIONS OTHER THAN REMUNERATION .   31AS HAS BEEN STATED ABOVE , AT THE PERIOD UNDER CONSIDERATION COMMUNITY LAW CONTAINED ONLY THE PROVISIONS IN THE NATURE OF A PROGRAMME LAID DOWN BY ARTICLES AND OF THE TREATY , WHICH RELATE TO THE GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL WELFARE , IN PARTICULAR AS REGARDS CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT AND WORKING CONDITIONS .   32IT FOLLOWS THAT THE SITUATION BEFORE THE BELGIAN COURTS IS GOVERNED BY THE PROVISIONS AND PRINCIPLES OF INTERNAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW IN FORCE IN BELGIUM .   33THE REPLY TO THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION MUST THEREFORE BE THAT AT THE TIME OF THE EVENTS WHICH FORM THE BASIS OF THE MAIN ACTION THERE WAS , AS REGARDS THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE UNDER NATIONAL LAW , NO RULE OF COMMUNITY LAW PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN IN THE MATTER OF WORKING CONDITIONS OTHER THAN THE REQUIREMENTS AS TO PAY REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .
