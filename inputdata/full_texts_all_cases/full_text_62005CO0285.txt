Operative part
1.
Having regard to Article 6(3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3577/of December applying the principle of freedom
                     to provide services to maritime transport within Member States (maritime cabotage), the latter must be interpreted as not
                     conferring rights on individuals, before January 2004, in the area of cabotage with the Greek islands for regular passenger
                     and cargo services and services provided by vessels of less than gross tonnes.
                  
2.
Articles 5(2) and 6(3)(a) to (c), (f) and (g) of Council Directive 98/18/EC of March on safety rules and standards
                     for passenger ships must be interpreted as precluding a national rule, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which
                     prohibits absolutely ships having reached a specified age from carrying out domestic voyages, when the Member State in question
                     has not taken measures to improve safety requirements in accordance with the procedure laid down by Article 7(4) of that directive.
