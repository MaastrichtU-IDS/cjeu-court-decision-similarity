Grounds
ALTHOUGH CERTAIN OF THE GROUNDS ON WHICH THE SUBSTANTIVE APPLICATION IS MADE APPEAR, ON FIRST EXAMINATION, NOT TO BE MANIFESTLY WITHOUT FOUNDATION AND THUS MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DISMISS THE PRESENT APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES, NEVERTHELESS IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE MEASURES APPLIED FOR SHOULD APPEAR TO BE URGENTLY REQUIRED .  IN THIS REGARD, THE APPLICATION FOR THE SUSPENSION OF OPERATION OF THE DECISION IN QUESTION IS INTENDED TO AVOID IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE TO JFB IN THE EVENT OF THAT DECISION BEING DECLARED VOID BY THE COURT .  TO GRANT THE APPLICATION WOULD RESULT IN MAKING THE CREDITORS OF JSL, WHO ARE ENTITLED TO A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF SHARES IN JFB, SUFFER DAMAGE AT LEAST AS SERIOUS AND AS IRREPARABLE AS THAT WHICH THE LATTER FOUNDS UPON .  THOSE CREDITORS MAY INDEED HAVE THE GREATEST INTEREST IN SELLING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE SHARES WHICH CONSTITUTE THEIR SECURITY AND THIS THEY WOULD BE PREVENTED FROM DOING IF THE OPERATION OF THE COMMISSION'S DECISION, WHICH IS, AFTER ALL, PROVISIONALLY ENFORCEABLE HAVING REGARD TO ARTICLE OF THE ESCS TREATY, WERE TO BE SUSPENDED .  THE APPLICATION FOR SUSPENSION OF OPERATION OF THAT DECISION SHOULD ACCORDINGLY BE REFUSED .  IT REMAINS NONE THE LESS NECESSARY TO LIMIT THE DAMAGE WHICH JFB MIGHT SUFFER FROM THE PROVISIONAL OPERATION OF THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION IF, BY REASON OF THE ASSUMPTION OF CONTROL BY BSC, THE SUBSTANTIVE APPLICATION WERE TO ESCAPE CONSIDERATION BY THE COURT OR IF IMPORTANT DECISIONS AS TO THE FUTURE OF THE UNDERTAKING WERE TO RESULT FROM THAT ASSUMPTION OF CONTROL .  IT IS THEREFORE APPROPRIATE TO MAKE THE OPERATION OF THE COMMISSION'S DECISION SUBJECT TO TWO CONDITIONS DESIGNED TO KEEP THE POSITION AS STABLE AS POSSIBLE IN THE INTERESTS OF ALL PARTIES UNTIL JUDGMENT ON THE SUBSTANTIVE APPLICATION - THAT IS TO SAY FIRST THE NON-EXERCISE BY BSC OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ATTACHED TO ANY SHARES THAT IT MAY ACQUIRE IN JFB AND ON OTHER HAND THE SUSPENSION OF OPERATION OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE DECISION UNTIL THAT JUDGMENT IS DELIVERED .  
Decision on costs
IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS APPROPRIATE TO RESERVE COSTS .
