Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY BY NOT IMPLEMENTING IN GOOD TIME COMMISSION DIRECTIVE NO 76/696/EEC OF JULY ADAPTING TO TECHNICAL PROGRESS COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 73/360/EEC OF NOVEMBER ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO NON-AUTOMATIC WEIGHING MACHINES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON FEBRUARY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH COMMISSION DIRECTIVE NO 76/OF JULY ADAPTING TO TECHNICAL PROGRESS THE COUNCIL DIRECTIVE OF NOVEMBER ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO NON-AUTOMATIC WEIGHING MACHINES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ), THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ONE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE THIRD PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY .   BY ARTICLE OF THAT DIRECTIVE MEMBER STATES WERE REQUIRED TO PUT INTO EFFECT THE MEASURES NEEDED TO COMPLY THEREWITH WITHIN A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF NOTIFICATION THEREOF ; THAT PERIOD EXPIRED ON JULY .    THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC DOES NOT DENY THAT IT HAS NOT MET THAT OBLIGATION . IT STATES THAT THE DELAY IN IMPLEMENTING THE DIRECTIVE WAS AT FIRST DUE TO THE FACT THAT A DRAFT LAW SUBMITTED FOR THAT PURPOSE HAD LAPSED OWING TO THE DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT AND THAT IT WAS LATER DUE TO THE FACT THAT A DRAFT LAW REQUESTING STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION FOR THE ADOPTION INTO THE ITALIAN LEGAL SYSTEM OF A NUMBER OF DIRECTIVES , THOUGH APPROVED BY THE SENATE ON JULY , WAS STILL UNDER SCRUTINY BY THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES .       THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES DO NOT EXPUNGE THE FAILURE TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS WITH WHICH THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC IS CHARGED . ACCORDING TO WELL-ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW , A MEMBER STATE MAY NOT PLEAD PROVISIONS , PRACTICES OR CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING IN ITS INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OBLIGATIONS AND TIME-LIMITS RESULTING FROM COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES .   IT MUST THEREFORE BE DECLARED THAT BY FAILING TO ADOPT , WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD , THE PROVISIONS NEEDED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH COMMISSION DIRECTIVE NO 76/OF JULY THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ONE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY .
