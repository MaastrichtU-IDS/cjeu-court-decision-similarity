Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Arbeidshof te Antwerpen (Afdeling Hasselt) – Interpretation of Council Directive 97/81/EC
                  of December concerning the Framework agreement on part-time work concluded by UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC (OJ L
                  14, p. 9) – National legislation providing for a system for the publication and monitoring of work schedules of part-time
                  workers, consisting of the mandatory compilation and retention, subject to criminal or administrative penalties, of documents
                  recording the exact duration of work performed by each worker.
               
Operative part 
Clause of the Framework agreement annexed to Council Directive 97/81/EC of December concerning the Framework agreement
         on part-time work concluded by UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which makes
         employers responsible for the obligations of retention and publication of the contracts and work-schedules of part-time workers,
         if it is established that such legislation does not lead to their being treated less favourably than full-time workers in
         a similar situation or, if there is such a difference in treatment, it is established that it is justified on objective grounds
         and does not go beyond what is necessary to attain the objectives thus pursued.
      
It is for the referring court to perform the necessary factual and legal investigation, particularly with regard to the applicable
         national law, in order to determine whether that is so in the case before it.
      
If the referring court were to conclude that the national legislation at issue is incompatible with Clause of the Framework
         Agreement on part-time work annexed to Directive 97/81, Clause 5(1) thereof would have to be interpreted as precluding such
         legislation.
