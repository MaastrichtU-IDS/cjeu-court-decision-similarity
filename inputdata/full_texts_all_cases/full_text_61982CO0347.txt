AS FAR AS THE URGENCY IS CONCERNED , IT IS SUFFICIENT TO REFER TO THE GROUNDS OF THE ORDER GIVEN BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE THIRD CHAMBER ON JULY . AS THE PARLIAMENT HAS FULFILLED OR OFFERED TO FULFIL ALL THE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS WHICH RESULTED FROM THE ANNULMENT OF THE FIRST DISMISSAL , THE APPLICANT ' S POSITION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS IT WAS AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES .   AS REGARDS THE GROUNDS FOR THE APPLICATION TO SUSPEND THE OPERATION OF THE DECISION , IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT BY ITS JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER , THE COURT ANNULLED THE FIRST DISMISSAL ON THE BASIS OF THE FAILURE TO RESPECT THE ADVERSARY PROCEDURE PROVIDED FOR UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS . IT REJECTED , HOWEVER , THE CLAIM FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE PROBATION REPORT . BY COMMUNICATING TO THE APPLICANT ALL THE PAPERS ON WHICH HIS DISMISSAL IS BASED , INCLUDING THE DOCUMENTS NOT PREVIOUSLY COMMUNICATED TO HIM , THE PARLIAMENT HAS COMPLIED IN THAT REGARD WITH THE JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER .    BY REFUSING , FOR HIS PART , TO SUBMIT COMMENTS ON THE DOCUMENTS COMMUNICATED TO HIM , THE APPLICANT HAS ATTEMPTED TO THWART THE ADVERSARY NATURE OF THE PROCEDURE , THE IMPORTANCE OF WHICH WAS EMPHASIZED IN THE JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER . ON THE FACE OF IT , THEREFORE , HE HAS ADMITTED THAT HE IS UNABLE TO REPLY SATISFACTORILY TO THE CIRTICISMS OF HIS CONDUCT DURING HIS PERIOD OF PROBATION .   IT MUST THEREFORE BE DECLARED THAT THE APPLICANT HAS , BY HIS OWN CONDUCT , PLACED HIMSELF OUTSIDE THE CONDITIONS WHICH , WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE , MIGHT HAVE JUSTIFIED THE ADOPTION OF AN INTERIM MEASURE FOR HIS BENEFIT .
