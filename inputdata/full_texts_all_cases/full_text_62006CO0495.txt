(Appeals – Promotion – promotion procedure – Staff report – Decision establishing the definitive version of the report – Decision to promote another official to the grade of Translator-reviser – Claim for compensation for damage – Appeal in part manifestly inadmissible and in part manifestly unfounded)
Appeal: brought against the judgment of the Court of First Instance (Second Chamber) of October in Case T-171/Nijs v Court of Auditors ECR-SC I-A-2-and II-A-2-in which the Court of First Instance dismissed – in so far as it relied on grounds other
         than a failure to give reasons – the action seeking, first, annulment of the decision establishing the definitive version
         of the appellant’s staff report for the reporting period, the decision allocating the appellant merit points for the
         reporting period and the decision not to promote him in 2004, and of the decision rejecting the complaint brought against
         those decisions and, secondly, an application for compensation in respect of the harm suffered.
      
Held: The appeal is dismissed. Mr Nijs is ordered to pay the costs.
