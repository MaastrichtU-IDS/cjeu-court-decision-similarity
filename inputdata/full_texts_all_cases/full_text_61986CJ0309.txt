Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON DECEMBER THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED THE PROVISIONS NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH :  COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 82/242/EEC OF MARCH ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO METHODS OF TESTING THE BIODEGRADABILITY OF NON-IONIC SURFACTANTS AND AMENDING DIRECTIVE 73/404/EEC, AND  COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 82/243/EEC OF MARCH AMENDING DIRECTIVE 73/405/EEC ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO METHODS OF TESTING THE BIODEGRADABILITY OF ANIONIC SURFACTANTS ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS "THE DIRECTIVES ").  THE DIRECTIVES PROVIDE THAT THE MEMBER STATES ARE TO BRING INTO FORCE THE PROVISIONS NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THEM WITHIN A PERIOD OF MONTHS OF THEIR NOTIFICATION AND TO INFORM THE COMMISSION THEREOF FORTHWITH . THE DIRECTIVES WERE NOTIFIED TO THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC ON APRIL .  AS THE COMMISSION HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY COMMUNICATION FROM THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT CONCERNING THE MEASURES TRANSPOSING THE DIRECTIVES IN QUESTION INTO NATIONAL LAW, IT SENT A LETTER OF FORMAL NOTICE TO THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT ON NOVEMBER REQUESTING IT TO SUBMIT ITS OBSERVATIONS . BY A TELEX MESSAGE OF MARCH THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATION OF ITALY AT THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES REPLIED THAT THE ITALIAN MINISTER FOR HEALTH WAS CONSIDERING A SUITABLE METHOD OF ANALYSING DETERGENTS WHICH WOULD MAKE EARLY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMMUNITY RULES POSSIBLE . AFTER DELIVERING A REASONED OPINION ON MAY TO WHICH THERE WAS NO RESPONSE THE COMMISSION BROUGHT THIS ACTION .  REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING FOR THE BACKGROUND TO THE DISPUTE AND THE SUBMISSIONS AND ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES, WHICH ARE MENTIONED OR DISCUSSED HEREINAFTER ONLY IN SO FAR AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE REASONING OF THE COURT .  THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT ACCEPTS THAT IT HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS BUT OBSERVES THAT ITS DOMESTIC LEGISLATION, IN PARTICULAR LAW NO OF APRIL 1983, ON THE METHOD OF DETERMINING THE PERCENTAGE LEVEL OF BIODEGRADABILITY OF ANIONIC SYNTHETIC DETERGENTS, CONTAINS PROVISIONS ENABLING SOME OF THE OBJECTIVES OF THE DIRECTIVES TO BE ATTAINED . CONSEQUENTLY, IN ITS VIEW ITS FAILURE CONSISTS IN THE FACT THAT IT HAS GIVEN ONLY PARTIAL EFFECT TO THOSE DIRECTIVES .  IT MUST BE POINTED OUT THAT, AS THE COURT HAS REAFFIRMED IN PARTICULAR IN ITS JUDGMENT OF APRIL IN CASE 363/( COMMISSION V ITALIAN REPUBLIC (( )) ECR ) THE TRANSPOSITION OF COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES INTO DOMESTIC LAW MUST EFFECTIVELY GUARANTEE THEIR FULL APPLICATION . THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS ADMITTED THAT ITS DOMESTIC LEGISLATION DOES NOT REPRESENT A COMPLETE TRANSPOSITION OF THE DIRECTIVES IN QUESTION .  IT FOLLOWS THAT IT MUST BE DECLARED THAT, BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVES 82/AND 82/OF MARCH 1982, THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY .
