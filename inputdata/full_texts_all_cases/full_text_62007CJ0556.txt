Operative part
The Court:
1.
	Declares that, by failing sufficiently to monitor, inspect and supervise fishing activities in the light of the prohibition
                     on drift nets for the capture of certain species, and by not ensuring that appropriate measures against those responsible
                     for infringements of the Community legislation on the use of drift nets were taken, the French Republic has failed to fulfil
                     its obligations under Articles and 31(1) and (2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/of October establishing
                     a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 2846/of December
                     and Articles 23(1) and (2), and 25(1) and (2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/of December on the conservation
                     and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy;
                  
2.
	Orders the French Republic to pay the costs.
