Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION OF THE COURT OF AUDITORS OF NOVEMBER IMPLEMENTING THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF OCTOBER ( CASE 9/, ( ) ECR ) AND RECLASSIFYING THE APPLICANT IN A STEP WHICH HE DOES NOT CONSIDER HIGH ENOUGH , 
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON MAY , CALVIN WILLIAMS , AN OFFICIAL OF THE COURT OF AUDITORS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION OF THE COURT OF AUDITORS OF NOVEMBER IMPLEMENTING THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF OCTOBER ( CASE 9/WILLIAMS V COURT OF AUDITORS ( ) ECR ) AND RECLASSIFYING HIM IN A STEP WHICH HE DOES NOT CONSIDER HIGH ENOUGH .  THE JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER CONCERNED A DISPUTE WHICH HAD ITS ORIGIN IN THE PUBLICATION BY THE COURT OF AUDITORS OF A ' GENERAL DECISION '  FEBRUARY RELATING TO THE CRITERIA FOR THE APPOINTMENT AND CLASSIFICATION OF STAFF . IN THE COURSE OF , THE COURT OF AUDITORS RECRUITED OFFICIALS AND OTHER STAFF WHO WERE NOT ALREADY IN THE SERVICE OF THE COMMUNITIES . THOSE PERSONS WERE CLASSIFIED , WITH EFFECT FROM FEBRUARY , IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NEW CRITERIA LAID DOWN BY THE AFORESAID DECISION , WHICH IS IN THE NATURE OF AN INTERNAL DIRECTIVE .  ARTICLE OF THAT DECISION IS ENTITLED ' ADDITIONAL SENIORITY ALLOWANCE '  AND READS AS FOLLOWS : ' IN CONSIDERATION OF A CANDIDATE ' S PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE WHICH EXCEEDS THE LENGTH OF THAT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FOR DETERMINING HIS GRADE OF APPOINTMENT , THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY SHALL ALLOW ADDITIONAL SENIORITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ANNEXED TABLE '  FOR GRADES A TO A , A MAXIMUM OF MONTHS ). ARTICLE , ENTITLED ' TEMPORARY STAFF APPOINTED AS OFFICIALS ' , PROVIDES THAT : ' A MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF APPOINTED AS A PROBATIONER TO A POST IN THE SAME CAREER BRACKET AND PLACED IN THE SAME GRADE SHALL , ON THE DATE OF HIS APPOINTMENT AS A PROBATIONER , BE ENTITLED TO THE SENIORITY ACQUIRED SINCE HIS APPOINTMENT AS A MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF . '  THE APPLICANT WAS RECRUITED AS A TEMPORARY SERVANT ON OCTOBER BY THE AUDIT BOARD , WHICH WAS THEN PART OF THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES . HE WAS CLASSIFIED IN GRADE A , STEP . ON OCTOBER , FOLLOWING HIS SUCCESSFUL PARTICIPATION IN A COMPETITION , THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY OF THE COUNCIL APPOINTED HIM A PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL IN GRADE A , STEP . ON JUNE HE WAS ESTABLISHED IN THAT GRADE . ON MAY HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE COURT OF AUDITORS AT HIS OWN REQUEST , WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN HIS GRADE AND STEP . LIKE ALL THE OTHER OFFICIALS TRANSFERRED TO THE COURT OF AUDITORS , THE APPLICANT WAS PROMOTED , IN HIS CASE WITH EFFECT FROM MAY TO GRADE A 6,STEP , HIS SENIORITY IN THAT STEP BEING ANTEDATED TO JULY . HE THUS REACHED STEP OF GRADE A ON JULY .   ACCORDING TO MR WILLIAMS , HOWEVER , THE APPLICATION OF THE CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA LAID DOWN BY THE GENERAL DECISION OF FEBRUARY RESULTED IN DISCRIMINATION AGAINST EXISTING OFFICIALS TRANSFERRED , LIKE HIM , FROM THE AUDIT BOARD , AS COMPARED WITH NEWLY RECRUITED OFFICIALS AND OTHER SERVANTS .  IN AN ACTION BROUGHT BY MR WILLIAMS REQUESTING THE COURT TO TERMINATE THAT INEQUALITY , THE COURT HELD IN THE AFORESAID JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER THAT ON THE BASIS OF THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY OF TREATMENT AS BETWEEN OFFICIALS OF THE SAME CATEGORY , EXPRESSED IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS , ' THE DEFENDANT ' S DECISION REFUSING TO REVIEW THE APPLICANT ' S CLASSIFICATION SHOULD BE ANNULLED AND THE DEFENDANT SHOULD BE ORDERED TO CLASSIFY THE APPLICANT IN THE APPROPRIATE STEP , TAKING ACCOUNT OF HIS EXPERIENCE AND POSSIBLY OF HIS QUALIFICATIONS IN CONFORMITY WITH THE DECISION OF FEBRUARY , IN ORDER TO REMOVE THE DIFFERENCE IN CLASSIFICATION BETWEEN HIM AND OFFICIALS FROM OUTSIDE THE COMMUNITY TO WHOM THE CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED DECISION HAVE BEEN APPLIED ' .  IN PARAGRAPH OF THE OPERATIVE PART OF THE JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER , THE COURT ORDERED THE COURT OF AUDITORS TO CORRECT THE STEP ASSIGNED TO THE APPLICANT WITH EFFECT FROM MAY ( THE DATE OF HIS COMPLAINT ) AND TO OBSERVE THE CRITERIA LAID DOWN IN ITS DECISION OF FEBRUARY .   IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THAT JUDGMENT THE COURT OF AUDITORS ADOPTED A DECISION DATED NOVEMBER IN WHICH THE DETAILED STATEMENT OF REASONS LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , THE RECLASSIFICATION WHICH MUST BE CARRIED OUT SINCE IT WAS A CASE OF ' DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN A TRANSFERRED OFFICIAL AND A NEWLY RECRUITED OFFICIAL MUST RESULT IN THE GRANTING OF ADDITIONAL SENIORITY NOT EXCEEDING MONTHS ' . ON THAT BASIS , SINCE ON MAY THE APPLICANT WAS IN GRADE A , STEP , WITH SENIORITY IN STEP FROM JULY , THE COURT OF AUDITORS CORRECTED HIS CLASSIFICATION WITH EFFECT FROM MAY IN THE FOLLOWING WAY : HE WAS PLACED IN GRADE A , STEP , WITH EFFECT FROM MAY ; AND IN GRADE A , STEP , WITH EFFECT FROM MAY .   BY A COMPLAINT DATED DECEMBER , THE APPLICANT CHALLENGED THE MANNER IN WHICH THE COURT OF AUDITORS HAD APPLIED THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF OCTOBER . HE STATED THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED WITH EFFECT FROM OCTOBER , THE DATE OF HIS RECRUITMENT AS A MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF , WITH THE RESULT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN APPOINTED ON MAY TO GRADE A , STEP , WITH SENIORITY IN STEP FROM DECEMBER .   MR WILLIAMS '  COMPLAINT WAS REJECTED BY A DECISION DATED MARCH AND HE THEN BROUGHT THE PRESENT ACTION , CLAIMING THAT THE COURT SHOULD ANNUL THE DECISION OF NOVEMBER RECLASSIFYING HIM AND THE DECISION OF MARCH REJECTING HIS COMPLAINT .  INITIALLY , BOTH DURING THE ADMINISTRATIVE STAGE AND DURING THE WRITTEN PROCEDURE BEFORE THE COURT , THE APPLICANT SOUGHT ADDITIONAL SENIORITY BY VIRTUE OF BOTH ARTICLE AND ARTICLE OF THE GENERAL DECISION OF FEBRUARY .   HOWEVER , IN HIS MOST RECENT CONCLUSIONS , FORMULATED AT THE HEARING , THE APPLICANT STATED THAT HE WAS ABANDONING ANY CLAIM BASED ON ARTICLE OF THE GENERAL DECISION AND WAS MERELY ASKING FOR AN ADDITIONAL STEP IN RESPECT OF THE PERIOD BETWEEN AND , WHEN HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF , PURSUANT SOLELY TO ARTICLE OF THE GENERAL DECISION .  THE APPLICANT DOES NOT DENY THAT HE HAS BEEN GRANTED BY THE COURT OF AUDITORS A TOTAL OF MONTHS '  ADDITIONAL SENIORITY BOTH WHEN HE WAS PLACED IN GRADE A AND IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER . HE DEMANDS , HOWEVER , THAT ARTICLE OF THE INTERNAL DIRECTIVE OF FEBRUARY SHOULD BE APPLIED AND SUBMITS THAT HE IS ENTITLED TO ADDITIONAL SENIORITY OF ONE STEP IN RESPECT OF THE PERIOD WHICH HE SPENT AS A MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF . HE CLAIMS , FIRST , THAT THE COURT OF AUDITORS CANNOT DEPART FROM ITS OWN INTERNAL DIRECTIVE AND , SECONDLY , THAT BY VIRTUE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY THE SENIORITY IN STEP TO WHICH HE IS ENTITLED CANNOT BE LIMITED TO MONTHS , SINCE THE COURT OF AUDITORS HAS IN THE PAST ALLOWED MUCH GREATER SENIORITY TO STAFF RECRUITED FROM OUTSIDE . THE REFUSAL TO ALLOW HIM THE SENIORITY CLAIMED THEREFORE PERPETUATES DISCRIMINATION WHICH WAS CONDEMNED BY THE COURT IN ITS JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER .   IT MUST BE POINTED OUT THAT , ALTHOUGH THE COURT IN ITS JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER ORDERED THE COURT OF AUDITORS TO ' REMOVE THE DIFFERENCE IN CLASSIFICATION BETWEEN HIM AND OFFICIALS FROM OUTSIDE THE COMMUNITY ' , IT COULD NOT HAVE INTENDED TO AUTHORIZE THE COURT OF AUDITORS TO BREACH THE PROVISIONS OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , AND IN PARTICULAR ARTICLE . THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY OF TREATMENT , TO WHICH THAT JUDGMENT REFERS , MUST BE RECONCILED WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY , ACCORDING TO WHICH NO PERSON MAY RELY , IN SUPPORT OF HIS CLAIM , ON AN UNLAWFUL ACT COMMITTED IN FAVOUR OF ANOTHER ( JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER IN CASE 188/WITTE V EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ( ) ECR ).  THUS THE SOLE EFFECT OF THE JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER WAS TO REQUIRE THE COURT OF AUDITORS TO RESTORE EQUALITY OF TREATMENT BETWEEN OFFICIALS , SUBJECT TO THE LIMITS ON THE ADDITIONAL SENIORITY WHICH MAY BE GRANTED UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  AS THE COURT HELD IN ITS JUDGMENTS OF JULY ( CASE 17/ANGELIDIS V COMMISSION ( ) ECR ) AND OF JUNE ( CASE 146/DE SANTIS V COURT OF AUDITORS ( ) ECR ), PERIODS OF SERVICE AS A MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF OF AN INSTITUTION , TOGETHER WITH QUALIFICATIONS AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE , ARE TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT ON THE BASIS OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS . THEY ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO THE SAME RESTRICTIONS ON THE MAXIMUM ADDITIONAL SENIORITY THAT MAY BE GRANTED , THAT IS TO SAY - FOR THE GRADE IN QUESTION - MONTHS .  SINCE THE APPLICANT DOES NOT DISPUTE THAT THE COURT OF AUDITORS HAS ALLOWED HIM SENIORITY AT THE MAXIMUM AUTHORIZED RATE , HE IS NOT ENTITLED TO RELY UPON THE JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER IN ORDER TO CLAIM ADDITIONAL SENIORITY .  IT FOLLOWS FROM THE FOREGOING THAT THE APPLICATION MUST BE DISMISSED .  
Decision on costs
COSTS UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE , THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS . HOWEVER , ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE PROVIDES THAT INSTITUTIONS SHALL BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS IN PROCEEDINGS COMMENCED BY EMPLOYEES OF THE COMMUNITIES , WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ), WHICH AUTHORIZES THE COURT TO ORDER A PARTY TO PAY COSTS WHICH THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT PARTY TO HAVE UNREASONABLY OR VEXATIOUSLY CAUSED THE OPPOSITE PARTY TO INCUR .  THE COURT OF AUDITORS CONTENDS THAT THE PROCEEDINGS COMMENCED BY THE APPLICANT MUST BE REGARDED AS ABUSIVE AND VEXATIOUS AND THEREFORE ASKS THE COURT TO ORDER THE APPLICANT TO PAY THE WHOLE OF THE COSTS .  IT MUST BE NOTED THAT THE COURT OF AUDITORS ITSELF EXPERIENCED SOME DIFFICULTIES IN IMPLEMENTING THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF OCTOBER , SINCE ON NOVEMBER IT LODGED AN APPLICATION FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF THAT JUDGMENT IN WHICH IT ASKED WHETHER OR NOT ARTICLE OF THE DECISION OF FEBRUARY APPLIED TO MR WILLIAMS . UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THE PROCEEDINGS COMMENCED BY THE APPLICANT CANNOT BE REGARDED AS ABUSIVE OR VEXATIOUS AND THE PARTIES SHOULD BE ORDERED TO BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS THE COURT ( THIRD CHAMBER )   HEREBY :    ( ) DISMISSES THE APPLICATION ;   ( ) ORDERS THE PARTIES TO BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .
