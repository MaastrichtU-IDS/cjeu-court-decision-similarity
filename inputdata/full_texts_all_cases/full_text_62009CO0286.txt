Reference for a preliminary ruling – Corte d’appello di Roma – Interpretation of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/of the Council
                  of June on the application of social security schemes to employed persons and their families moving within the Community
                  – Interpretation of Articles 17, and EC – Old-age pension – Aggregation of insurance periods – Failure to take into
                  account the period of affiliation to the Joint Sickness Insurance Scheme of the European Communities.
               
Operative part: 
Article EC, together with the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities, must be interpreted as precluding
         national legislation that does not permit account to be taken of years worked by a European Union citizen in a European Union
         institution, such as the Commission of the European Communities, or in a European Union body, such as the Economic and Social
         Committee, for the purpose of establishing a right to a retirement pension under the national scheme, regardless of whether
         the person involved takes early retirement or retires at the usual age.
