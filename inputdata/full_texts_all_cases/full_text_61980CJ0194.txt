Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON SEPTEMBER , P . BENASSI , AN OFFICIAL OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR ANNULMENT OF THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION OF SEPTEMBER REJECTING HIS COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS IN WHICH HE REQUESTED THAT THE NUMBER OF YEARS OF PENSIONABLE SERVICE WITH WHICH HE WAS TO BE CREDITED ON THE BASIS OF THE AMOUNT OF THE ACTUARIAL EQUIVALENT OR THE SUMS REPAID REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE ( ) OF ANNEX VIII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS SHOULD , PURSUANT TO THE GENERAL PROVISIONS GIVING EFFECT TO THE SAID ARTICLE ( ) AND IN PARTICULAR PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THOSE GENERAL PROVISIONS , BE CALCULATED WITH REFERENCE TO HIS BASIC ANNUAL SALARY , WITHOUT THE APPLICATION OF THE WEIGHTING - 148.IN THIS CASE - FIXED BY REGULATION NO 2998/OF THE COUNCIL OF NOVEMBER .  THE APPLICANT MAINTAINS , IN THAT REGARD , THAT THE BASIC ANNUAL SALARY IS DETERMINED BY ADDING TOGETHER THE TWELVE MONTHLY BASIC SALARY PAYMENTS DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , WHICH DEFINES     THE BASIC SALARIES FOR EACH GRADE AND STEP , WITHOUT APPLYING ANY WEIGHTING . HE CONSIDERS THAT THE APPLICATION OF A WEIGHTING TO THAT AMOUNT IS DUE TO A CONFUSION BETWEEN REMUNERATION IN THE STRICT SENSE AND BASIC SALARY .   THE APPLICANT FURTHER STATES THAT REFERENCE TO THE BASIC ANNUAL SALARY ADJUSTED BY A WEIGHTING WOULD HAVE UNACCEPTABLE CONSEQUENCES IN THE FORM OF ABSURD AND DISCRIMINATORY DISPARITIES AFFECTING THE PERSONS CONCERNED ACCORDING TO THEIR PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT .   THE COMMISSION DRAWS A DISTINCTION , ON THE BASIS OF THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF JULY IN CASE 114/JACQUEMART V COMMISSION (( ) ECR ), BETWEEN GEOGRAPHICAL WEIGHTINGS AS PROVIDED FOR BY THE FIRST AND SECOND PARAGRAPHS OF ARTICLE AND WEIGHTINGS FIXED BY THE COUNCIL PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS COMPRISING THE REMUNERATION OF OFFICIALS EMPLOYED AT THE VARIOUS SEATS OF THE COMMUNITIES . THE COMMISSION CONTENDS THAT ALTHOUGH THE GEOGRAPHICAL WEIGHTINGS DO NOT FORM PART OF THE BASIC SALARY , THE SAME DOES NOT APPLY IN THE CASE OF THE SECOND TYPE OF WEIGHTING .   AS THE COURT STATED IN THE JUDGMENT CITED ABOVE , THE FUNCTION OF THE WEIGHTING MENTIONED IN ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS IS TO ENSURE THAT THE REMUNERATION OF ALL OFFICIALS HAS THE SAME PURCHASING POWER , WHATEVER THEIR PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT . ON THE OTHER HAND , THE WEIGHTING MENTIONED IN ARTICLE IS A MEANS AVAILABLE TO THE COUNCIL FOR ADJUSTING THE REMUNERATION OF ALL OFFICIALS AND SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES .   THE SECOND KIND OF WEIGHTING , AS PART OF THE MACHINERY FOR ADJUSTING THE REMUNERATION OF OFFICIALS EMPLOYED AT THE SEATS OF THE COMMUNITIES , IS INTENDED BY VIRTUE OF ITS VERY FUNCTION TO BE MERGED WITH THE BASIC SALARY , HAVING REGARD TO THE FACT THAT IT WAS ADOPTED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE REMUNERATION BY ITS APPLICATION TO THE AMOUNTS SHOWN IN THE TABLE CONTAINED IN ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS .   THAT TABLE IS THE SOLE BASIS FOR DETERMINING THE BASIC SALARY , UPON ESTABLISHMENT , ONLY IN CASES WHERE THE AMOUNTS SHOWN THEREIN HAVE NOT IN FACT HAD THE WEIGHTING REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS APPLIED TO THEM . THE BASIC SALARY IS ARRIVED AT EITHER BY THE UPDATING OF THOSE     AMOUNTS BY APPLICATION OF THE WEIGHTING , AS WAS THE CASE FROM TO , OR BY AN ADJUSTMENT OF THE TABLE CONTAINED IN ARTICLE BY INCORPORATION OF THE WEIGHTING , AS IS THE CASE FOR THE PERIOD AFTER JANUARY .    IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT THIS DEFINITION OF THE TERM ' ' BASIC SALARY ' '  AVOIDS THE ILLOGICAL CONSEQUENCE OF RECOGNIZING DIFFERENT SENIORITY FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE COMMUNITY PENSION SCHEME DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE VARIATIONS IN THE COST OF LIVING OCCURRING AFTER THE ADOPTION OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS WERE INCORPORATED IN THE FIGURES SHOWN IN THE TABLE CONTAINED IN ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   MOREOVER , THE APPLICANT ' S ARGUMENT TO THE EFFECT THAT APPLICATION OF THE WEIGHTINGS HAS LED TO DISCRIMINATION OR ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES AFFECTING HIM TAKES NO ACCOUNT OF THE CLEAR AND PRECISE NATURE OF THE DISTINCTION DRAWN IN THE STAFF REGULATIONS BETWEEN GEOGRAPHICAL WEIGHTINGS AND THOSE PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE .    IT MUST BE MADE CLEAR THAT THE BASIC SALARY , AS PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , COMPRISES THE AMOUNTS SHOWN IN THE TABLE CONTAINED IN THAT PROVISION , ADJUSTED WHERE APPROPRIATE BY THE WEIGHTING ADOPTED FOR THE SEATS OF THE COMMUNITIES BY THE COUNCIL IN THE LIGHT OF THE ANNUAL REVIEW PROVIDED FOR BY ARTICLE , AND THE MEANING OF THE EXPRESSION ' ' BASIC SALARY ' '  CANNOT VARY FROM ONE PROVISION TO ANOTHER IN THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTIVE CONSIDERATIONS JUSTIFYING SUCH A DIFFERENCE .   THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY JUSTIFICATION FOR ATTRIBUTING A MEANING DIFFERENT FROM THAT LAID DOWN BY THE COURT IN THE CASE CITED ABOVE TO THE EXPRESSION ' ' BASIC SALARY ATTACHING TO THE GRADE ON ESTABLISHMENT ' '  FOR THE PURPOSE OF CALCULATING THE NUMBER OF YEARS OF PENSIONABLE SERVICE WITH WHICH AN OFFICIAL IS TO BE CREDITED ON THE BASIS OF THE AMOUNT OF THE ACTUARIAL EQUIVALENT OR THE SUMS REPAID REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE ( ) OF ANNEX VIII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   IT IS THEREFORE APPROPRIATE TO CONCLUDE THAT THE COMMISSION PROPERLY INTERPRETED THE TERM ' ' BASIC SALARY ' ' , FOR THE PURPOSE OF CALCULATING THE NUMBER OF YEARS OF PENSIONABLE SERVICE TO BE CREDITED TO THE APPLICANT ON THE BASIS OF THE AMOUNT OF THE ACTUARIAL EQUIVALENT OR SUMS REPAID , AS INCLUDING THE WEIGHTING PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .       IT FOLLOWS THAT THE APPLICATION MUST BE DISMISSED AS UNFOUNDED .  
Decision on costs
UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .   THE APPLICANT HAS FAILED IN HIS SUBMISSIONS .   HOWEVER , UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE INSTITUTIONS IN ACTIONS BY SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES ARE TO BE BORNE BY THOSE INSTITUTIONS .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ( SECOND CHAMBER )   HEREBY :   . DISMISSES THE APPLICATION ;  . ORDERS THE PARTIES TO BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .
