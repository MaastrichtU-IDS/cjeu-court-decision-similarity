IN CASE 23/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE ARBEIDSRECHTBANK ( LABOUR COURT ) TONGEREN FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  MICHEL JANSSEN, A SELF-EMPLOYED PERSON, RESIDENT AT REKEM,  AND  ALLIANCE NATIONALE DES MUTUALITES CHRETIENNES, BRUSSELS  
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE PLACED ON THE CONCEPT OF " ASSIMILATED " WORKERS REFERRED TO IN CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF REGULATIONS NOS AND OF THE COUNCIL ON SOCIAL SECURITY FOR MIGRANT WORKERS, 
Grounds
BY DECISION OF APRIL 1971, RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON MAY 1971, THE ARBEIDSRECHTBANK TONGEREN REFERRED TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY A QUESTION OF INTERPRETATION CONCERNING THE WORD " ASSIMILATED " USED IN REGULATIONS NOS AND OF THE EEC COUNCIL .  THE COURT IS FIRST ASKED TO RULE WHETHER THE CONCEPT OF " ASSIMILATED " WORKERS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SAID COUNCIL REGULATIONS CAN APPLY TO " HELPERS " WHOM BELGIAN LEGISLATION ON THE SUBJECT OF SICKNESS AND INVALIDITY INSURANCE TREATS AS SELF-EMPLOYED PERSONS .  THE SCOPE OF REGULATION NO IS SET OUT, AS REGARDS THE PERSONS TO WHOM IT APPLIES, BY ARTICLE 4, WHICH PROVIDES THAT " THE PROVISIONS OF THIS REGULATION SHALL APPLY TO WAGE-EARNERS OR ASSIMILATED WORKERS WHO ARE OR HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO THE LEGISLATION OF ONE OR MORE OF THE MEMBER STATES ... ".  REFERENCE IS MADE TO THAT PROVISION IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 4, WHICH WAS ADOPTED TO IMPLEMENT REGULATION NO .  THIS PROVISION IS BASED ON A WIDE CONCEPTION OF THE PERSONS TO WHOM IT APPLIES INASMUCH AS IT SUBJECTS TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE REGULATION NOT ONLY WAGE-EARNERS WITHIN THE STRICT SENSE OF THE WORD BUT IN ADDITION ALL THOSE ASSIMILATED TO SUCH WORKERS .  IN THIS RESPECT, ARTICLE FOLLOWS A GENERAL TENDENCY OF THE SOCIAL LAW OF MEMBER STATES TO EXTEND THE BENEFITS OF SOCIAL SECURITY IN FAVOUR OF NEW CATEGORIES OF PERSONS BY REASON OF IDENTICAL RISKS .  HOWEVER, THE EXACT MEASURE OF THIS ASSIMILATION CAN ONLY BE DETERMINED IN TERMS OF THE NATIONAL LEGISLATIONS TO WHICH REGULATION NO REFERS .  SUCH AN ASSIMILATION TAKES PLACE ON EVERY OCCASION ON WHICH, AS THE RESULT OF THE EFFECT OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION, THE PROVISIONS OF A GENERAL SCHEME OF SOCIAL SECURITY ARE EXTENDED TO A CATEGORY OF PERSONS OTHER THAN THE WAGE-EARNERS REFERRED TO BY THE SAID REGULATION, WHATEVER MAY BE THE FORMS OR METHODS EMPLOYED BY THE NATIONAL LEGISLATURE .  THE EXTENSION OF THESE PROVISIONS MUST ENTITLE THOSE BENEFITING FROM IT TO A DEGREE OF PROTECTION AGAINST ONE OR MORE RISKS COMPARABLE TO THAT GRANTED IN RESPECT OF THE RISK CONCERNED UNDER THE GENERAL SCHEME .  THE QUESTION SUBMITTED MAY, HOWEVER, ALSO BE INTENDED TO DETERMINE WHETHER A PERSON WHO IS TREATED AS " HELPER " UNDER BELGIAN LEGISLATION GOVERNING SICKNESS AND INVALIDITY INSURANCE CAN AVAIL HIMSELF OF COMPLETED INSURANCE PERIODS AS A WAGE-EARNER UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF ANOTHER MEMBER STATE, IN ORDER TO CLAIM ADVANTAGES, SUCH AS BEING EXCUSED A QUALIFYING PERIOD, WHICH, UNDER THE PROVISIONS ON THE SUBJECT OF SICKNESS AND INVALIDITY INSURANCE FOR SELF-EMPLOYED PERSONS, ARE ADDED TO THE PERIODS PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED UNDER BELGIAN LEGISLATION AS A WAGE-EARNER .  ARTICLES TO OF THE TREATY, WHICH ESTABLISH FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT FOR WORKERS GAVE A COMMUNITY MEANING TO THE CONCEPT OF WORKER .  AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THE REGULATION NO 3, THE EXPRESSION " WAGE-EARNERS OR ASSIMILATED WORKERS ", USED IN THE REGULATION AND DESIGNED TO CLARIFY THE CONCEPT OF " WORKERS ", COVERS NOT ONLY THOSE WHO, IN THIS CAPACITY, ARE SUBJECT TO THE LEGISLATION OF ONE OR MORE MEMBER STATES BUT ALSO THOSE WHO " HAVE BEEN " SO SUBJECT .  THE OBJECT OF ARTICLES TO WOULD NOT BE ACHIEVED BUT WOULD BE MISSED IF THE INSURANCE PERIOD COMPLETED BY A WORKER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LEGISLATION OF ONE MEMBER STATE, WERE, AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED, LOST IF, IN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT SECURED FOR HIM, HE CHANGES HIS PLACE OF WORK AND THUS BECOMES SUBJECT TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM OF ANOTHER MEMBER STATE .  FOR THE PURPOSES OF ADMISSION TO COMPULSORY INSURANCE, THIS CONCLUSION IS FURTHER CONFIRMED BY ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 3, WHICH PROVIDES THAT THE INSURANCE PERIODS AND ASSIMILATED PERIODS COMPLETED UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF ONE OR MORE MEMBER STATES OTHER THAN THAT IN WHICH THE INSURED IS PERMANENTLY RESIDENT SHALL, IN SO FAR AS IS NECESSARY, BE RECKONED AS INSURANCE PERIODS COMPLETED UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF THE LATTER STATE .  IT THEREFORE FOLLOWS THAT WHEN THE LEGISLATION OF A MEMBER STATE GOVERNING THE BENEFITS TO BE GRANTED TO SELF-EMPLOYED PERSONS ALLOWS INSURANCE PERIODS COMPLETED BY THE INSURED PERSON UNDER THE SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEME FOR WAGE-EARNERS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN ESTABLISHING A RIGHT TO BENEFIT, THE INSURANCE PERIODS COMPLETED AS A WAGE-EARNER UNDER THE SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEME OF ANOTHER MEMBER STATE MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN APPLYING THAT LEGISLATION .

Operative part
THE COURT  IN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION SUBMITTED TO IT BY THE ARBEIDSRECHTBANK TONGEREN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DECISION TAKEN BY THAT COURT ON APRIL 1971, HEREBY RULES :  . THE CONCEPT OF AN " ASSIMILATED " WORKER USED IN REGULATIONS NOS AND OF THE COUNCIL INCLUDES A " HELPER ", WITHIN THE MEANING OF BELGIAN LEGISLATION, CONSIDERED AS A SELF-EMPLOYED PERSON IN SO FAR AS, UNDER THAT LEGISLATION, THE BENEFITS OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEME PROVIDED FOR WAGE-EARNERS AS A WHOLE AGAINST ONE OR MORE RISKS IS EXTENDED TO HIM, PROVIDED THAT, IN RESPECT OF THE RISK CONCERNED, THE EXTENSION ENSURES THAT HE RECEIVES PROTECTION COMPARABLE TO THAT PROVIDED UNDER THE GENERAL SCHEME;  . WHEN THE LEGISLATION OF A MEMBER STATE GOVERNING THE BENEFITS AVAILABLE TO SELF-EMPLOYED PERSONS ALLOWS THE INSURANCE PERIODS COMPLETED BY THE INSURED PERSON UNDER THE SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEME FOR WAGE-EARNERS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN ESTABLISHING THE RIGHT TO BENEFIT, THE INSURANCE PERIODS COMPLETED AS A WAGE-EARNER UNDER THE SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEME OF ANOTHER MEMBER STATE MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN APPLYING THAT LEGISLATION .
