Summary
DIRECTIVES 70/, 74/AND 79/CONSTITUTE A COHERENT SYSTEM COVERING THE MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING OF COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS INCLUDING THE QUESTION OF ADDITIVES AND UNDESIRABLE SUBSTANCES , WHICH THEY REGULATE IN AN EXHAUSTIVE MANNER . FEEDINGSTUFFS SATISFYING THE REQUIREMENTS LAID DOWN BY THOSE DIRECTIVES SHOULD BE ABLE TO CIRCULATE FREELY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY , SUBJECT TO THE UNILATERAL MEASURES WHICH THE MEMBER STATES MAY ADOPT USING THE EMERGENCY PROCEDURES PROVIDED FOR BY DIRECTIVES 70/AND 74/. IT FOLLOWS THAT A MEMBER STATE CANNOT INVOKE ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY TO JUSTIFY NATIONAL MEASURES NOT PROVIDED FOR BY THE DIRECTIVES AND CONSTITUTING AN OBSTACLE TO IMPORTS THAT CONCERN THE PERMITTED LEVEL IN THOSE FEEDINGSTUFFS OF SUBSTANCES FALLING WITHIN THE CATEGORY OF ADDITIVES OR UNDESIRABLE SUBSTANCES . ONLY THE PROCEDURES PROVIDED FOR IN DIRECTIVES 70/AND 74/MAY BE USED TO RESOLVE ANY PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEMS WITH WHICH A MEMBER STATE ALLEGES IT MUST DEAL . BY ACTING UNILATERALLY OUTSIDE THOSE PROCEDURES A MEMBER STATE NOT ONLY DEROGATES FROM THE DIVISION OF POWERS LAID DOWN BY THE DIRECTIVES PURSUANT TO THE EEC TREATY BUT ALSO INFRINGES THE PRINCIPLE OF THE FREE MOVEMENT OF GOODS SET OUT IN ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY AND CONFIRMED BY THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE THREE DIRECTIVES IN QUESTION .

Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT , BY ADOPTING RULES LAYING DOWN MINIMUM IRON CONTENTS AND MAXIMUM PERMITTED LEVELS OF SODIUM IN FEEDINGSTUFFS , THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER DIRECTIVES 70/524/EEC , 74/63/EEC AND 79/373/EEC AND UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JANUARY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY HAD FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 70/524/EEC OF NOVEMBER CONCERNING ADDITIVES IN FEEDINGSTUFFS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( III ), P . ; HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' THE ADDITIVES DIRECTIVE ' ), COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 74/63/EEC OF DECEMBER ON THE FIXING OF MAXIMUM PERMITTED LEVELS FOR UNDESIRABLE SUBSTANCES AND PRODUCTS IN FEEDINGSTUFFS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ; HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' THE UNDESIRABLE SUBSTANCES DIRECTIVE ' ) AND COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 79/373/EEC OF APRIL ON THE MARKETING OF COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ; HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' THE COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS DIRECTIVE ' ), AND UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY , BY PROVIDING IN THE GERMAN RULES CONCERNING FEEDINGSTUFFS FOR MINIMUM IRON CONTENTS AND MAXIMUM PERMITTED LEVELS OF SODIUM IN FEEDINGSTUFFS .  THE BACKGROUND TO THE DISPUTE  PARAGRAPH OF THE FUTTERMITTELVERORDNUNG ( FEEDINGSTUFFS REGULATION ) OF JUNE WAS AMENDED BY THE DRITTE VERORDNUNG ZUR ANDERUNG DER FUTTERMITTELVERORDNUNG ( THIRD REGULATION AMENDING THE FEEDINGSTUFFS REGULATION ) OF JULY ( BUNDESGESETZBLATT I , P . ), WHICH INTRODUCED A NEW SUBPARAGRAPH LAYING DOWN A MINIMUM IRON CONTENT AND A MAXIMUM PERMITTED LEVEL OF SODIUM FOR MILK-REPLACER FEED INTENDED FOR USE AS COMPLETE FEEDINGSTUFFS FOR THE REARING OF CALVES . THAT PROVISION , WHICH IS NOW CONTAINED IN PARAGRAPH ( ) OF THE FUTTERMITTELVERORDNUNG OF APRIL ( BUNDESGESETZBLATT I , P . ), PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS :    ' MILK-REPLACER FEED INTENDED FOR USE AS COMPLETE FEEDINGSTUFFS FOR CALF-REARING MUST CONTAIN AT LEAST MG OF IRON PER KG . MILK-REPLACER FEED INTENDED FOR USE AS COMPLETE FEEDINGSTUFFS FOR THE FATTENING OF CALVES UP TO APPROXIMATELY KG IN WEIGHT MUST CONTAIN AT LEAST MG OF IRON PER KG . MILK-REPLACER FEED INTENDED FOR USE AS COMPLETE FEEDINGSTUFFS FOR THE FATTENING OF CALVES MAY CONTAIN NO MORE THAN MG OF SODIUM PER KG . IN EACH CASE THE CONTENT LEVEL RELATES TO DRY MATTER OF MILK-REPLACER FEED ' .  ACCORDING TO PARAGRAPH ( ) OF THE FUTTERMITTELGESETZ ( LAW ON FEEDINGSTUFFS ) OF JULY ( BUNDESGESETZBLATT I , P . ) FEEDINGSTUFFS WHICH FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS IN FORCE MAY NOT BE INTRODUCED INTO THE TERRITORY IN WHICH THE LAW IS APPLICABLE .  AFTER THE NEW PROVISIONS OF THE FUTTERMITTELVERORDNUNG HAD COME INTO FORCE THE COMMISSION DREW THE ATTENTION OF THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT , BY TWO LETTERS DATED FEBRUARY AND MARCH , TO THE INCOMPATIBILITY OF THOSE PROVISIONS WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED DIRECTIVES AND WITH ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY . BY TWO COMMUNICATIONS DATED MARCH AND MAY THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT SET OUT THE FACTUAL AND LEGAL GROUNDS THAT , IN ITS VIEW , SERVED TO JUSTIFY THE MEASURE TO WHICH THE COMMISSION OBJECTED . ON APRIL THE COMMISSION THEREUPON DELIVERED A REASONED OPINION TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY .  IN SEPTEMBER , AFTER THE DELIVERY OF THAT OPINION , THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT SUBMITTED TO THE COMMISSION WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS DIRECTIVE A PROPOSAL INTENDED FOR THE WORKING PARTY ON FEEDINGSTUFFS LEGISLATION , ESTABLISHED UNDER THAT DIRECTIVE , FOR THE ADOPTION OF PROVISIONS TO THE SAME EFFECT AS THE RULES WHICH ARE THE SUBJECT OF THIS CASE . ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE COMMISSION , WHICH WAS NOT DISPUTED BY THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT , THE REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL THE OTHER MEMBER STATES PARTICIPATING IN THE WORKING PARTY CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS NOT NECESSARY TO AMEND THE EXISTING COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES . THE OBJECTIVE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE ARGUMENTS PUT FORWARD BY THE GERMAN DELEGATION WITH REGARD TO IRON AND SODIUM WAS NOT DISPUTED BUT THE MEMBERS OF THE WORKING PARTY TOOK THE VIEW THAT THE QUESTION RAISED BY THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT COULD BE RESOLVED WITHOUT SERIOUS DIFFICULTY BY THE PROVISION OF MORE INFORMATION TO THE MANUFACTURERS OF FEEDINGSTUFFS AND BREEDERS .  THE ARGUMENTS SUBMITTED BY THE PARTIES  THE COMMISSION CONTENDS , IN ESSENCE , THAT THE THREE DIRECTIVES CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE AND EXHAUSTIVE SET OF RULES COVERING THE WHOLE FIELD OF PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OF COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS , INCLUDING QUESTIONS OF PUBLIC HEALTH WHICH MAY BE RAISED BY THE USE OF CERTAIN INGREDIENTS . ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF THE ADDITIVES DIRECTIVE , ARTICLE OF THE UNDESIRABLE SUBSTANCES DIRECTIVE AND ARTICLE OF THE COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS DIRECTIVE , PRODUCTS WHICH CONFORM TO THE STANDARDS LAID DOWN BY THE COMMISSION OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO CIRCULATE FREELY SUBJECT ONLY TO THE EMERGENCY MEASURES PROVIDED FOR BY ARTICLE OF THE ADDITIVES DIRECTIVE AND ARTICLE OF THE UNDESIRABLE SUBSTANCES DIRECTIVE . A MEMBER STATE IS THEREFORE UNABLE , SAVE IN THE EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES LAID DOWN BY THOSE DIRECTIVES , TO ADOPT UNILATERALLY MEASURES CONCERNING THE COMPOSITION OF FEEDINGSTUFFS THAT HAVE THE EFFECT OF CREATING OBSTACLES TO THE MARKETING OF FEEDINGSTUFFS IN OTHER MEMBER STATES . IN THE COMMISSION ' S VIEW THE COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS DIRECTIVE CLEARLY SHOWS THAT THE COMMUNITY LEGISLATURE DID NOT INTEND TO PRESCRIBE TO MANUFACTURERS OF FEEDINGSTUFFS WHAT HAD TO BE CONTAINED IN THEIR PRODUCTS BUT DID INTEND , IN PRINCIPLE , TO ENABLE PRODUCTS WHATEVER THEIR COMPOSITION TO BE MARKETED FREELY IN THE COMMUNITY .  MORE SPECIFICALLY , THE COMMISSION CONTENDS THAT THE QUESTION OF THE IRON CONTENT OF COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS IS GOVERNED BY THE ADDITIVES DIRECTIVE AND THE FIXING OF THE PERMITTED LEVEL OF SODIUM IS GOVERNED BY THE UNDESIRABLE SUBSTANCES DIRECTIVE . THE QUESTIONS RAISED BY THE GERMAN RULES SHOULD THEREFORE HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF ONE OR OTHER OF THOSE TWO DIRECTIVES , WHICH THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT HAS CONSISTENTLY REFUSED TO ACCEPT SINCE IT BASED ITS ARGUMENTS EXCLUSIVELY ON THE COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS DIRECTIVE .  IN ITS DEFENCE THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY EXPLAINS THE REASON FOR THE ADOPTION OF THE MEASURE TO WHICH THE COMMISSION OBJECTS . ITS PURPOSE IS TO PROHIBIT CERTAIN UNDESIRABLE PRACTICES IN THE FEEDING OF CALVES . ONE SUCH PRACTICE IS THE USE OF FEEDINGSTUFFS WHICH ARE DEFICIENT IN IRON TO INDUCE ARTIFICIAL ANAEMIA IN CALVES SO AS TO PRODUCE A WHITE MEAT WHICH IS PARTICULARLY HIGHLY REGARDED BY CONSUMERS ; THE OTHER PRACTICE IS THE ADMINISTERING OF EXCESSIVE QUANTITIES OF SALT SO AS TO MAKE THE CALVES ARTIFICIALLY THIRSTY WHICH CAUSES THEM TO ABSORB EXCESSIVE QUANTITIES OF LIQUID FEEDINGSTUFFS IN ORDER TO INCREASE THEIR SLAUGHTER LIVEWEIGHT .  FROM A LEGAL POINT OF VIEW THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT ' S ARGUMENTS MAY BE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS :    ( A ) ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY , OR , IN THE FORM RELEVANT TO THIS CASE , THE PRINCIPLE OF MINIMUM INTERVENTION , WHEN INTERPRETING MEASURES OF SECONDARY COMMUNITY LAW WHICH ENCROACH UPON THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE MEMBER STATES , PREFERENCE SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE INTERPRETATION WHICH KEEPS THE INTERVENTION TO A MINIMUM .   ( B)IN ADDITION TO ADDITIVES AND UNDESIRABLE SUBSTANCES , THE USE OR PRESENCE OF WHICH IS THE SPECIFIC SUBJECT OF DIRECTIVES 70/AND 74/, IT IS NECESSARY TO TAKE ACCOUNT , FOR THE PURPOSE OF APPLYING THOSE DIRECTIVES , OF THE RULES RELATING TO ' CONSTITUENT ELEMENTS ' , THAT IS TO SAY THE SUBSTANCES WHICH ESSENTIALLY DETERMINE THE QUALITY OF FEEDINGSTUFFS . SINCE THE QUESTION OF THE COMPOSITION OF FEEDINGSTUFFS IS NOT REGULATED BY THE DIRECTIVE IN QUESTION , THAT IS TO SAY THE COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS DIRECTIVE , THAT QUESTION CONTINUES TO LIE WITHIN THE REMIT OF THE MEMBER STATES . IT IS FOR THAT REASON THAT THE RULES OF WHICH THE COMMISSION COMPLAINS ARE JUSTIFIED . MOREOVER , ARTICLE OF THE COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS DIRECTIVE EXPRESSLY RESERVED TO THE MEMBER STATES THE POWER TO LIMIT THE MARKETING OF COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS TO THOSE WHICH ARE OBTAINED FROM CERTAIN INGREDIENTS OR WHICH ARE FREE FROM CERTAIN INGREDIENTS .   ( C)THE CONTESTED MEASURE IS JUSTIFIED FOR THE PROTECTION OF ANIMAL HEALTH , WHICH FALLS WITHIN THE POWERS RESERVED TO THE MEMBER STATES BY ARTICLE . THAT POWER IS REAFFIRMED IN ARTICLE OF THE COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS DIRECTIVE ACCORDING TO WHICH THE MEMBER STATES MUST ENSURE THAT COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS ARE WHOLESOME AND DO NOT REPRESENT A DANGER TO HEALTH .   ( D)FINALLY , THE COMMISSION MISINTERPRETED ARTICLE OF THE COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS DIRECTIVE WHICH REQUIRES IT , ON THE BASIS OF EXPERIENCE ACQUIRED , TO FORWARD TO THE COUNCIL WITHIN A CERTAIN PERIOD PROPOSALS FOR AMENDMENTS TO THE DIRECTIVE SUCH AS TO ACHIEVE FREE MOVEMENT OF COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS AND TO ELIMINATE CERTAIN DISPARITIES CONCERNING IN PARTICULAR THE USE OF INGREDIENTS . SINCE THE COMMISSION HAS NOT TAKEN APPROPRIATE STEPS , THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT IS AUTHORIZED TO ADOPT AT NATIONAL LEVEL SUCH MEASURES AS IT CONSIDERS NECESSARY .  SUBSTANCE  BEFORE EXAMINING THE ARGUMENTS PUT FORWARD BY THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY IT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE CERTAIN PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS REGARDING THE GENERAL BACKGROUND TO THE AFOREMENTIONED DIRECTIVES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY .  FIRST , IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE THREE DIRECTIVES ARE BASED ON ARTICLES AND OF THE EEC TREATY . IN OTHER WORDS THEY FORM PART OF THE FRAMEWORK OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY AND AT THE SAME TIME THAT OF THE HARMONIZATION OF LEGISLATION CAPABLE OF DIRECTLY AFFECTING THE FUNCTIONING OF THE COMMON MARKET . IN VIEW OF THAT DUAL LEGAL BASIS THE PURPOSE OF THE DIRECTIVES IS TO CONTRIBUTE SPECIFICALLY IN THE AREA IN QUESTION TO ACHIEVING THE FREE MOVEMENT OF GOODS WHICH IS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE COMMON MARKET .  ALTHOUGH THE DIRECTIVES CAME INTO FORCE OVER A PERIOD OF TIME FROM TO THEY FORM A COHERENT SYSTEM , AS IS CLEAR FROM THE FIRST TWO RECITALS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE PREAMBLES . ACCORDING TO THOSE RECITALS THE COMMON OBJECTIVE OF THE DIRECTIVES IS TO INCREASE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY BY PROMOTING THE QUALITY OF ANIMAL PRODUCTION BY MEANS OF THE USE OF ' APPROPRIATE GOOD-QUALITY FEEDINGSTUFFS ' . WITHIN THAT FRAMEWORK THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE OF THE ADDITIVES DIRECTIVE AND THE UNDESIRABLE SUBSTANCES DIRECTIVE IS TO DEFINE THOSE ASPECTS WHICH REQUIRE PARTICULAR SUPERVISION ON ACCOUNT , IN PARTICULAR , OF THEIR EFFECT ON ANIMAL OR HUMAN HEALTH ( SEE THE FIFTH TO ELEVENTH RECITALS IN THE PREAMBLE TO THE ADDITIVES DIRECTIVE AND THE THIRD AND EIGHTH RECITALS IN THE PREAMBLE TO THE UNDESIRABLE SUBSTANCES DIRECTIVE ). EACH OF THOSE DIRECTIVES PROVIDES FOR A COMMUNITY PROCEDURE FOR LAYING DOWN SPECIAL RULES , WHETHER IN THE FORM OF MAXIMUM OR MINIMUM CONTENTS OR IN THE FORM OF PROHIBITIONS , WHICH ARE CONTAINED IN THE ANNEXES TO THOSE DIRECTIVES ( SEE ARTICLE OF THE ADDITIVES DIRECTIVE , AS AMENDED BY COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 73/103/EEC OF APRIL , OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . , AND ARTICLE OF THE UNDESIRABLE SUBSTANCES DIRECTIVE ).  IN ADDITION , THE ADDITIVES DIRECTIVE AND THE UNDESIRABLE SUBSTANCES DIRECTIVE BOTH PROVIDE FOR THE PROVISIONAL ADOPTION OF EMERGENCY MEASURES BY THE MEMBER STATES IN THE EVENT OF DANGER TO ANIMAL OR HUMAN HEALTH ( ARTICLE OF THE ADDITIVES DIRECTIVE AND ARTICLE OF THE UNDESIRABLE SUBSTANCES DIRECTIVE ). ANY MEMBER STATE WHICH ADOPTS SUCH MEASURES MUST INFORM THE OTHER MEMBER STATES AND THE COMMISSION WITHOUT DELAY . SUCH NOTIFICATION SETS IN MOTION A PROCEDURE UNDER WHICH APPROPRIATE MEASURES MAY BE ADOPTED AT COMMUNITY LEVEL .  IT THEREFORE APPEARS THAT , IN RELATION TO ALL CONSTITUENTS CAPABLE OF GIVING RISE TO PROBLEMS OR DANGERS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF PROPER ANIMAL NUTRITION OR FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF ANIMAL OR HUMAN HEALTH , THE TWO DIRECTIVES HAVE SET UP A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM WHICH ENABLES ACCOUNT TO BE TAKEN OF THE NEED TO AMEND THE DIRECTIVES PERIODICALLY AND OF URGENT PROBLEMS WHICH MAY ARISE IN PRACTICE .  THE COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS DIRECTIVE RELATES , AS IS CLEAR FROM ITS TITLE , TO THE MARKETING OF COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS . IN THAT CONNECTION IT LAYS DOWN A NUMBER OF RULES CONCERNING PACKAGING OF FEEDINGSTUFFS AND THE INFORMATION RELATING TO THEIR COMPOSITION CONTAINED ON THEIR LABELLING OR IN THE ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS .  ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF THE COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS DIRECTIVE :    ' MEMBER STATES SHALL PRESCRIBE THAT COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS MAY BE MARKETED ONLY IF THEY ARE WHOLESOME , UNADULTERATED AND OF MERCHANTABLE QUALITY . THEY SHALL ALSO PRESCRIBE THAT COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS MAY NOT REPRESENT A DANGER TO ANIMAL OR HUMAN HEALTH AND MAY NOT BE PRESENTED OR MARKETED IN A MANNER LIABLE TO MISLEAD ' .  ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS :    ' IN SO FAR AS THEIR NATIONAL LAWS SO PROVIDE AT THE TIME OF ADOPTION OF THIS DIRECTIVE , MEMBER STATES SHALL BE AUTHORIZED TO LIMIT THE MARKETING OF COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS TO THOSE :   OBTAINED FROM CERTAIN INGREDIENTS , OR  FREE FROM CERTAIN INGREDIENTS ' .  ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE RESERVES TO THE MEMBER STATES THE RIGHT , INTER ALIA , ' TO RECOMMEND TYPES OF COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS WHICH MEET CERTAIN ANALYTICAL CHARACTERISTICS ' .  FINALLY , ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE REQUIRES THE COMMISSION , ON THE BASIS OF EXPERIENCE ACQUIRED , TO FORWARD TO THE COUNCIL , NOT LATER THAN THREE YEARS FOLLOWING NOTIFICATION OF THE DIRECTIVE , ' PROPOSALS FOR AMENDMENTS TO THE DIRECTIVE SUCH AS TO ACHIEVE FREE MOVEMENT OF COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS AND TO ELIMINATE CERTAIN DISPARITIES CONCERNING THE USE OF INGREDIENTS AND LABELLING IN PARTICULAR ' .  EACH OF THE DIRECTIVES CONTAINS A PROVISION ACCORDING TO WHICH COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS WHICH CONFORM TO THE DIRECTIVE IN QUESTION MAY NOT BE SUBJECTED TO ANY MARKETING RESTRICTIONS OTHER THAN THOSE PROVIDED FOR IN THE DIRECTIVE ITSELF ( ARTICLE OF THE ADDITIVES DIRECTIVE , ARTICLE OF THE UNDESIRABLE SUBSTANCES DIRECTIVE AND ARTICLE OF THE COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS DIRECTIVE ). THEY THEREFORE CONSTITUTE A COHERENT SYSTEM COVERING THE MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING OF COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS , INCLUDING THE QUESTION OF ADDITIVES AND UNDESIRABLE SUBSTANCES .  THE DEFENCE PUT FORWARD BY THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY MUST THEREFORE BE EXAMINED IN THE LIGHT OF THOSE CONSIDERATIONS .  ( A ) WITH REGARD TO THE ARGUMENT BASED ON THE ' PRINCIPLE OF MINIMUM INTERVENTION '  IT SHOULD BE STATED THAT THAT METHOD OF INTERPRETATION OVERLOOKS THE FACT THAT THE DIRECTIVES IN QUESTION FORM PART OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY AND ARE INTENDED TO FACILITATE THE FREE MOVEMENT OF FEEDINGSTUFFS WITHIN THE COMMON MARKET . THEY MUST THEREFORE BE INTERPRETED IN THE LIGHT OF THEIR OBJECTIVES , WHICH ARE TO IMPROVE LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY ACCORDING TO COMMON RULES AND AT THE SAME TIME TO ELIMINATE THE OBSTACLES ARISING FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE RELEVANT NATIONAL LEGISLATION .  ( B ) THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ' CONSTITUENT ELEMENTS ' , ON THE ONE HAND , AND ' ADDITIVES '  AND ' UNDESIRABLE SUBSTANCES ' , ON THE OTHER , ALSO OVERLOOKS THE COHERENT SCHEME OF THE THREE DIRECTIVES . IN PRINCIPLE , COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS SHOULD BE ABLE TO CIRCULATE FREELY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY IF THEY SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS DIRECTIVE AND IF THEY ALSO COMPLY WITH THE RULES LAID DOWN BY THE ADDITIVES DIRECTIVE AND THE UNDESIRABLE SUBSTANCES DIRECTIVE . THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT WAS WRONG TO TRY TO CONFINE THE ARGUMENT TO THE COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS DIRECTIVE BY REFUSING TO DEAL WITH THE MATTERS WHICH ARE THE SUBJECT OF THE CONTESTED PROVISIONS OF THE FUTTERMITTELVERORDNUNG BY MEANS OF THE PROCEDURES PROVIDED FOR BY THE ADDITIVES DIRECTIVE AND THE UNDESIRABLE SUBSTANCES DIRECTIVE , EVEN THOUGH THE TWO SUBSTANCES IN QUESTION , IRON AND SODIUM , FALL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF ONE OR THE OTHER OF THOSE TWO DIRECTIVES . ACCORDING TO THOSE DIRECTIVES THE MEMBER STATES MAY ADOPT UNILATERAL MEASURES ONLY BY FOLLOWING THE EMERGENCY PROCEDURE . THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER ASSERTED THAT THE CONTESTED PROVISIONS OF THE FUTTERMITTELVERORDNUNG WERE A MATTER OF URGENCY .  WITH REGARD TO ARTICLE OF THE COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS DIRECTIVE IT SUFFICES TO NOTE THAT THE RESERVATION CONTAINED THEREIN IS RESTRICTED TO THE APPLICATION OF NATIONAL LAW IN FORCE ' AT THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS DIRECTIVE ' , THAT IS TO SAY APRIL . THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY CANNOT RELY ON THAT PROVISION TO JUSTIFY A MEASURE ADOPTED AFTER THAT DATE .  ( C ) WITH REGARD TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY ' S RELIANCE ON ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY , WHICH AUTHORIZES THE MEMBER STATES TO MAINTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON IMPORTS JUSTIFIED ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION OF HEALTH AND LIFE OF HUMANS AND ANIMALS , IT FOLLOWS FROM THE SCHEME OF THE ADDITIVES DIRECTIVE AND THE UNDESIRABLE SUBSTANCES DIRECTIVE THAT QUESTIONS OF PUBLIC HEALTH RELATING TO THE USE OF SUBSTANCES COVERED BY THE DIRECTIVES ARE REGULATED EXHAUSTIVELY BY THOSE DIRECTIVES . IN THAT RESPECT , THEREFORE , A MEMBER STATE MAY NO LONGER RELY ON THE EXCEPTION CONTAINED IN ARTICLE AS IS CLEAR FROM THE COURT ' S ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW ( SEE PRIMARILY THE JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER , CASE 5/TEDESCHI V DENKAVIT ( ) ECR , PARAGRAPH OF THE DECISION ). ONLY THE PROCEDURES PROVIDED FOR BY THE ADDITIVES DIRECTIVE AND THE UNDESIRABLE SUBSTANCES DIRECTIVE COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO RESOLVE ANY PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEMS TO WHICH THE CONTESTED MEASURE IS ALLEGED TO BE ADDRESSED .  THE ARGUMENT BASED ON ARTICLE OF THE COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS DIRECTIVE CANNOT BE ACCEPTED EITHER , SINCE THAT PROVISION CAN HAVE NEITHER THE PURPOSE NOR THE EFFECT OF DEROGATING FROM THE EXHAUSTIVE NATURE OF THE ADDITIVES DIRECTIVE AND THE UNDESIRABLE SUBSTANCES DIRECTIVE .  ( D ) WITH REGARD TO THE CHARGE THAT THE COMMISSION FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE OF THE COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS DIRECTIVE , IT SUFFICES TO OBSERVE THAT THAT PROVISION , WHICH IS OF A GENERAL NATURE , DOES NOT IN ANY WAY OBLIGE THE COMMISSION TO TAKE UP ON ITS OWN ACCOUNT , IN THE FORM OF PROPOSALS , THE PROVISIONS ADOPTED UNILATERALLY BY THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY . THE COMMISSION HAS A DISCRETION WITH REGARD TO THE STEPS IT TAKES TOWARDS AMENDING THE DIRECTIVE ; WITH REGARD TO THE CONTESTED MEASURES , THE DISCUSSION WITHIN THE WORKING PARTY ON FEEDINGSTUFFS LEGISLATION SHOWS THAT THE OTHER MEMBER STATES WERE NOTIN FAVOUR OF EXTENDING THE MEASURES ADOPTED UNILATERALLY BY THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY TO THE WHOLE OF THE COMMUNITY . ACCORDINGLY , THE COMMISSION CANNOT BE CRITICIZED FOR FAILING TO TAKE SUCH AN INITIATIVE ON ITS OWN AUTHORITY PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS DIRECTIVE .  IT APPEARS FROM ALL THE FOREGOING THAT THE MEASURE ADOPTED BY THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES DEROGATES FROM THE DIVISION OF POWERS LAID DOWN BY THE DIRECTIVES PURSUANT TO THE EEC TREATY SINCE A MEASURE OF THAT TYPE COULD HAVE BEEN ADOPTED ONLY FOR THE WHOLE OF THE COMMUNITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURES PROVIDED FOR BY THE ADDITIVES DIRECTIVE AND THE UNDESIRABLE SUBSTANCES DIRECTIVE . THE UNILATERAL ADOPTION OF THOSE MEASURES BY THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY ALSO CONSTITUTES AN INFRINGEMENT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE FREE MOVEMENT OF GOODS SET OUT IN ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY AND CONFIRMED BY THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE THREE DIRECTIVES .  IT MUST THEREFORE BE DECLARED THAT , BY LAYING DOWN , AS PART OF THE GERMAN LEGISLATION ON FEEDINGSTUFFS , MINIMUM IRON CONTENTS AND MAXIMUM PERMITTED LEVELS OF SODIUM IN FEEDINGSTUFFS , THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER COUNCIL DIRECTIVES 70/OF NOVEMBER CONCERNING ADDITIVES IN FEEDINGSTUFFS , 74/OF DECEMBER ON THE FIXING OF MAXIMUM PERMITTED LEVELS FOR UNDESIRABLE SUBSTANCES AND PRODUCTS IN FEEDINGSTUFFS AND 79/OF APRIL ON THE MARKETING OF COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS , AND UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY .  
Decision on costs
COSTS ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE PROVIDES THAT THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS . AS THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY HAS FAILED IN ITS SUBMISSIONS , IT MUST BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .

ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT  HEREBY :    ( ) DECLARES THAT , BY LAYING DOWN , AS PART OF THE GERMAN LEGISLATION ON FEEDINGSTUFFS , MINIMUM IRON CONTENTS AND MAXIMUM PERMITTED LEVELS OF SODIUM IN FEEDINGSTUFFS , THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER COUNCIL DIRECTIVES 70/524/EEC OF NOVEMBER CONCERNING ADDITIVES IN FEEDINGSTUFFS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( III ), P . ), 74/63/EEC OF DECEMBER ON THE FIXING OF MAXIMUM PERMITTED LEVELS FOR UNDESIRABLE SUBSTANCES AND PRODUCTS IN FEEDINGSTUFFS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) AND 79/373/EEC OF APRIL ON THE MARKETING OF COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), AND UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY .
