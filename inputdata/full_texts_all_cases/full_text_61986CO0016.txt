HEIM  AFTER HEARING THE OPINION OF THE ADVOCATE GENERAL,  MAKES THE FOLLOWING  ORDER  
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JANUARY 1986, MR G . P ., AN OFFICIAL OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS "THE ESC "), BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ESC OF OCTOBER REJECTING HIS COMPLAINT AGAINST THE FAILURE OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO AFFORD HIM ASSISTANCE UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS, AND FOR COMPENSATION FOR THE NON-MATERIAL DAMAGE WHICH HE CLAIMS TO HAVE SUFFERED ON ACCOUNT OF THAT FAILURE .  THE DOCUMENTS BEFORE THE COURT SHOW THAT MR P . COMPLAINS, IN ESSENCE, OF HAVING BEEN SINCE THE SUBJECT OF INSULTS AND THREATS FROM ANOTHER OFFICIAL OF THE ESC, MR V . D . G . ACCORDINGLY, BY A MEMORANDUM OF JULY ADDRESSED TO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ESC, MR P . INFORMED HIM THAT, AT THE GENERAL STAFF MEETING OF JUNE 1983, MR V . D . G . HAD CRITICIZED HIM IN OFFENSIVE TERMS AND HAD CAST ASPERSIONS ON HIS PROFESSIONAL INTEGRITY AND PERSONAL ABILITIES . THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE ESC REPLIED TO THE MEMORANDUM ON SEPTEMBER 1983, SAYING THAT HE HAD HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH MR V . D . G . REGARDING THE INCIDENT IN QUESTION AND HAD ADDRESSED TO HIM "THE REMARKS THAT WERE CALLED FOR" ON THE MATTER . THE LETTER CONCLUDED : "HAVING THUS ACTED ON YOUR REQUEST CONCERNING THE OFFICIAL COMPLAINED OF, I REGARD THE MATTER AS CLOSED ".  ON JUNE MR P . SUBMITTED A COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS "AGAINST THE FACT THAT THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY DID NOT CONSIDER ITSELF TO BE UNDER A DUTY TO TAKE ACTION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS IN ORDER TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS IN RESPECT OF THE THREATS, INSULTS AND ABUSE" TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN EXPOSED .  THAT COMPLAINT WAS REJECTED BY A DECISION OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ESC OF OCTOBER 1985, ON THE GROUNDS THAT MR P . HAD FAILED TO SPECIFY EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF DECISION HE EXPECTED FROM THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY . FOLLOWING THAT REJECTION, MR P . BROUGHT THE PRESENT ACTION .  UNDER ARTICLE 92*() OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE COURT MAY AT ANY TIME CONSIDER WHETHER THERE EXISTS ANY ABSOLUTE BAR TO PROCEEDING WITH A CASE, AND MUST GIVE ITS DECISION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 91*() AND ( ) THEREOF . IN THE LIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE, THE COURT HAS DECIDED TO AVAIL ITSELF OF THOSE PROVISIONS AND TO MAKE A SEPARATE ORDER AS TO THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION, WITHOUT OPENING THE ORAL PROCEDURE .  ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS MAKE THE ADMISSIBILITY OF AN ACTION BROUGHT BY AN OFFICIAL AGAINST THE INSTITUTION TO WHICH HE BELONGS CONDITIONAL ON THE PROPER OBSERVANCE OF THE PRELIMINARY ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE LAID DOWN THEREUNDER . IF, AS IN THIS CASE, THE OFFICIAL WISHES THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY TO TAKE A DECISION RELATING TO HIM, THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE MUST BE OPENED BY A REQUEST FROM THE PERSON CONCERNED ASKING THE AUTHORITY TO TAKE THE DECISION WHICH HE SEEKS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 90*() OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS . IT IS ONLY AGAINST A DECISION REJECTING THAT REQUEST, WHICH, IN THE ABSENCE OF A REPLY FROM THE ADMINISTRATION, IS DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN AFTER A PERIOD OF FOUR MONTHS, THAT THE PERSON CONCERNED MAY, WITHIN A FURTHER PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS, SUBMIT A COMPLAINT TO THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 90*().  AS THE ESC HAS RIGHTLY ARGUED, THE SUCCESSIVE STEPS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE, WHICH ARE MANDATORY UNDER THE STAFF REGULATIONS, HAVE NOT BEEN FOLLOWED IN THIS CASE .  THE APPLICANT' S COMPLAINT, LODGED ON JUNE 1985, WAS NOT PRECEDED BY A REQUEST UNDER ARTICLE 90*() OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS . CONSEQUENTLY, THE APPLICANT FAILED TO INFORM THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE MEASURES WHICH IT SHOULD HAVE ADOPTED WITH REGARD TO HIM . HIS MEMORANDUM OF JULY TO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ESC CANNOT, FOR THE PURPOSES OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, BE REGARDED AS SUCH A REQUEST . THE APPLICANT HIMSELF HAS STATED THAT, IN ORDER TO CALM THE SITUATION, HE HAD CONTENTED HIMSELF AT THE TIME WITH THE REPLY FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AND HAD THEREFORE NOT INTENDED TO TAKE THE MATTER ANY FURTHER . IN ANY EVENT, THE LETTER FROM THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF SEPTEMBER 1983, IN REPLY TO THE MEMORANDUM OF JULY 1983, WAS NOT FOLLOWED BY A COMPLAINT WITHIN THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 90*(). THE COMPLAINT SUBMITTED ON JUNE WAS CLEARLY OUT OF TIME .  IT FOLLOWS THAT THE APPLICATION TO THE COURT WAS NOT PRECEDED BY THE PROPER ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE AND MUST THEREFORE BE DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE IN ITS ENTIRETY, INCLUDING THE CLAIM FOR DAMAGES .
