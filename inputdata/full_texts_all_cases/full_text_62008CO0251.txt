Re: 
Appeal against the order of the Court of First Instance (Fifth Chamber) of April in Case T-412/Ayyanarsamy
 v 
Commission
and Germany
, by which that Court dismissed, partly on the ground of manifest inadmissibility and partly on the ground of manifest lack
                  of jurisdiction, the action seeking, first, annulment of the Commission’s letter of September informing the appellant
                  that it could not intervene in his favour before the German courts and, secondly, payment of compensation for the damage allegedly
                  suffered by the appellant by reason of the conduct of the German authorities – Infringement of the rights of individuals arising
                  from Articles EC and EC – Concept of challengeable act for the purposes of Article EC.
               
Operative part 
1.
	The appeal is dismissed as being in part manifestly inadmissible and in part manifestly unfounded.
2.
	Mr Ayyanarsamy is ordered to bear his own costs.
