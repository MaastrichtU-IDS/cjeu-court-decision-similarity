Summary
. ALTHOUGH IN PRINCIPLE A SELECTION BOARD CANNOT VALIDLY PERFORM ITS DUTIES WHEN ONE OF ITS MEMBERS IS ABSENT , THE NEED TO ENSURE THE CONTINUITY OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE MAY HOWEVER JUSTIFY RELAXING THIS PRINCIPLE IF IT PROVES IMPOSSIBLE TO ENSURE OTHERWISE THAT THE SELECTION BOARD FUNCTIONS .  . THE FACT THAT ONE CANDIDATE IS PUT AT AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE BY THE CHOICE OF THE SUBJECT FOR THE WRITTEN TEST IN A COMPETITION IS AN INFRINGEMENT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE EQUALITY OF TREATMENT OF THE CANDIDATES SUCH AS TO VITIATE  THE SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURE IN THE COMPETITION . THIS IS SO WHERE THE CONCRETE WAY IN WHICH THE SUBJECT IS DEFINED ENABLES A CANDIDATE TO PROFIT FROM THE SPECIAL EXPERIENCE HE HAS ACQUIRED IN THE PERFORMANCE , AS A MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF , OF THE DUTIES RELATING TO THE POST PUT UP FOR COMPETITION .
