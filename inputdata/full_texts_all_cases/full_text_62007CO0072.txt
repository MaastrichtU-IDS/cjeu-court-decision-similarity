Re: 
Reference for preliminary ruling – Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Asturias – Interpretation of Article EC – Regulations
                  laying down conditions required to open new pharmacies.
               
Operative part:
The references for preliminary rulings made by the Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Asturias, by decisions of November
         and January 2007, are manifestly inadmissible.
