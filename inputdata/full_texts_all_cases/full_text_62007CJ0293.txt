         the Hellenic Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 4(1) and (2), in conjunction with the first sentence
         of Article 4(4) of that directive, as amended by Article 6(2) to (4) of Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21May on the conservation
         of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora;
      
2.      Dismisses the remainder of the action;
