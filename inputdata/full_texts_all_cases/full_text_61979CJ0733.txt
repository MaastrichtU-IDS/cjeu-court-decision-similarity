Summary
. THE REGULATIONS ON SOCIAL SECURITY FOR MIGRANT WORKERS DID NOT SET UP A COMMON SCHEME OF SOCIAL SECURITY , BUT ALLOWED DIFFERENT SCHEMES TO EXIST , CREATING DIFFERENT CLAIMS ON DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS AGAINST WHICH THE CLAIMANT POSSESSES DIRECT RIGHTS BY VIRTUE EITHER OF NATIONAL LAW ALONE OR OF NATIONAL LAW SUPPLEMENTED , WHERE NECESSARY , BY COMMUNITY LAW . THE COMMUNITY RULES CANNOT , THEREFORE , IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EXPRESS EXCEPTION CONSISTENT WITH THE AIMS OF THE TREATY , BE APPLIED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO DEPRIVE A MIGRANT WORKER OR HIS DEPENDANTS OF THE BENEFIT OF A PART OF THE LEGISLATION OF A MEMBER STATE , NOR MAY THEY BRING ABOUT A REDUCTION IN THE BENEFITS AWARDED BY VIRTUE OF THAT LEGISLATION SUPPLEMENTED BY COMMUNITY LAW .    . ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) ( I ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/MUST BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT ENTITLEMENT TO FAMILY BENEFITS FROM THE STATE IN WHOSE TERRITORY THE RECIPIENT OF AN INVALIDITY PENSION RESIDES DOES NOT TAKE AWAY     THE RIGHT TO HIGHER BENEFITS AWARDED PREVIOUSLY BY ANOTHER MEMBER STATE . IF THE AMOUNT OF FAMILY BENEFITS ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE WORKER IN THE MEMBER STATE IN WHICH HE RESIDES IS LESS THAN THE AMOUNT OF THE BENEFITS PROVIDED FOR BY THE LEGISLATION OF THE OTHER MEMBER STATE , HE IS ENTITLED TO A SUPPLEMENT TO THE BENEFITS FROM THE COMPETENT INSTITUTION OF THE LATTER STATE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AMOUNTS .

IN CASE 733/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE TRIBUNAL DU TRAVAIL ( LABOUR TRIBUNAL ) DE CHARLEROI , FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  CAISSE DE COMPENSATION DES ALLOCATIONS FAMILIALES DES REGIONS DE CHARLEROI ET DE NAMUR ( FAMILY ALLOWANCES COMPENSATION FUND FOR THE CHARLEROI AND NAMUR REGIONS )   AND  COSIMO LATERZA  
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE GIVEN TO ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) ( I ) OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1408/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE APPLICATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEMES TO EMPLOYED PERSONS AND THEIR FAMILIES MOVING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P . ), 
Grounds
BY A JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER THE TRIBUNAL DU TRAVAIL DE CHARLEROI REFERRED TO THE COURT , PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY , A QUESTION ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) ( I ) OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1408/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE APPLICATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEMES TO EMPLOYED PERSONS AND THEIR FAMILIES MOVING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P . ).   THIS QUESTION WAS RAISED IN AN ACTION RELATING TO THE DECISION OF THE COMPETENT BELGIAN SOCIAL SECURITY INSTITUTION NOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AN ITALIAN WORKER IN RECEIPT OF A BELGIAN INVALIDITY PENSION AND RESIDING IN ITALY WAS ENTITLED , AS FROM OCTOBER , TO BELGIAN ALLOWANCES FOR DEPENDENT CHILDREN AND TO ORDER HIM TO REPAY THE ALLOWANCES PAID FROM THE SAID DATE TO OCTOBER .    THE FILE FORWARDED BY THE NATIONAL COURT SHOWS THAT THE WORKER IN QUESTION , AFTER WORKING IN ITALY FROM TO AND IN BELGIUM FROM TO , WAS ON JUNE AWARDED AN INVALIDITY PENSION UNDER BELGIAN LEGISLATION ALONE AND UNTIL OCTOBER RECEIVED THE ALLOWANCES FOR DEPENDENT CHILDREN PROVIDED FOR BY THAT LEGISLATION . MR LATERZA ' S ENTITLEMENT TO THESE ALLOWANCES WAS GOVERNED UP TO THE AFORESAID DATE BY ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO UNDER THE PROVISIONS WHEREOF ' ' BENEFICIARIES OF A PENSION DUE IN PURSUANCE OF THE LEGISLATION OF ONE MEMBER STATE ONLY , AND WHO PERMANENTLY RESIDE IN THE TERRITORY OF ANOTHER MEMBER STATE ARE ENTITLED TO FAMILY ALLOWANCES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE LEGISLATION OF THE COUNTRY LIABLE FOR PAYMENT OF THE PENSION AS THOUGH THEY WERE PERMANENTLY RESIDENT IN THAT COUNTRY ' ' . PARAGRAPH ( ) OF THE SAID ARTICLE GOES ON TO SAY THAT THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH ( ) ' ' APPLY IRRESPECTIVE OF THE MEMBER STATE IN WHOSE TERRITORY THE CHILDREN RESIDE ' ' .       AFTER THE BELGIAN SOCIAL SECURITY INSTITUTION HAD ON JUNE LAID THE FILE RELATING TO THIS INVALIDITY PROVISION BEFORE THE COMPETENT ITALIAN AUTHORITIES AND REQUESTED THEM TO TAKE OVER THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR A PROPORTION OF THE INVALIDITY PENSION IN PURSUANCE OF THE COMMUNITY LAW PROVISIONS RELATING TO AGGREGATION AND APPORTIONMENT , THE ITALIAN SOCIAL SECURITY INSTITUTION , ON DECEMBER , AWARDED THE WORKER , ON THE BASIS OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/, A PROPORTIONAL PENSION AND ALSO THE FAMILY ALLOWANCES PROVIDED FOR BY ITALIAN LEGISLATION AS FROM THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE SAID REGULATION , THAT IS TO SAY FROM OCTOBER .    ON THE BASIS OF THE GRANT OF THOSE BENEFITS THE BELGIAN INSTITUTION REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF THE INVALIDITY PENSION PAID UP TO OCTOBER BY THE AMOUNT OF THE SAID PROPORTIONAL PENSION , DECIDED TO STOP PAYMENT OF THE ALLOWANCES FOR DEPENDENT CHILDREN PROVIDED FOR UNDER BELGIAN LEGISLATION AS FROM THAT DATE , AND AT THE SAME TIME SOUGHT REPAYMENT FROM MR LATERZA OF THE ALLOWANCES PAID UP TO OCTOBER ( NAMELY BFR ), THE DATE WHEN THE PAYMENT OF THOSE BENEFITS HAD BEEN SUSPENDED PENDING THE DECISION OF THE ITALIAN AUTHORITIES ON THE AWARD OF A PROPORTIONAL PENSION . IN SUPPORT OF ITS DECISION THE BELGIAN SOCIAL SECURITY INSTITUTION REFERRED TO THE PROVISION OF ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) ( I ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/ACCORDING TO WHICH FAMILY ALLOWANCES FOR PERSONS RECEIVING PENSIONS FOR OLD AGE , INVALIDITY OR AN ACCIDENT AT WORK OR OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE ARE TO BE GRANTED IRRESPECTIVE OF THE MEMBER STATE IN WHOSE TERRITORY THE PENSIONER OR THE CHILDREN ARE RESIDING :    ' ' ( B ) TO A PENSIONER WHO DRAWS PENSIONS UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF MORE THAN ONE MEMBER STATE :    ( I ) IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LEGISLATION OF WHICHEVER OF THESE STATES HE RESIDES IN PROVIDED THAT . . . A RIGHT TO ONE OF THE BENEFITS REFERRED TO IN PARAGRAPH IS ACQUIRED UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF THAT STATE ' ' .   MR LATERZA CHALLENGES THE BASIS OF THIS DECISION . SINCE THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCES FOR DEPENDENT CHILDREN PROVIDED FOR BY ITALIAN LEGISLATION IS LESS THAN THAT OF THE BELGIAN ALLOWANCES , HE POINTS OUT THAT THE ABOVE-MENTIONED DECISION LEADS IN THIS CASE TO HIS RIGHTS TO FAMILY BENEFITS BEING REDUCED AND MAINTAINS THAT THE PROVISIONS IN QUESTION CANNOT BE INTERPRETED AND APPLIED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO TAKE AWAY FROM THE INSURED PERSON HIS RIGHT TO THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF BENEFITS PAYABLE TO HIM UNDER THE LAW OF A MEMBER STATE , THE OBJECTIVES OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY AND OF REGULATION NO 1408/BEING DISREGARDED .       IT IS IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS DISPUTE THAT THE TRIBUNAL DU TRAVAIL DE CHARLEROI HAS ASKED THE COURT TO RULE WHETHER ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) ( I ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/' ' MUST BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT ENTITLEMENT TO FAMILY BENEFITS FROM THE MEMBER STATE IN WHOSE TERRITORY THE RECIPIENT OF AN INVALIDITY PENSION RESIDES ( IN THIS CASE ITALY ) TAKES AWAY THE RIGHT TO HIGHER FAMILY BENEFITS AWARDED PREVIOUSLY , BY ANOTHER MEMBER STATE ( IN THIS CASE BELGIUM ) ' ' .   AS THE COURT STATED IN ITS JUDGMENT OF MARCH ( CASE 100/, CLAUDINO ROSSI V CAISSE DE COMPENSATION POUR ALLOCATIONS FAMILIALES DES REGIONS DE CHARLEROI ET NAMUR ( ) ECR ) THE REGULATIONS ON SOCIAL SECURITY FOR MIGRANT WORKERS DID NOT SET UP A COMMON SCHEME OF SOCIAL SECURITY , BUT ' ' ALLOWED DIFFERENT SCHEMES TO EXIST , CREATING DIFFERENT CLAIMS ON DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS AGAINST WHICH THE CLAIMANT POSSESSES DIRECT RIGHTS BY VIRTUE EITHER OF NATIONAL LAW ALONE OR OF NATIONAL LAW SUPPLEMENTED , WHERE NECESSARY , BY COMMUNITY LAW ' ' . IN THE SAME CASE THE COURT ALSO STATED THAT ' ' THE COMMUNITY RULES COULD NOT , IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EXPRESS EXCEPTION CONSISTENT WITH THE AIMS OF THE TREATY , BE APPLIED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO DEPRIVE A MIGRANT WORKER OR HIS DEPENDANTS OF THE BENEFIT OF A PART OF THE LEGISLATION OF A MEMBER STATE ' '  OR TO LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN THE BENEFITS PAYABLE BY VIRTUE OF THAT LEGISLATION SUPPLEMENTED BY COMMUNITY LAW . IN LAYING DOWN AND DEVELOPING THE RULES FOR COORDINATING NATIONAL LAWS REGULATION NO 1408/IS IN FACT GUIDED BY THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE STATED IN THE SEVENTH AND EIGHT RECITALS OF THE PREAMBLE TO THE REGULATION , THAT THE AFORESAID RULES MUST GUARANTEE TO WORKERS WHO MOVE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY ALL THE BENEFITS WHICH HAVE ACCRUED TO THEM IN THE VARIOUS MEMBER STATES WHILST LIMITING THEM ' ' TO THE GREATEST AMOUNT ' '  OF SUCH BENEFITS .   IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE PRINCIPLES THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) ( I ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/CANNOT BE APPLIED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO DEPRIVE THE WORKER , BY SUBSTITUTING THE BENEFITS PROVIDED BY ONE MEMBER STATE FOR THE BENEFITS PAYABLE BY ANOTHER MEMBER STATE , OF THE MOST FAVOURABLE BENEFITS . THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF REGULATION NO 1408/REQUIRE ON THE OTHER HAND THAT WHERE , IN THE CASE COVERED BY ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) ( I ), THE AMOUNT OF THE BENEFITS PROVIDED BY THE MEMBER STATE IN WHICH THE WORKER IS RESIDING IS LESS THAN THAT OF THE BENEFITS AWARDED BY THE OTHER STATE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THEM THE WORKER CONTINUES TO BE ENTITLED TO THE GREATEST AMOUNT AND RECEIVES     FROM THE COMPETENT SOCIAL SECURITY INSTITUTION OF THIS LATTER MEMBER STATE A SUPPLEMENT TO THE BENEFITS EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AMOUNTS .   FOR THESE REASONS THE ANSWER SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE QUESTION REFERRED TO THE COURT THAT ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) ( I ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/MUST BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT ENTITLEMENT TO FAMILY BENEFITS FROM THE STATE IN WHOSE TERRITORY THE RECIPIENT OF AN INVALIDITY PENSION RESIDES DOES NOT TAKE AWAY THE RIGHT TO HIGHER BENEFITS AWARDED PREVIOUSLY BY ANOTHER MEMBER STATE . IF THE AMOUNT OF FAMILY BENEFITS ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE WORKER IN THE MEMBER STATE IN WHICH HE RESIDES IS LESS THAN THE AMOUNT OF THE BENEFITS PROVIDED FOR BY THE LEGISLATION OF THE OTHER MEMBER STATE , HE IS ENTITLED TO A SUPPLEMENT TO THE BENEFITS FROM THE COMPETENT INSTITUTION OF THE LATTER MEMBER STATE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AMOUNTS .  
Decision on costs

Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ( FIRST CHAMBER )   IN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION REFERRED TO IT BY THE TRIBUNAL DU TRAVAIL DE CHARLEROI , BY JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER , HEREBY RULES :   ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) ( I ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/MUST BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT ENTITLEMENT TO FAMILY BENEFITS FROM THE STATE IN WHOSE TERRITORY THE RECIPIENT OF AN INVALIDITY PENSION RESIDES DOES NOT TAKE AWAY THE RIGHT TO HIGHER BENEFITS AWARDED PREVIOUSLY BY ANOTHER MEMBER STATE . IF THE AMOUNT OF FAMILY BENEFITS ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE WORKER IN     THE MEMBER STATE IN WHICH HE RESIDES IS LESS THAN THE AMOUNT OF THE BENEFITS PROVIDED FOR BY THE LEGISLATION OF THE OTHER MEMBER STATE , HE IS ENTITLED TO A SUPPLEMENT TO THE BENEFITS FROM THE COMPETENT INSTITUTION OF THE LATTER STATE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AMOUNTS .
