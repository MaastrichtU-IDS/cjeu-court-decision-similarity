Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE APPOINTMENT MADE BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ON SEPTEMBER TO TILL THE VACANCY WHICH WAS THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF INTERNAL COMPETITION A/. 
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED ON MARCH THE APPLICANT CLAIMED THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION APPOINTING MR ROGER WURTH TAKEN BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ON SEPTEMBER AS A RESULT OF INTERNAL COMPETITION A/.  THIS DECISION WAS TAKEN BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT IN PLACE OF THE DECISION APPOINTING MR GERARD KIEFFER TAKEN ON FEBRUARY AS A RESULT OF THE SAME INTERNAL COMPETITION AND ANNULLED BY THE COURT IN ITS JUDGMENT OF JULY IN CASE 77/, BERTHOLD KUSTER V EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ( ) ECR .    THE APPLICANT ALLEGES THAT TO COMPLY WITH THIS JUDGMENT THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY OUGHT TO HAVE WITHDRAWN NOT ONLY THE DECISION APPOINTING MR GERARD KIEFFER BUT ALSO THE WHOLE COMPETITION ON WHICH IT WAS BASED AND ACCORDINGLY TO HAVE ORGANIZED A NEW RECRUITMENT PROCEDURE TO FILL THE VACANCY .   SINCE THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY HAS CONFINED ITSELF TO SUBSTITUTING THE APPOINTMENT OF MR ROGER WURTH FOR THAT OF MR GERARD KIEFFER IT HAS , ACCORDING TO THE APPLICANT , DISREGARDED ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY AND THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EAEC TREATY .   FURTHER THE APPLICANT MAINTAINS THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL IRREGULARITIES IN THE APPOINTMENT OF MR ROGER WURTH .  ADMISSIBILITY   THE DEFENDANT OBJECTS THAT THE ACTION IS INADMISSIBLE IN SO FAR AS THE APPLICANT CLAIMS THAT THE DECISION IN QUESTION HAS BEEN TAKEN BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT IN DISREGARD OF THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF JULY IN CASE 77/.    IN ITS OPINION THAT JUDGMENT DOES NOT INVOLVE THE ANNULMENT OF INTERNAL COMPETITION A/BUT ONLY OF THE APPOINTMENT OF MR GERARD KIEFFER OF FEBRUARY , SO THAT THE CLAIMS IN THE PRESENT ACTION ARE IN THIS RESPECT INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE SCOPE OF THE SAID JUDGMENT .   IT CANNOT BE CONTESTED THAT THOSE TO WHOM A JUDGMENT OF THE COURT ANNULLING AN ACT OF AN INSTITUTION IS ADDRESSED ARE DIRECTLY CONCERNED WITH THE WAY IN WHICH THE INSTITUTION EXECUTES THE JUDGMENT .   THEY ARE THEREFORE ENTITLED TO REQUEST THE COURT TO RULE ON ANY FAILURE BY THE INSTITUTION TO PERFORM ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE PROVISIONS APPLICABLE .   FOR THESE REASONS THE ACTION MUST BE DECLARED ADMISSIBLE .  SUBSTANCE   ( ) THE APPLICANT MAINTAINS THAT TO CONFORM WITH THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF JULY IN CASE 77/THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT OUGHT TO HAVE INITIATED A NEW RECRUITMENT PROCEDURE TO FILL THE VACANCY .   IT IS ALLEGED THAT IT IS ALL THE MORE NECESSARY TO INITIATE SUCH PROCEDURE SINCE THE JUDGMENT OF JULY GAVE A RULING ON ONLY ONE CLAIM IN THE ACTION AND THUS DID NOT SETTLE THE WHOLE QUESTION CONCERNING THE REGULARITY OF COMPETITION A/.    ACCORDING TO THE AFORESAID JUDGMENT THE APPLICANT CLAIMED THAT THE COURT SHOULD ' RULE THAT THE PROMOTION WHICH TOOK PLACE ON THE BASIS OF COMPETITION A/IS IRREGULAR AND ILLEGAL AND ACCORDINGLY ANNUL THE SAME ' .   THE PART OF THE JUDGMENT HEADED ' LAW '  BEGINS WITH THE STATEMENT THAT THE APPLICANT IS ASKING THE COURT ' TO ANNUL THE IMPLIED REJECTION . . . AND CONSEQUENTLY TO ANNUL THE APPOINTMENT OF MR GERARD KIEFFER . . . ' .   THE OPERATIVE PART OF THE JUDGMENT ' ANNULS THE APPOINTMENT OF MR GERARD KIEFFER RESULTING FROM COMPETITION A/' .   IT THUS CLEARLY APPEARS THAT THE JUDGMENT REGARDED THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE ACTION AS THE ANNULMENT OF THE APPOINTMENT OF MR KIEFFER AND AS CONCERNING THE COMPETITION PROCEDURE ONLY IN SO FAR AS THIS HAD LED TO THE APPOINTMENT AND JUDGMENT WAS GIVEN ACCORDINGLY .   THEREFORE THE SUBMISSION IS UNFOUNDED AND MUST BE REJECTED .   ( ) THE APPLICANT CLAIMS FURTHER THAT COMPETITION A/, WHICH LED TO THE CONTESTED APPOINTMENT , WAS CONDUCTED IRREGULARLY IN SEVERAL RESPECTS SUCH AS TO INVOLVE THE ANNULMENT OF THAT APPOINTMENT .   IN SUPPORT OF THE ACTION THE APPLICANT MAINTAINS THAT THE SELECTION BOARD FOR THIS COMPETITION WAS ILLEGALLY CONSTITUTED SINCE THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT HAD APPOINTED THE MEMBERS OF THE SELECTION BOARD UNDER A POWER DELEGATED FOR THIS PURPOSE BY THE BUREAU OF THE PARLIAMENT AND THAT THE DELEGATION WAS INVALID SINCE IT WAS NOT BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE STAFF IN THE MANNER LAID DOWN BY THE PROVISIONS OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   THE APPLICANT MAINTAINS THAT SUCH A DELEGATION WOULD HAVE BEEN VALID ONLY IF IT HAD BEEN POSTED UP OR PUBLISHED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS PROVIDES : ' ALL SUCH GENERAL PROVISIONS . . . SHALL BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE STAFF ' , BUT DOES NOT SPECIFY THE MANNER IN WHICH THIS MUST BE DONE .   ALTHOUGH ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS LAYS DOWN THE MANNER IN WHICH DECISIONS RELATING TO SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS ARE TO BE PUBLISHED , IT DOES NOT SPECIFY THE MANNER OF PUBLICATION OF ACTS WHICH HAVE A GENERAL SCOPE OR MEASURES WHICH RELATE TO A DIVISION OF POWERS WITHIN THE INSTITUTION .   THE DELEGATION OF POWER IN QUESTION INVOLVES A GENERALLY ACCEPTED DIVISION OF POWERS WITHIN THE INSTITUTION .   IN ANY EVENT IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT IT WAS NOTIFIED NOT ONLY TO THE DIRECTORS GENERAL OF THE INSTITUTION , THE CHAIRMAN OF GROUPS , THE SECRETARIAT AND THE CONTROL OFFICE , BUT ALSO TO THE STAFF COMMITTEE ESTABLISHED UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS WHICH PROVIDES THAT THE COMMITTEE SHALL , INTER ALIA , REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF THE STAFF VIS-A-VIS THEIR INSTITUTION AND ' MAINTAIN CONTINUOUS CONTACT BETWEEN THE INSTITUTION AND THE STAFF ' .   IN VIEW OF THIS THE CONTESTED DELEGATION OF POWER IS LEGALLY VALID WITHOUT ITS BEING NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WHETHER SUCH DELEGATION CONSTITUTES A MEASURE REFERRED TO BY THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   THE APPLICANT FURTHER MAINTAINS THAT THE MARKS AWARDED TO HIM BY THE SELECTION BOARD FOR THE COMPETITION DO NOT TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE FACT THAT HE HELD THE POST OF FIRST SECRETARY OF A COMMITTEE ON A TEMPORARY BASIS FROM SEPTEMBER TO MAY .    THE COMPETITION IN QUESTION WAS INITIATED BY NOTICE DATED NOVEMBER AND CLOSED ON FEBRUARY .    THUS AT THE TIME WHEN THE LIST OF SUITABLE CANDIDATES ON WHICH THE CONTESTED MEASURE IS BASED WAS DRAWN UP BY THE SELECTION BOARD FOR THE COMPETITION , THE APPLICANT WAS FILLING THE TEMPORARY POST WHICH HAD NOT YET BEEN THE SUBJECT OF A DECISION BY THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY REGARDING ' DETERMINATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE STATUS '  OF THE APPLICANT WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE THIRD PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT CANNOT BE MAINTAINED THAT THE SELECTION BOARD WAS BOUND , WHEN IT DREW UP THE LIST OF SUITABLE CANDIDATES , TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF SUCH A TEMPORARY POST WHICH AT THAT TIME WAS A DE FACTO SITUATION AND NOT YET SANCTIONED BY A FORMAL DECISION OF THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY RECORDED IN THE PERSONAL FILE OF THE APPLICANT .   MOREOVER IT APPEARS FROM STATEMENT SUPPLIED BY THE DEFENDANT WHICH THE APPLICANT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO REBUT THAT THE SELECTION BOARD WHEN IT DREW UP THE SAID LIST OF SUITABLE CANDIDATES DID IN FACT TAKE ACCOUNT OF ALL THE FEATURES OF FACT AND OF LAW RELATING TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE POSITION OF THE APPLICANT AT THE TIME .   THE APPLICANT FURTHER POINT OUT THAT THE CONTESTED DECISION IN REFERRING TO THE ' RESULT OF THE COMPETITION '  MENTIONS ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS RELATING TO PROMOTION AND EXPRESSLY STATES IN THE OPERATIVE PART THAT THE SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATE HAS BEEN ' PROMOTED '  TO THE VACANT POST .   FOR THIS REASON HE SAYS THAT THE SAID DECISION IS IRREGULAR BECAUSE IMPRECISE OR CONTRADICTORY REASONS ARE GIVEN FOR IT .   THE APPLICANT MOREOVER STATES THAT INSUFFICIENT REASONS ARE GIVEN FOR THE CONTESTED DECISION IN THAT IT CONTAINS NO REFERENCE TO THE OPINION OF THE BUREAU OBTAINED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ON THE PROPOSAL TO APPOINT MR ROGER WURTH .   THE RECRUITMENT PROCEDURE FOLLOWED IN THE PRESENT CASE CLEARLY SHOWS THAT THE APPOINTMENT IN QUESTION WAS MADE AS A RESULT OF AN INTERNAL COMPETITION AND THUS LEAVES NO DOUBT AS TO THE LEGAL BASIS OF THE ACT .   THEREFORE THE LACK OF PRECISION POINTED OUT IN THE STATEMENT OF REASONS IS NOT OF A DECISIVE NATURE AND CANNOT AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF THE CONTESTED DECISION .   FURTHER WITH REGARD TO THE ABSENCE FROM THE STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR THE DECISION IN QUESTION OF A REFERENCE TO THE OPINION OF THE BUREAU , HAVING REGARD TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT THE VALIDITY OF THE DECISION DEPENDS ON MENTION OF SUCH AN OPINION .   FOR THESE REASONS THE PRESENT APPLICATION MUST BE DISMISSED AS UNFOUNDED .
