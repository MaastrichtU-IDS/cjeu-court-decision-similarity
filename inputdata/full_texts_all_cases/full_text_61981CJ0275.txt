ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO OF THE COUNCIL OF SEPTEMBER CONCERNING SOCIAL SECURITY FOR MIGRANT WORKERS AND ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1408/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE APPLICATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEMES TO EMPLOYED PERSONS AND THEIR FAMILIES MOVING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY , 
Grounds
BY ORDER OF SEPTEMBER , WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON OCTOBER , THE CENTRALE RAAD VAN BEROEP ( COURT OF LAST INSTANCE IN SOCIAL SECURITY MATTERS ) REFERRED TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY A QUESTION ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO OF THE COUNCIL OF SEPTEMBER CONCERNING SOCIAL SECURITY FOR MIGRANT WORKERS ( JOURNAL OFFICIEL , P . ) AND ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1408/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE APPLICATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEMES TO EMPLOYED PERSONS AND THEIR FAMILIES MOVING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ) P . ) IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE NETHERLANDS LEGISLATION ON PENSIONS ARE COMPATIBLE WITH COMMUNITY LAW .   THE QUESTION WAS RAISED IN CONNECTION WITH A DISPUTE BETWEEN THE RAAD VAN ARBEID ( LABOUR COUNCIL ) ' S-HERTOGENBOSCH AND A NETHERLANDS NATIONAL , THE APPELLANT IN THE MAIN ACTION , WHOSE PENSION WAS REDUCED UNDER THE NETHERLANDS LEGISLATION .   THE APPELLANT IN THE MAIN ACTION WORKED IN THE NETHERLANDS FROM TO MAINLY AS A ROAD CONSTRUCTION WORKER . FROM SEPTEMBER TO AUGUST HE WAS ENGAGED IN THE SAME WORK IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY . AS FROM AUGUST , HE TOOK UP EMPLOYMENT AGAIN IN THE NETHERLANDS FOR FOUR MONTHS UNTIL HE BECAME INCAPACITATED FOR WORK . HE RECEIVED BENEFITS ON ACCOUNT OF HIS DISABILITY FROM NETHERLANDS AND GERMAN SOURCES . HIS WIFE , WHO IS ALSO A NETHERLANDS NATIONAL , WORKED IN THE NETHERLANDS FROM TO .        IN , ON REACHING THE AGE OF , HE RECEIVED ON OLD-AGE PENSION THE AMOUNT OF WHICH WAS HOWEVER REDUCED BY 18% UNDER THE NATIONAL LEGISLATION IN QUESTION .   UNDER THE LEGISLATION IN FORCE IN THE NETHERLANDS , THE ALGEMENE OUDERDOMSWET ( GENERAL LAW ON OLD AGE , HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' ' THE OLD-AGE LAW ' ' ) OF MAY AND ITS IMPLEMENTING DECREES , AN OLD-AGE PENSION IS IN PRINCIPLE GRANTED TO INSURED PERSONS WHO HAVE REACHED THE AGE OF . THE CATEGORY OF INSURED PERSONS INCLUDES PERSONS RESIDING IN THE NETHERLANDS BUT NOT PERSONS WHO RESIDE THERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT AND ARE ACCORDINGLY INSURED UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF FOREIGN LEGISLATION . SIMILARLY , A MARRIED WOMAN RESIDING IN THE NETHERLANDS WHOSE HUSBAND IS NOT INSURED UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE RELEVANT NETHERLANDS LEGISLATION IS NOT REGARDED AS INSURED . IN GENERAL , MARRIED WOMEN ARE NOT ENTITLED , AS SUCH , TO AN OLD-AGE PENSION . HOWEVER , A MARRIED MAN IS ENTITLED TO A HIGHER PENSION THAN A SINGLE PERSON . PROVISION IS ALSO MADE FOR THE PENSION TO BE REDUCED BY 1% FOR EACH FULL CALENDAR YEAR IN WHICH THE MARRIED MALE BENEFICIARY WAS NOT INSURED BETWEEN THE AGES OF AND YEARS . THE SAME REDUCTION APPLIED TO THE BENEFICIARY ' S WIFE FOR EACH CALENDAR YEAR , WITHIN THE SAME AGE BRACKET , IN WHICH SHE WAS NOT INSURED .   UNDER THAT LEGISLATION , THE APPELLANT ' S PENSION WAS REDUCED , INITIALLY BY 9% OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT IN RESPECT OF THE PERIOD OF NINE YEARS IN WHICH HE WAS INSURED IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY AND , SUBSEQUENTLY , BY 9% OF THE SAME AMOUNT ON THE GROUND THAT HIS WIFE HAD NOT BEEN INSURED DURING THE SAME PERIOD .   SINCE THE PROBLEM OF THE COMPATIBILITY OF THAT LEGISLATION WITH COMMUNITY LAW AND , IN PARTICULAR , WITH REGULATIONS NOS AND 1408/, WAS RAISED , THE CENTRALE RAAD VAN BEROEP STAYED THE PROCEEDINGS AND REFERRED TO THE COURT THE FOLLOWING QUESTION :    ' ' MUST THE RULE ( AS SET FORTH IN ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO AND ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/) ACCORDING TO WHICH A WORKER EMPLOYED IN THE TERRITORY OF A MEMBER STATE IS SUBJECT TO THE LEGISLATION OF THAT STATE BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT A NATIONAL PROVISION OF A MEMBER STATE IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THAT RULE IN PROVIDING THAT A MARRIED WOMAN WHO RESIDES IN THAT MEMBER STATE AND WHOSE HUSBAND IS NOT INSURED FOR THE     PURPOSES OF AN OLD-AGE PENSION BECAUSE HE IS SO INSURED UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF ANOTHER MEMBER STATE , IS NOT INSURED FOR SUCH PURPOSES EITHER , EVEN IF SHE HAS RESIDED IN THE TERRITORY OF THE FIRST-MENTIONED MEMBER STATE AND HAS BEEN EMPLOYED THERE?  ' '   IT IS NECESSARY TO OBSERVE THAT ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO AS WELL AS ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/BOTH LAY DOWN , IN VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL TERMS , THE PRINCIPLE THAT A WORKER IS SUBJECT THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OF HIS EMPLOYMENT TO THE LEGISLATION OF THE MEMBER STATE IN WHOSE TERRITORY HE WORKS .   HOWEVER , THE COURT HAS ALREADY POINTED OUT , IN ITS JUDGMENT OF APRIL IN CASE 110/COONAN ( ) ECR , THAT IT IS FOR THE LEGISLATURE OF EACH MEMBER STATE TO LAY DOWN THE CONDITIONS CREATING THE RIGHT OR THE OBLIGATION TO BECOME AFFILIATED TO A SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEME OR TO A PARTICULAR BRANCH UNDER SUCH A SCHEME .   IT MUST HOWEVER BE EMPHASIZED THAT ALTHOUGH THE MEMBER STATES ARE AT LIBERTY TO ADOPT RULES IN RESPECT OF QUESTIONS RELATING TO SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEMES , THEY ARE NONE THE LESS UNDER AN OBLIGATION TO COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF COMMUNITY LAW IN FORCE .   APART FROM COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 79/7/EEC OF DECEMBER ON THE PROGRESSIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL TREATMENT FOR MEN AND WOMEN IN MATTERS OF SOCIAL SECURITY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L P . ) WHICH ALLOWS THE MEMBER STATES A PERIOD OF SIX YEARS IN WHICH TO IMPLEMENT THE NECESSARY PROVISIONS , THERE IS NO RULE OF COMMUNITY LAW PRECLUDING THE MEMBER STATES FROM MAKING THE RIGHT OF EITHER SPOUSE TO DERIVE BENEFITS UNDER A SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEME DEPENDENT ON THE AFFILIATION OF THE OTHER SPOUSE TO THE SAME SCHEME .   CONSEQUENTLY , UNDER COMMUNITY LAW AS IT STANDS AT PRESENT , A NATIONAL PROVISION OF A MEMBER STATE WHICH PROVIDES THAT A MARRIED WOMAN RESIDING IN THAT MEMBER STATE WHOSE HUSBAND IS NOT INSURED THERE FOR THE PURPOSES OF AN OLD-AGE PENSION BECAUSE HE IS SO INSURED UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF ANOTHER MEMBER STATE , IS NOT INSURED FOR THOSE PURPOSES EITHER , IF SHE HAS RESIDED IN     THE TERRITORY OF THE FIRST-MENTIONED MEMBER STATE AND HAS BEEN EMPLOYED THERE , IS NOT INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF COMMUNITY LAW IN FORCE .
