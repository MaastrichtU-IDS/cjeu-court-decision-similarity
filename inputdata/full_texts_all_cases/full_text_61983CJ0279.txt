Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON DECEMBER THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAD FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THAT TREATY BY NOT ADOPTING WITHIN THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED THE MEASURES NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 79/OF DECEMBER AMENDING DIRECTIVE NO 76/ON MUTUAL     ASSISTANCE FOR THE RECOVERY OF CLAIMS RESULTING FROM OPERATIONS FORMING PART OF THE SYSTEM OF FINANCING OF THE EUROPEAN AGRICULTURAL GUIDANCE AND GUARANTEE FUND , AND OF AGRICULTURAL LEVIES AND CUSTOMS DUTIES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ).   DIRECTIVE NO 79/PROVIDES FOR THE EXTENSION TO VALUE-ADDED TAX OF THE SYSTEM OF MUTUAL ASSISTANCE BETWEEN THE MEMBER STATES , IN RELATION TO THE RECOVERY OF CLAIMS , ESTABLISHED BY DIRECTIVE NO 76/OF THE COUNCIL OF MARCH ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ). ARTICLE OF DIRECTIVE NO 79/REQUIRED MEMBER STATES TO TAKE THE MEASURES NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THE DIRECTIVE BY JANUARY .    THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DENY THAT IT HAS NOT FULFILLED THAT OBLIGATION . IT STATES THAT THE DELAY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DIRECTIVE IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE BILL INTRODUCED INTO THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT FOR THAT PURPOSE CAME TO NOTHING BECAUSE OF THE DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT . IT ADDS THAT A NEW BILL IS AT PRESENT IN THE PROCESS OF PREPARATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMPLEMENTING THE DIRECTIVE IN QUESTION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE .   THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES CANNOT EXPUNGE THE FAILURE WITH WHICH THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC IS CHARGED . THE COURT HAS CONSISTENTLY HELD THAT A MEMBER STATE CANNOT RELY ON PROVISIONS , PRACTICES OR SITUATIONS IN ITS INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM TO JUSTIFY A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OBLIGATIONS OR TIME-LIMITS IMPOSED BY COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES .   IT MUST THEREFORE BE DECLARED THAT BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED THE MEASURES NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 79/OF DECEMBER THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY .
