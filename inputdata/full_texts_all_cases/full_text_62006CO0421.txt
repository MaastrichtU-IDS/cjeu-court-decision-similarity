                  79/373/EEC on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs and repealing Commission Directive 91/357/EEC (OJ L 63, p. 23)

Operative part 
 
Article 1(4) of Directive 2002/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of January amending Council Directive
                     79/373/EEC on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs and repealing Commission Directive 91/357/EEC, which lays down an
                     obligation to indicate, on the labels of compound feedingstuffs for animals, the percentages in weight of the raw materials
                     of which the feedingstuff is composed with a tolerance of ± 15% of the declared value as regards those percentages, must be
                     interpreted as meaning that it does not contradict Articles and of Regulation (EC) No 178/of the European Parliament
                     and of the Council of January laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European
                     Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety, which are intended, inter alia, to prevent the
                     labelling and presentation of feedingstuffs for animals from misleading the consumer.
                  
 
Since Article 1(1)(b) of Directive 2002/laid down an independent obligation bearing no relation to the obligations laid
                     down by the other provisions of that directive, the Court’s declaration, in its judgment of December in Joined Cases
                     C‑453/03, C‑11/04, C‑12/and C‑194/ABNA and Others, that that provision was invalid did not create a legal vacuum or
                     a situation of inconsistency requiring the Community institutions to adopt the substantive amendments of Directive 2002/2.
                  
In any event, the invalidity of a Community provision results directly from the judgment of the Court declaring that invalidity
         and it is for the national authorities and courts of the Member States to draw the consequences from that declaration in their
         national legal order.
