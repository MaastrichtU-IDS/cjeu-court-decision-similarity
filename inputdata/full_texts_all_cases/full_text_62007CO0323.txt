                  Council Directive 92/50/EEC of June relating to the coordination of procedures for the award of public service contracts
                  (OJ L 209, p. 1) – Scope – National provisions attributing, outside of the procedures for the award of public works contracts
                  laid down in the directive, the management of heating installations of certain buildings in a commune to a municipal undertaking.
               
Operative part
Council Directive 92/50/EEC of June relating to the coordination of procedures for the award of public service contracts
         and Council Directive 93/36/EEC of June coordinating procedures for the award of public supply contracts do not apply
         to a contract concluded between a local authority and a person legally distinct from it, where the local authority exercises
         over the person concerned a control which is similar to that which it exercises over its own departments and, at the same
         time, that person carries out the essential part of its activities with the controlling local authority or authorities.
      
Article of Directive 92/is applicable only if there are laws, regulations or administrative provisions which have been
         published and which grant the beneficiary an exclusive right concerning the subject‑matter of the contract awarded.
