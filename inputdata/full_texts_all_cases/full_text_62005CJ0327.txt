Re: 
Failure of a Member State to fulfil obligations – Incorrect transposition of Council Directive 85/374/EEC of July on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for
                  defective products (OJ L 210, p. 29) – National legislation under which the distributor of a defective product may incur
                  liability in the same way as the manufacturer.
               
Operative part:
 
By adopting and maintaining in force provisions which make intermediaries in the distribution chain liable under the same
                     conditions as a manufacturer, contrary to Article 3(3) of Council Directive 85/374/EEC of July on the approximation
                     of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products, the
                     Kingdom of Denmark has failed to fulfil its obligations under that directive. 
                  
 
The Kingdom of Denmark is ordered to pay the costs.
