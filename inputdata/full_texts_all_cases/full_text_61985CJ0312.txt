Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE TERM ' FARMER PRACTISING FARMING AS HIS MAIN OCCUPATION '  WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 72/159/EEC OF APRIL ON THE MODERNIZATION OF FARMS , 
Grounds
BY AN ORDER OF JANUARY , RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON OCTOBER , THE TRIBUNALE AMMINISTRATIVO REGIONALE DELLA TOSCANA ( REGIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL OF TUSCANY ) REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY A QUESTION CONCERNING THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 72/159/EEC OF APRIL ON THE MODERNIZATION OF FARMS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P . ).  THE QUESTION AROSE IN THE COURSE OF PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY SPA VILLA BANFI , A COMPANY LIMITED BY SHARES , TO ANNUL A REFUSAL BY THE GIUNTA REGIONALE DI TOSCANA ( REGIONAL COUNCIL OF TUSCANY ) TO ALLOW IT TO PLANT NEW VINES , ON THE GROUND THAT VILLA BANFI DID NOT , UNDER ITALIAN LAW , BELONG TO THE CATEGORY OF PERSON ENTITLED TO SUBMIT DEVELOPMENT PLANS . UNDER THE TERMS OF COUNCIL REGULATION NO 1162/76/EEC OF MAY ON MEASURES DESIGNED TO ADJUST WINE-GROWING POTENTIAL TO MARKET REQUIREMENTS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), WHICH WAS REPLACED BY COUNCIL REGULATION NO 348/79/EEC OF FEBRUARY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), THE ONLY NEW PLANTINGS OF VINES PERMITTED ARE THOSE WHICH GIVE EFFECT TO FARM DEVELOPMENT PLANS , SUBJECT TO THE CONDITIONS LAID DOWN BY DIRECTIVE 72/. ARTICLE OF DIRECTIVE 72/INDICATES THAT A FARM IS SUITABLE FOR DEVELOPMENT WHERE , INTER ALIA , THE FARMER PRACTISES FARMING AS HIS MAIN OCCUPATION , AND ARTICLE THEREOF PROVIDES THAT MEMBER STATES ARE TO DEFINE WHAT IS MEANT BY THE EXPRESSION ' A FARMER PRACTISING FARMING AS HIS MAIN OCCUPATION '  BY REFERENCE TO A NUMBER OF CRITERIA . HOWEVER , THE ITALIAN LAW IMPLEMENTING THE DIRECTIVE INCLUDES WITHIN ITS DEFINITION OF ' A FARMER PRACTISING FARMING AS HIS MAIN OCCUPATION ' , APART FROM NATURAL PERSONS , ONLY AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVES AND FARMERS '  ASSOCIATIONS .  THE CASE CAME BEFORE THE TRIBUNALE AMMINISTRATIVO REGIONALE DELLA TOSCANA , WHICH WHEN ASKED TO DECIDE WHETHER IT WAS COMPATIBLE WITH DIRECTIVE 72/FOR A NATIONAL LAW TO RESTRICT THE BENEFITS THEREUNDER TO AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVES AND ASSOCIATIONS OF FARMERS PRACTISING FARMING AS THEIR MAIN OCCUPATION , STAYED THE PROCEEDINGS AND REQUESTED THE COURT OF JUSTICE TO GIVE A PRELIMINARY RULING ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE TERM ' FARMER PRACTISING FARMING AS HIS MAIN OCCUPATION '  FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE .  FOR A FULLER EXPOSITION OF THE NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY LAW AT ISSUE , THE FACTS OF THE CASE , THE COURSE OF THE PROCEDURE AND THE OBSERVATIONS SUBMITTED UNDER ARTICLE OF THE PROTOCOL ON THE STATUTE OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EEC , REFERENCE SHOULD BE MADE TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING . THEY ARE MENTIONED OR DISCUSSED HEREINAFTER ONLY IN SO FAR AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE REASONING OF THE COURT .  IN THE REFERENCE THE NATIONAL COURT SEEKS , IN ESSENCE , TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER ARTICLE ( ) OF DIRECTIVE 72/PERMITS MEMBER STATES , WHEN LAYING DOWN THE CRITERIA TO BE FULFILLED BY A PERSON OTHER THAN A NATURAL PERSON IN ORDER TO BE REGARDED AS A FARMER PRACTISING FARMING AS HIS MAIN OCCUPATION , TO EXCLUDE CERTAIN TYPES OF LEGAL PERSON FROM THE SCOPE OF THE DIRECTIVE SOLELY BY REASON OF THEIR LEGAL FORM .  IN ORDER TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IT SHOULD FIRST BE NOTED THAT THE DIRECTIVE IN QUESTION , WHICH ACCORDING TO ARTICLE THEREOF IS DESIGNED TO ' BRING ABOUT STRUCTURAL CONDITIONS CONDUCIVE TO A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN AGRICULTURAL INCOMES AND WORKING AND PRODUCTION CONDITIONS . . . ' , SETS UP A SYSTEM OF INCENTIVES AND AIDS FOR ' FARMS SUITABLE FOR DEVELOPMENT '  WITHOUT SPECIFYING THE LEGAL FORM WHICH SUCH A FARM SHOULD ASSUME .  THE MEANING OF ' A FARM SUITABLE FOR DEVELOPMENT '  IS SET OUT EXHAUSTIVELY IN ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE , WHICH STATES THAT THAT IS ANY FARM WHERE THE FARMER PRACTISES FARMING AS HIS MAIN OCCUPATION , POSSESSES ADEQUATE OCCUPATIONAL SKILL AND COMPETENCE , UNDERTAKES TO KEEP ACCOUNTS , AND DRAWS UP A PLAN FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BUSINESS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONDITIONS LAID DOWN BY THE DIRECTIVE . IN ADDITION , THE LEVEL OF EARNED INCOME MUST BE BELOW THE LEVEL RECEIVED FOR NON-AGRICULTURAL WORK IN THE REGION .  ARTICLE ( ) REQUIRES MEMBER STATES TO DEFINE WHAT IS MEANT BY ' A FARMER PRACTISING FARMING AS HIS MAIN OCCUPATION ' , BUT CALLS FOR THE OBSERVANCE OF CERTAIN MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS IN THE CASE OF A NATURAL PERSON . THOSE REQUIREMENTS MUST ENSURE , AT LEAST , THAT THE FARMER DERIVES NOT LESS THAN 50% OF HIS INCOME FROM FARMING AND DEVOTES TO IT MORE THAN HALF OF HIS WORKING TIME - MEMBER STATES BEING AT LIBERTY TO IMPOSE STRICTER CONDITIONS ON THOSE TWO POINTS . IT IS IN THE LIGHT OF THOSE CRITERIA IN PARTICULAR THAT MEMBER STATES ARE REQUIRED BY ARTICLE ( ) TO DEFINE THE AFORESAID TERM IN RELATION TO A PERSON OTHER THAN A NATURAL PERSON .  IN SETTING OUT THE COMMUNITY ' S DEFINITION OF ' A FARM SUITABLE FOR DEVELOPMENT ' , ARTICLES AND DELIMIT THE CLASS OF PERSON BENEFITING UNDER THE SYSTEM INTRODUCED BY THE DIRECTIVE , WITHOUT LEAVING MEMBER STATES ANY LATITUDE FOR WITHHOLDING THE BENEFITS FROM FARMS WHICH FULFIL THE CONDITIONS .  IT SHOULD THUS BE NOTED THAT THE DIRECTIVE NOT ONLY DOES NOT EXCLUDE LEGAL PERSONS BUT EXPRESSLY INCLUDES THEM WITHIN ITS SCOPE PROVIDED THAT THEY FULFIL THE CONDITIONS OF ARTICLE AND MEET THE DEFINITION OF ' A FARMER PRACTISING FARMING AS HIS MAIN OCCUPATION '  LAID DOWN IN IMPLEMENTATION OF ARTICLE ( ). SINCE THOSE CONDITIONS ARE UNRELATED TO THE FORM IN WHICH A LEGAL PERSON IS CONSTITUTED , THE INFERENCE TO BE DRAWN IS THAT MEMBER STATES ARE NOT PERMITTED TO WITHHOLD FROM LEGAL PERSONS THE BENEFIT OF PROVISIONS OF THE DIRECTIVE SOLELY BECAUSE THEY HAVE ASSUMED A SPECIFIC LEGAL FORM . DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT SUCH AS THAT WOULD , IN ANY EVENT , CONFLICT WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-DISCRIMINATION ENSHRINED IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THE EEC TREATY WHICH MEMBER STATES MUST OBSERVE WHEN GIVING EFFECT TO THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY .  CONSEQUENTLY , THE ANSWER TO BE GIVEN IS THAT ARTICLE ( ) OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 72/159/EEC MUST BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT MEMBER STATES , WHEN LAYING DOWN THE CRITERIA TO BE FULFILLED BY A PERSON OTHER THAN A NATURAL PERSON IN ORDER TO BE REGARDED AS A FARMER PRACTISING FARMING AS HIS MAIN OCCUPATION , ARE NOT PERMITTED TO EXCLUDE CERTAIN TYPES OF LEGAL PERSON FROM THE SCOPE OF THE DIRECTIVE SOLELY BY REASON OF THEIR LEGAL FORM .
