Operative part:
Article of Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of April on the rights of citizens
         of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States amending Regulation
         (EEC) No 1612/and repealing Directives 64/221/EEC, 68/360/EEC, 72/194/EEC, 73/148/EEC, 75/34/EEC, 75/35/EEC, 90/364/EEC,
         90/365/EEC and 93/96/EEC does not preclude a Member State from refusing to allow a national of a non-Member State, who is
         married to a Community national who has not exercised his right to freedom of movement, to rely on the Community rules relating
         to the mutual recognition of diplomas and to the freedom of establishment, and does not require the competent authorities
         of the Member State, from which authorisation to practise a regulated profession is sought, to take into consideration all
         the diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications, even if they were obtained outside the European Union,
         unless they have been recognised in another Member State, and the relevant experience of the person concerned, by comparing
         the specialised knowledge and abilities certified by those diplomas and that experience with the knowledge and qualifications
         required by the national rules.
