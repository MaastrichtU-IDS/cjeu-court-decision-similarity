Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE COUNCIL ' S REFUSAL TO PLACE THE APPLICANT ON THE LIST OF SUITABLE CANDIDATES ESTABLISHED AS A RESULT OF GENERAL COMPETITION NO C/HELD FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONSTITUTING A RESERVE LIST FOR THE RECRUITMENT OF GREEK-LANGUAGE TYPISTS , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JANUARY , ILIAS KYPREOS , RESIDING IN ATHENS , BROUGHT AN ACTION AGAINST THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THAT INSTITUTION ' S REFUSAL TO INCLUDE HIM IN THE LIST OF SUITABLE CANDIDATES DRAWN UP AS A RESULT OF OPEN COMPETITION COUNCIL/C/HELD FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONSTITUTING A RESERVE LIST FOR THE RECRUITMENT OF GREEK-LANGUAGE TYPISTS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , GREEK EDITION , C , JANUARY ).   IN THE NOTICE OF COMPETITION , IT WAS STATED INTER ALIA THAT CANDIDATES WERE REQUIRED ' TO POSSESS THE ABILITIES NECESSARY TO PERFORM THOSE DUTIES , AS WELL AS A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF THE GREEK LANGUAGE AND A SATISFACTORY KNOWLEDGE OF ANOTHER OFFICIAL LANGUAGE OF THE COMMUNITIES ' . IT IS NOT CONTESTED THAT MR KYPREOS INDICATED IN HIS APPLICATION THAT HE HAD A ' GOOD KNOWLEDGE '  OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN TERMS OF HIS ABILITY TO READ , WRITE AND SPEAK IT .   INITIALLY , MR KYPREOS WAS ADMITTED TO THE COMPETITION AND TOOK PART IN THE WRITTEN TESTS , WHICH TOOK PLACE IN ATHENS ON SEPTEMBER . BY LETTER OF OCTOBER , HE WAS INFORMED THAT HE HAD BEEN ADMITTED TO THE ORAL TESTS , WHICH TOOK PLACE ON NOVEMBER , ALSO IN ATHENS . IT EMERGES FROM THE COURT ' S EXAMINATION OF THE CASE THAT , WHEN THE LANGUAGE TEST WAS HELD , THE SELECTION BOARD NOTED THAT MR KYPREOS DISPLAYED A NOTABLE IGNORANCE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE , SINCE HE WAS NOT EVEN ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE QUESTIONS PUT TO HIM . CONSEQUENTLY , BY A LETTER OF DECEMBER , WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THESE PROCEEDINGS , THE SELECTION BOARD INFORMED MR KYPREOS THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE LIST OF SUITABLE CANDIDATES . THE COUNCIL ADMITS THAT , AS A RESULT OF AN OVERSIGHT , THE ADMINISTRATION OMITTED TO INFORM THE CANDIDATE IN THAT LETTER OF THE REASON FOR HIS EXCLUSION .   ON JANUARY , MR KYPREOS LODGED AN APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE SELECTION BOARD ' S DECISION , CLAIMING THAT NO REASONS WHATEVER WERE GIVEN FOR IT AND     THAT IN SUBSTANCE IT WAS UNJUSTIFIED . THE APPLICANT ALSO CONSIDERS THAT HE WAS EXCLUDED FROM THE LIST OF SUITABLE CANDIDATES FOR POLITICAL REASONS SINCE HE HAD COME TO PUBLIC NOTICE BY BEING A CANDIDATE IN PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN GREECE AND , IN , IN THE ELECTION FOR THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT .   SINCE THE APPLICATION TO THE COURT HAD THE EFFECT OF DRAWING THE COUNCIL ' S ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT NO REASONS HAD BEEN GIVEN FOR ITS DECISION , IT EXPLAINED TO THE APPLICANT , BY LETTER OF FEBRUARY , WHY HE HAD BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL AND OFFERED TO PAY HIS LAWYER ' S FEES IF HE WITHDREW HIS APPLICATION . IN HIS REPLY DATED FEBRUARY , MR KYPREOS INSISTED HOWEVER THAT HIS CASE BE RECONSIDERED BY THE SELECTION BOARD AND THAT HIS MARKS BE RE-EXAMINED . THE COUNCIL ' S DIRECTOR OF PERSONNEL THEN CONSULTED THE SELECTION BOARD FOR THE COMPETITION AGAIN . AFTER DELIBERATING THE SELECTION BOARD DECIDED UNANIMOUSLY NOT TO CHANGE THE MARKS GIVEN TO MR KYPREOS AND TO MAINTAIN ITS PREVIOUS DECISION . IN HIS LETTER OF MARCH , THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SELECTION BOARD POINTS OUT THAT THE BOARD CONSIDERED THAT IT HAD ALREADY BEEN TOO GENEROUS IN GIVING MR KYPREOS A MARK OF OUT OF FOR THE ORAL LANGUAGE TEST . BY LETTER OF MARCH , THE COUNCIL INFORMED THE APPLICANT OF THE SELECTION BOARD ' S DECISION .   AFTER RECEIVING THOSE EXPLANATIONS , MR KYPREOS CONTINUED WITH HIS ACTION , CLAIMING THAT THE LANGUAGE TEST HAD ONLY BEEN OPTIONAL , CONTENDING ONCE AGAIN THAT THE SELECTION BOARD ' S ASSESSMENT WAS NOT WELL FOUNDED AND REPEATING HIS ACCUSATION THAT THE REASON FOR HIS EXCLUSION WAS OF A POLITICAL NATURE .   SINCE THE APPLICANT DID NOT APPEAR AT THE HEARING , THE COUNCIL LIMITED ITSELF TO CONFIRMING THE ARGUMENTS AND CONCLUSIONS CONTAINED IN ITS PLEADINGS .   IT MUST IN THE FIRST PLACE BE STATED THAT THE COUNCIL IS RIGHT IN ITS CONTENTION THAT , AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLANATIONS GIVEN IN THE COURSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS , THE SUBMISSION THAT NO REASONS WERE GIVEN FOR THE DECISION IS NOW DEVOID OF PURPOSE .   WITH REGARD TO THE NATURE OF THE TESTS PROVIDED FOR IN THE NOTICE OF COMPETITION , IT MUST BE NOTED THAT , ACCORDING TO THE VERY TERMS OF SECTION IV ( B ) OF THAT NOTICE , THE ORAL LANGUAGE TEST WAS COMPULSORY AND ONLY THE WRITTEN TEST WAS OPTIONAL .       WITH REGARD TO THE APPLICANT ' S OBSERVATIONS ON THE RESULT OF HIS ORAL ENGLISH-LANGUAGE TEST , IT MUST BE OBSERVED THAT HE HAS MISUNDERSTOOD THE REQUIREMENTS OF MULTI-LINGUAL SERVICES SUCH AS THOSE OF THE COMMUNITY . THE REQUIREMENT OF A SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE OF ONE OF THE COMMUNITY ' S OFFICIAL LANGUAGES , OTHER THAN THE CANDIDATE ' S MOTHER TONGUE , CONSTITUTED A MINIMUM REQUIREMENT WHICH THE SELECTION BOARD FOR THE COMPETITION HAD TO ASSESS WITH THE RIGOUR IMPOSED BY THE NEEDS OF COMMUNICATION WITHIN THE COMMUNITY ADMINISTRATION . IT IS NOT FOR THE COURT TO REVIEW THE ASSESSMENTS WHICH WERE MADE IN COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE BY THE SELECTION BOARD ON THAT SUBJECT AND WHICH DISCLOSE A MANIFEST LACK OF LINGUISTIC ABILITY ON THE PART OF THE CANDIDATE IN QUESTION .   FINALLY , THE COMPLAINTS OF A POLITICAL CHARACTER WHICH THE APPLICANT MADE REGARDING THE SELECTION BOARD APPEAR TO BE TOTALLY WITHOUT FOUNDATION .   FOR ALL THOSE REASONS THE APPLICATION MUST BE DISMISSED .
