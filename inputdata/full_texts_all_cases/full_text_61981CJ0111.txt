Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON MAY ALPHA STEEL LTD , A COMPANY INCORPORATED UNDER ENGLISH LAW , BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE COMMISSION ' S INDIVIDUAL DECISION OF APRIL FIXING THE APPLICANT ' S PRODUCTION QUOTAS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF PURSUANT TO COMMISSION DECISION NO 2794/80/ECSC OF OCTOBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) IS VOID .       IN SUPPORT OF ITS INITAL SUBMISSION THAT DECISION NO 2794/IS UNLAWFUL , THE APPLICANT ARGUES THAT THE COMMISSION OUGHT TO HAVE CONSIDERED WHETHER IT WAS NECESSARY TO TAKE ACTION IN THE FIELD OF COMMERCIAL POLICY UNDER ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY WHEN IT WAS EXAMINING THE POSSIBILITY OF INTRODUCING A QUOTA SYSTEM . IT SUBMITS FURTHER THAT THE GENERAL DECISION IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH ARTICLE ( ) OF THE ECSC TREATY , WHICH REQUIRES THAT QUOTAS BE ESTABLISHED ' ' ON AN EQUITABLE BASIS ' ' . THE APPLICANT ALSO COMPLAINS OF THE FACT THAT THE REFERENCE PERIOD USED IN THE GENERAL DECISION RUNS FROM JULY TO JUNE AND CRITICIZES THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THAT DECISION ; IT CLAIMS THAT THOSE PROVISIONS WERE INTENDED TO BENEFIT A PARTICULAR UNDERTAKING AND THAT THEY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST NEW UNDERTAKINGS . FINALLY , THE APPLICANT TAKES EXCEPTION TO THE FACT THAT THE BENEFIT OF ARTICLE ( ) IS RESTRICTED TO UNDERTAKINGS WHICH PARTICIPATED IN A VOLUNTARY DELIVERY PROGRAMME ; THAT IS SAID TO BE IN BREACH OF THE PRINCIPLE OF NULLA POENA SINE LEGE AND THE PRINCIPLE OF THE PROTECTION OF LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION .   IN ITS SECOND SUBMISSION THE APPLICANT MAINTAINS , WITH REGARD TO THE INDIVIDUAL DECISION OF APRIL , THAT THE COMMISSION OUGHT TO HAVE ALLOWED IT RELIEF UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE GENERAL DECISION , WHICH REQUIRES THE UNDERTAKING TO HAVE PARTICIPATED FROM JULY TO JUNE IN THE COMMISSION ' S DELIVERY PROGRAMMES AND THE PROGRAMMES FOR THE UNDERTAKING TO HAVE BEEN FIXED WITH AS A BASIS . THE APPLICANT ALSO CONSIDERS THAT THE COMMISSION OUGHT TO HAVE APPLIED ARTICLE OF THE GENERAL DECISION ON THE BASIS OF PRODUCTION CAPACITY , RATHER THAN ACTUAL PRODUCTION , AND THAT IT OUGHT TO HAVE ALLOWED IT A LARGER QUOTA .   THE SUBMISSIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE THE SAME IN SUBSTANCE AS THOSE PUT FORWARD BY THE APPLICANT IN CASE 14/, WHICH CONCERNS AN APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION FIXING THE APPLICANT ' S QUOTAS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF . THE POINTS OF LAW CONSIDERED IN CASE 14/ARE IDENTICAL TO THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THESE PROCEEDINGS .   IN A JUDGMENT DELIVERED THIS DAY THE COURT HAS EXAMINED THOSE SUBMISSIONS AND REJECTED THEM AS UNFOUNDED . ON THE SAME GROUNDS THE PRESENT APPLICATION MUST ALSO BE DISMISSED .
