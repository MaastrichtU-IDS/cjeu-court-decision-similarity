Grounds
BY JUDGMENT OF NOVEMBER 1984, THE COURT ( FIFTH CHAMBER ), WHILE RESERVING THE COSTS, ALLOWED THE APPLICANTS' APPLICATIONS ( WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CASE 267/WHERE THE APPLICATION BROUGHT BY RISERIA MODENESE SRL WAS DISMISSED ) AND ORDERED THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY TO PAY THEM BY WAY OF COMPENSATION AN AMOUNT WHICH, AT THE COURT' S REQUEST, WAS TO BE ESTABLISHED WITHIN SIX MONTHS BY AGREEMENT AS BETWEEN THE PARTIES ON THE BASIS OF OBJECTIVE DATA .  THE COURT FURTHER ORDERED THAT INTEREST AT THE RATE OF 6% SHOULD BE PAID ON THE ABOVEMENTIONED AMOUNT AS FROM THE DATE OF THAT JUDGMENT, WHICH WAS ALSO TO BE THE DATE TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE CONVERSION OF THOSE AMOUNTS INTO NATIONAL CURRENCY .  BY LETTER OF APRIL THE COMMISSION INFORMED THE COURT THAT THE COMPENSATION AGREED WITH THE APPLICANTS IN CASES 256, AND 265/AND 51/HAD BEEN PAID TO THEM IN JANUARY 1986, WHICH WAS CONFIRMED, BY LETTER DATED JANUARY 1986, BY THE APPLICANT IN CASE 51/AND, BY TELEX MESSAGE OF FEBRUARY 1986, BY THE APPLICANTS IN CASES 256, AND 265/. BY TELEX MESSAGE OF SEPTEMBER THE COMMISSION NOTIFIED THE COURT THAT THE COMPENSATION AGREED WITH THE OTHER TWO APPLICANTS ( CASES 5/AND 282/) HAD ALSO BEEN PAID TO THEM, WHICH THOSE APPLICANTS CONFIRMED BY TELEX MESSAGE ON AND DECEMBER .  IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COURT OBSERVES THAT, APART FROM THE QUESTION OF COSTS, THE DISPUTE BETWEEN THE PARTIES IN THESE CASES IS SETTLED AND THERE IS THEREFORE NO NEED TO GIVE A DECISION .  AS REGARDS THE COSTS, UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS AND, UNDER ARTICLE ( ), WHERE A CASE DOES NOT PROCEED TO JUDGMENT THE COSTS ARE TO BE IN THE DISCRETION OF THE COURT .  SINCE AS A RESULT OF THE JUDGMENT OF NOVEMBER AND THE AGREEMENT REACHED BETWEEN THE PARTIES THE APPLICANTS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE APPLICANT IN CASE 267/80, RISERIA MODENESE, HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR CLAIMS, THE DEFENDANT INSTITUTIONS SHOULD BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS, AS REQUESTED BY THE APPLICANTS, EXCEPT IN CASE 267/80, WHERE RISERIA MODENESE, BEING THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY, MUST BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .
