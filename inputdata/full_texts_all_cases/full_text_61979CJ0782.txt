Summary
A DECISION BY AN INSTITUTION MAKING GENERAL IMPLEMENTING PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE PROCEDURE FOR PROMOTION WITHIN A CAREER BRACKET DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN IMPLEMENTING PROVISION PRESCRIBED BY THE STAFF REGULATIONS BUT AN INTERNAL MEASURE , INTRODUCED BY THE INSTITUTION OF ITS OWN ACCORD , WHICH CANNOT THEREFORE BE REGARDED AS HAVING THE CHARACTER OF STRICT LAW . THE FACT THAT THE INSTITUTION HAS DEPARTED FROM THE PROCEDURE PROVIDED FOR BY THAT DECISION IN ORDER TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF AN EXCEPTIONAL SITUATION CANNOT THEREFORE BE REGARDED AS ' ' AN INFRINGEMENT OF AN ESSENTIAL PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENT ' '  OF SUCH A NATURE AS TO JUSTIFY THE ANNULMENT OF PROMOTION DECISIONS MADE IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES .

Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISIONS PROMOTING OFFICIALS FROM GRADE L/A TO GRADE L/A FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR AND OF THE DECISION REJECTING THE COMPLAINT LODGED AGAINST THOSE DECISIONS , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON OCTOBER THE APPLICANT , MR GEERAERD , AN OFFICIAL ON THE COMMISSION ' S LANGUAGE STAFF BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISIONS TO PROMOTE OFFICIALS FROM GRADE L/A TO GRADE L/A MADE IN RESPECT OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR AND FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE IMPLIED DECISION REJECTING HIS COMPLAINT AGAINST THOSE DECISIONS .   AT THE TIME OF THE EVENTS GIVING RISE TO THE DISPUTE THE APPLICANT WAS IN A POST IN GRADE L/A IN THE FORMER L/A - L/A CAREER BRACKET . ON MAY THE COUNCIL ADOPTED REGULATION NO 912/AMENDING THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ) WHICH CAME INTO FORCE ON MAY ; THE EFFECT OF ARTICLE OF THE REGULATION WAS TO REARRANGE THE CAREER BRACKETS FOR LANGUAGE STAFF IN SO FAR AS THE L/A - L/A CAREER BRACKET ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' ' THE FORMER CAREER BRACKET ' ' ) WAS ABOLISHED TO FORM NEW CAREER BRACKETS WHICH ARE L/A - L/A AND L/A - L/A . PROMOTION FROM GRADE L/A TO GRADE L/A , WHICH PREVIOUSLY WAS PROMOTION WITHIN THE SAME CAREER BRACKET , THUS BECAME PROMOTION FROM ONE CAREER BRACKET TO ANOTHER .   THE PROBLEMS OF ADJUSTMENT RESULTING FROM THAT REARRANGEMENT WERE CONSIDERED BY THE HEADS OF ADMINISTRATION OF THE VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS AT THEIR 116TH MEETING HELD ON OCTOBER . WHERE THE FORMER CAREER BRACKETS WERE CONCERNED THE HEADS OF ADMINISTRATION THOUGHT THAT OFFICIALS COULD STILL BE PROMOTED , IN THE THEN CURRENT BUDGET YEAR AND WITH EFFECT FROM JANUARY , UNDER THE RULES APPLICABLE BEFORE THE NEW REGULATION CAME INTO FORCE IF     ON THE AFORESAID DATE OFFICIALS HAD THE SENIORITY REQUIRED , WHILST THE PROMOTION OF OFFICIALS TO THE NEW CAREER BRACKET WOULD BE CARRIED OUT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE NEW RULES . THE HEADS OF ADMINISTRATION RECOMMENDED THAT THOSE RULES BE APPLIED IN THE SAME WAY IN ALL THE INSTITUTIONS .   THE COMMISSION IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE NECESSARY STEPS TO PUT THAT RECOMMENDATION INTO EFFECT , BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR IN QUESTION . IN THE CASE OF OFFICIALS ON THE LANGUAGE STAFF ELIGIBLE FOR PROMOTION FROM GRADE L/A TO GRADE L/A IN THE ' ' FORMER CAREER BRACKET ' '  THE COMMISSION FORMED AN ' ' AD HOC COMMITTEE ' '  COMPOSED IN THE SAME WAY AS THE PROMOTION COMMITTEE FOR THE LANGUAGE STAFF . BY A MEMORANDUM OF DECEMBER THE DIRECTOR OF THE TRANSLATION , DOCUMENTATION , REPRODUCTION AND LIBRARY DIRECTORATE , IX/D , SUBMITTED TO THAT GROUP A LIST TOGETHER WITH A PROPOSAL TO PROMOTE OFFICIALS SELECTED FROM CANDIDATES FULFILLING THE NECESSARY REQUIREMENTS . THE AD HOC COMMITTEE UNANIMOUSLY AGREED TO RECOMMEND THE PROMOTION OF THE OFFICIALS PROPOSED .   THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY ACCEPTED THAT PROPOSAL AND THE OFFICIALS CONCERNED WERE CONSEQUENTLY PROMOTED WITH EFFECT FROM JANUARY . THAT DECISION WAS PUBLISHED IN ADMINISTRATIVE NOTICES NO OF THE COMMISSION OF FEBRUARY .    ON MARCH THE APPLICANT LODGED A COMPLAINT WITH THE COMMISSION AGAINST THOSE DECISIONS PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS . ON AUGUST THE COMMISSION INFORMED THE APPLICANT THAT IT WAS UNABLE TO GIVE HIM A FAVOURABLE REPLY . IT IS AGAINST BOTH THOSE DECISIONS TO REJECT HIS COMPLAINT , THE FIRST IMPLIED AND THE SECOND EXPRESS , THAT THE APPLICANT HAS MADE HIS APPLICATION WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD .   IN SUPPORT OF THAT APPLICATION THE APPLICANT MAKES TWO SUBMISSIONS . THE FIRST , PRESENTED AS THE MAIN ARGUMENT , IS PRIMARILY BASED ON THE RULES CONCERNING THE APPLICATION OF REGULATION NO 912/; THE SECOND , PRESENTED IN THE ALTERNATIVE , IS BASED ON THE FAILURE BY THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY TO OBSERVE THE FORMALITIES PROVIDED FOR IN THE COMMISSION DECISION OF DECEMBER , AS     AMENDED BY A DECISION OF JULY , ON GENERAL IMPLEMENTING PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE PROCEDURE TO PROMOTE OFFICIALS WITHIN A CAREER BRACKET , PUBLISHED IN ADMINISTRATIVE NOTICES NO OF MAY ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' ' THE DECISION OF DECEMBER ' ' ).  THE FIRST SUBMISSION   THE APPLICANT CONTENDS AS HIS MAIN ARGUMENT THAT AS A RESULT OF THE RESTRUCTURING OF CAREER BRACKETS BY REGULATION NO 912/PROMOTION FROM GRADE L/A TO GRADE L/A IS NOW PROMOTION FROM ONE CAREER BRACKET TO ANOTHER AND AS SUCH REQUIRES THE PUBLICATION OF A VACANCY NOTICE BY VIRTUE OF ARTICLES AND ( ) AND ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS . BY TREATING THE PROMOTIONS IN POINT AS STILL BEING PROMOTIONS WITHIN THE SAME CAREER BRACKET THE COMMISSION DISREGARDED THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE REGULATION HAD IMMEDIATE APPLICATION FROM ITS ENTRY INTO FORCE .   THE COMMISSION VIEWS THAT SUBMISSION AS INADMISSIBLE FOR LACK OF INTEREST ON THE PART OF THE APPLICANT WHO WAS IN ANY EVENT ONE OF THOSE OFFICIALS ELIGIBLE FOR PROMOTION FROM GRADE L/A TO GRADE L/A SO THAT PUBLICATION OF A FORMAL VACANCY NOTICE COULD NOT HAVE IMPROVED HIS SITUATION . BESIDES , THE COMMISSION BELIEVES THAT IT WAS ENTITLED TO TREAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OLD RULES THE SITUATION OF OFFICIALS WHO FULFILLED ALL THE NECESSARY REQUIREMENTS TO BE PROMOTED WITHIN THEIR FORMER CAREER BRACKET AT THE TIME REGULATION NO 912/CAME INTO FORCE .   THE APPLICANT ' S SUBMISSION MUST BE REJECTED . THERE IS NO NEED TO GO INTO THE INTEREST OF THE APPLICANT , AS IT SUFFICES TO STATE THAT IN ANY EVENT THE MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION IN ORDER TO REGULATE THE SITUATION OF OFFICIALS WHO MIGHT EXPECT TO BE PROMOTED WITHIN THEIR FORMER CAREER BRACKET AT THE TIME WHEN THE NEW REGULATION CAME INTO FORCE COME UNDER THE MEASURES WHICH MAY BE LEGITIMATELY TAKEN TO RESOLVE THE TRANSITIONAL PROBLEMS ARISING IN REGARD TO THE OFFICIALS CONCERNED FROM THE RESTRUCTURING OF CAREER BRACKETS . IT FOLLOWS THAT THE PROMOTIONS IN QUESTION COULD STILL BE TREATED AS BEING PROMOTIONS WITHIN THE SAME CAREER BRACKET .      THE ALTERNATIVE SUBMISSION   AS AN ALTERNATIVE ARGUMENT THE APPLICANT CONTENDS THAT THE COMMISSION DID NOT OBSERVE THE FORMALITIES PROVIDED FOR BY THE DECISION OF DECEMBER UNDER WHICH THE PROMOTION OF ANY OFFICIAL MUST BE PRECEDED BY THE PUBLICATION OF THE LIST OF OFFICIALS REGARDED AS THE MOST DESERVING OF PROMOTION , DRAWN UP BY THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY ON THE PROPOSAL OF PROMOTION COMMITTEES . FURTHERMORE , CONTRARY TO PRACTICE , THE PROMOTION PROPOSALS OF THE BRANCHES WERE NOT NOTIFIED TO THE STAFF . THOSE ARE , IT IS ALLEGED , ESSENTIAL FORMALITIES SINCE THE PURPOSE OF THE PUBLICATION OF THOSE LISTS IS TO ENABLE THE OFFICIALS CONCERNED TO DEFEND THEIR INTERESTS EFFECTIVELY . FINALLY , THE APPLICANT CONTENDS THAT THERE IS A FURTHER IRREGULARITY IN REGARD TO THE PROMOTION PROPOSALS IN SO FAR AS THEY ORIGINATED NOT FROM THE PROMOTION COMMITTEE SO-CALLED BUT FROM AN ' ' AD HOC COMMITTEE ' '  SEPARATE FROM IT .   THE COMMISSION CONTENDS IN THIS REGARD THAT THE DRAWING UP AND THE PUBLICATION OF THE LIST OF OFFICIALS JUDGED TO BE THE MOST DESERVING OF PROMOTION AS WELL AS THE PUBLICATION OF PROPOSALS PUT FORWARD FOR THAT PURPOSE BY THEIR BRANCHES DO NOT CONSTITUTE ESSENTIAL FORMALITIES WHICH , IF NOT CARRIED OUT , PROVIDE SUFFICIENT GROUND FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE PROMOTION DECISIONS IN QUESTION . AS IT WAS , THE PROMOTION PROPOSALS WERE MADE BY THE OFFICIALS '  SUPERIOR OFFICERS , WITH ALL DUE CARE , SO THAT THE CASE OF EACH OFFICIAL ELIGIBLE FOR PROMOTION WAS DULY CONSIDERED AND THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY HAD AT ITS DISPOSAL ALL THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO TAKE AN INFORMED DECISION .   THE SUBSIDIARY SUBMISSION MUST ALSO BE DISMISSED . IN FACT THE DECISION OF DECEMBER WHICH THE APPLICANT CLAIMS WAS NOT OBSERVED DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN IMPLEMENTING PROVISION PRESCRIBED BY THE STAFF REGULATIONS BUT AN INTERNAL MEASURE , INTRODUCED BY THE COMMISSION OF ITS OWN ACCORD , WHICH CANNOT THEREFORE BE REGARDED AS HAVING THE CHARACTER OF STRICT LAW . UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES CAN THE FACT THAT THE COMMISSION DEPARTED FROM THE PROCEDURE PROVIDED FOR BY THAT DECISION IN ORDER TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE EXCEPTIONAL SITUATION WHICH AROSE AS A RESULT OF THE REORGANIZATION OF THE CAREER BRACKETS FOR LANGUAGE STAFF BE REGARDED AS ' ' AN INFRINGEMENT OF AN ESSENTIAL PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENT ' '  WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY . THOSE CONSIDERATIONS APPLY ESPECIALLY TO MERE ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES WHICH ,     ACCORDING TO THE APPLICANT , THE COMMISSION ORDINARILY OBSERVED WHEN PROMOTING OFFICIALS .   CONSIDERATION OF THE FACTS HAS MOREOVER DISCLOSED THAT NO SAFEGUARD CONTAINED IN THE STAFF REGULATIONS HAS BEEN DISREGARDED IN THE PROCEDURE APPLIED TO THE PROMOTIONS IN ISSUE . IT IS NOT IN FACT DISPUTED THAT THE APPLICANT ' S CASE RECEIVED ATTENTIVE AND IMPARTIAL TREATMENT FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY AS DID THOSE OF OTHER OFFICIALS WHO LIKEWISE FULFILLED THE REQUIREMENTS FOR BEING PROMOTED . THE APPLICANT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO PROVE THAT HE INCURRED ANY SPECIAL DISADVANTAGE AS A RESULT OF THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY ' S FOLLOWING , AS IT DID , A PROCEDURE DIFFERENT FROM THAT PRESCRIBED BY THE DECISION OF DECEMBER . CONSEQUENTLY THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT AS TO THE LAWFUL NATURE OF THE PROMOTIONS MADE UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES .   IT FOLLOWS FROM ALL OF THE FOREGOING THAT THE APPLICATION MUST BE REJECTED AS A WHOLE .  
Decision on costs
UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY SHALL BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .   HOWEVER , UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE INSTITUTIONS IN ACTIONS BY EMPLOYEES OF THE COMMUNITIES SHALL BE BORNE BY THOSE INSTITUTIONS .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ( SECOND CHAMBER )   HEREBY :   . DISMISSES THE APPLICATION ;      . ORDERS THE PARTIES TO BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .
