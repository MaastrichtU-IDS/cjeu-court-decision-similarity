                     of the undertakings capable of guaranteeing the provision of universal service, the French Republic failed to fulfil its obligations
                     under Articles 8(2), and of and Annex IV to Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of March on universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (‘Universal
                     Service Directive’);
