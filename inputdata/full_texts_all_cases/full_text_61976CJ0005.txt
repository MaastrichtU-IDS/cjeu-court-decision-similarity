Subject of the case
APPLICATION , AT THE PRESENT STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS , REGARDING THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION LODGED BY THE APPLICANT FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE ' PROCEDURES TO BE IMPLEMENTED PRIOR TO DECISIONS ON THE TRANSFER FROM CATEGORY B TO CATEGORY A OF OFFICIALS IN THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL SERVICES ' , OF THE DECISIONS TAKEN IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE PROCEDURES , AND , SO FAR AS NECESSARY , OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS , 
Grounds
THE APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JANUARY SEEKS IN PARTICULAR THE ANNULMENT OF A DECISION OF THE COMMISSION OF OCTOBER REJECTING A COMPLAINT BROUGHT BY THE APPLICANT ON MARCH AND DIRECTED AGAINST THE ' PROCEDURES TO BE IMPLEMENTED PRIOR TO DECISIONS ON THE TRANSFER FROM CATEGORY B TO CATEGORY A OF OFFICIALS IN THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL SERVICES '  PUBLISHED IN THE STAFF COURIER ON DECEMBER .  BY AN APPLICATION ON A PROCEDURAL ISSUE LODGED ON FEBRUARY THE DEFENDANT RAISED UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE A PRELIMINARY OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY ON THE GROUNDS OF THE ALLEGED LATENESS OF THE APPLICATION .   IN SUPPORT OF THIS PRELIMINARY OBJECTION THE DEFENDANT STATES IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT THE APPLICANT ' S COMPLAINT REGISTERED ON MARCH WAS REJECTED BY THE REFUSAL IMPLIED BY THE ABSENCE OF A REPLY WITHIN THE FOUR MONTHS PRESCRIBED IN THE LAST SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , THAT IS IN THE PRESENT CASE BEFORE JULY , AND THIS IMPLIED DECISION OF REFUSAL SHOULD THEREFORE HAVE BEEN CONTESTED BY AN APPLICATION TO THE COURT BEFORE OCTOBER UND THE SECOND INDENT OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   IT STATES THAT SINCE THE EXPRESS DECISION OF THE COMMISSION WAS NOT NOTIFIED TO THE APPLICANT UNTIL OCTOBER , THAT IS AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE PERIOD FOR BRINGING AN APPEAL , IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR IT TO HAVE ACTIVATED THE LAST SENTENCE OF THAT PROVISION , WHICH PROVIDES THAT ' WHERE A COMPLAINT IS REJECTED BY EXPRESS DECISION AFTER BEING REJECTED BY IMPLIED DECISION BUT BEFORE THE PERIOD FOR LODGING AN APPEAL HAS EXPIRED , THE PERIOD FOR LODGING THE APPEAL SHALL START TO RUN AFRESH ' .   HOWEVER A DECISION MUST BE REGARDED AS ARISING WITHIN THE MEANING OF THIS PROVISION AT THE DATE ON WHICH IT IS ADOPTED BY THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY .   THE LATTER , HAVING ADOPTED AN EXPRESS DECISION WITHIN THE PERIOD FOR BRINGING AN APPEAL , MUST EXCEPT A NEW PERIOD TO BEGIN TO RUN IN FAVOUR OF THE PERSON CONCERNED WITHOUT ANY DELAY IN NOTIFICATION BEING TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT .   IT IS PROPER THEREFORE TO CONCLUDE THAT IN THE PRESENT CASE THE EXPRESS DECISION OF THE COMMISSION OF OCTOBER CAUSED A NEW PERIOD FOR BRINGING AN APPEAL TO BEGIN TO RUN .   THE PROBLEM THEN ARISES AS TO THE DATE FROM WHICH THIS PERIOD MUST BE CALCULATED .   IN THIS RESPECT THE DATE OF NOTIFICATION IS THE CRITERION IN ALL CASES WHERE AS IN THE PRESENT CASE THE DELAY IN NOTIFICATION IS NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PERSON CONCERNED .   ONLY THE NOTIFICATION ENABLES HIM TO HAVE EFFECTIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE DECISION AND THE GROUNDS BY WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION JUSTIFIES IT .   SINCE NOTIFICATION TOOK EFFECT IN THE PRESENT CASE ON OCTOBER THE APPLICATION LODGED ON JANUARY WAS BROUGHT WITHIN THE THREE MONTHS LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   ACCORDINGLY THE PRELIMINARY OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY MUST BE REJECTED .
