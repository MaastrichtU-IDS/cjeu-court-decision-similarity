Operative part
The Court:
1.
	Declares that, 
–        by making the import, keeping and sale of specimens of birds born and bred in captivity legally placed on the market in other
         Member States subject to restrictive conditions that require the market participants concerned to alter the marking of the
         birds so as to satisfy the conditions specifically required by the Belgium legislation, and by failing to recognise the marking
         accepted in other Member States or certificates issued in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 338/of December
         on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein; and
      
–        by denying traders the opportunity to obtain exemptions from the prohibition of keeping indigenous European birds legally
         placed on the market in other Member States, 
      
the Kingdom of Belgium has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article EC
2.
	Orders the Kingdom of Belgium to pay the costs.
