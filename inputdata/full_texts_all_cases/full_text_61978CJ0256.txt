Subject of the case
APPLICATION PRIMARILY FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE IMPLIED DECISION REJECTING AN APPLICATION MADE ON JUNE UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS , AGAINST THE DECISION OF THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE ISPRA CENTRE DATED MARCH , REFUSING TO GRANT A REQUEST MADE ON MARCH CONCERNING THE APPLICATION OF UP-TO-DATE EXCHANGE RATES FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT IN ITALIAN LIRE OF SICKNESS EXPENSES PAID IN GERMAN MARKS , WHICH WERE INCLUDED IN A STATEMENT DATED DECEMBER OF THE OFFICE AT ISPRA RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTLING CLAIMS , 
Grounds
THE APPLICATION MADE ON NOVEMBER SEEKS PRIMARILY THE ANNULMENT OF THE IMPLIED DECISION REJECTING A COMPLAINT MADE ON JUNE UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AGAINST THE DECISION OF THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE ISPRA CENTRE DATED MARCH REFUSING TO GRANT A REQUEST MADE ON MARCH CONCERNING THE APPLICATION OF UP-TO-DATE EXCHANGE RATES FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT IN ITALIAN LIRE OF SICKNESS EXPENSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT IN GERMAN MARKS , WHICH WERE THE SUBJECT OF A STATEMENT DATED DECEMBER OF THE OFFICE AT ISPRA RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTLING CLAIMS .   BETWEEN NOVEMBER AND AUGUST THE APPLICANT , A GERMAN NATIONAL AND AN OFFICIAL AT THE ISPRA JOINT RESEARCH CENTRE , AND HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN RECEIVED HEALTH CARE IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY , THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN . THE COST OF TREATMENT CAME TO A TOTAL OF DM 317.AND WAS PAID FOR BY THE APPLICANT IN THAT CURRENCY . REIMBURSEMENT OF THESE EXPENSES WAS MADE IN ITALIAN LIRE ON JANUARY ON THE BASIS OF A STATEMENT PREPARED ON DECEMBER BY THE OFFICE AT ISPRA RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTLING CLAIMS .   ON MARCH THE APPLICANT MADE A REQUEST UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS CONCERNING A LOSS OF DM 326.WHICH HE HAD SUFFERED UPON REIMBURSEMENT OF HIS HEALTH EXPENSES OWING TO THE APPLICATION OF THE SYSTEM OF EXCHANGE RATES BROUGHT UP TO DATE .       THIS SYSTEM , WHICH REPLACES THE SYSTEM OF FIXED EXCHANGE RATES , WHICH , FOR WEIGHTINGS , TOOK ACCOUNT OF THE PAR VALUES USED ON JANUARY FOR THE CONVERSION OF BELGIAN FRANCS INTO THE CURRENCY OF THE COUNTRY OF EMPLOYMENT , WAS ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION ON NOVEMBER . IT WAS DECIDED , AS PART OF THE SOLUTION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS , THAT AS REGARDS THE REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES , PARTICULARLY SICKNESS EXPENSES UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , THE ACCOUNTING OFFICER OF THE COMMISSION WOULD BE GIVEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ISSUING IN THE MIDDLE OF EACH QUARTER THE RATES TO BE USED FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE FOLLOWING QUARTER .   BY A CIRCULAR OF MARCH THE CENTRAL OFFICE OF THE JOINT SCHEME LAID DOWN IMPLEMENTING PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE BRINGING UP TO DATE OF EXCHANGE RATES IN THE FIELD OF SICKNESS INSURANCE BY WHICH :   - ' ' WHERE TREATMENT IS PAID FOR IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN BELGIAN FRANCS THE SUMS PAID ARE TO BE CONVERTED INTO BELGIAN FRANCS AT THE UP-TO-DATE RATE IN FORCE AT THE DATE WHEN THE TREATMENT WAS PROVIDED ;  - IF PAYMENT IS MADE IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN BELGIAN FRANCS THE AMOUNT IN BELGIAN FRANCS FOR EACH TREATMENT IS TO BE RECONVERTED INTO THE CURRENCY IN WHICH PAYMENT WAS MADE AT THE UP-TO-DATE RATE IN FORCE AT THE DATE WHEN TREATMENT WAS PROVIDED ' ' .   ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS PROVIDES THAT : ' ' AN OFFICIAL , HIS SPOUSE , HIS CHILDREN AND OTHER DEPENDANTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF ANNEX VII ARE INSURED AGAINST SICKNESS UP TO 80% OF THE EXPENDITURE INCURRED SUBJECT TO RULES DRAWN UP BY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE COMMUNITIES AFTER CONSULTING THE STAFF REGULATIONS COMMITTEE . . . ' '   UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF ANNEX VII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS , ' ' PAYMENT SHALL BE MADE TO EACH OFFICIAL AT THE PLACE AND IN THE CURRENCY OF THE COUNTRY WHERE HE CARRIES OUT HIS DUTIES ' ' .   ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES ON SICKNESS INSURANCE FOR OFFICIALS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ADOPTED , AS REGARDS THE COMMISSION , ON SEPTEMBER PROVIDES THAT ' ' PERSONS COVERED . . . SHALL BE FREE TO CHOOSE THEIR PRACTITIONERS AND HOSPITALS OR CLINICS ' ' . UNDER ARTICLE OF THOSE RULES THE LATEST DATE BY WHICH AN APPLICATION FOR REIMBURSEMENT MUST BE MADE IS ' ' DURING THE CALENDAR YEAR FOLLOWING THAT IN WHICH TREATMENT WAS ADMINISTERED . ' '   THE APPLICANT BASES HIS APPLICATION ON THE RIGHT GIVEN TO OFFICIALS BY THE STAFF REGULATIONS TO BE REIMBURSED A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF ACTUAL SICKNESS EXPENSES INCURRED , AND ON THE EFFECT WHICH THE SYSTEM OF EXCHANGE RATES BROUGHT UP TO DATE HAS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY OF TREATMENT OF OFFICIALS ACCORDING TO WHETHER THEY RESIDE IN A COUNTRY WITH A STRONG CURRENCY OR A COUNTRY WITH A WEAK CURRENCY IN RELATION TO THE ONE WHERE THE COMMUNITY HAS ITS SEAT AND THE COUNTRY WHERE THEY ARE EMPLOYED .   THE COMMISSION DEFENDS THE CHOICE OF THE DAY WHEN TREATMENT WAS GIVEN AS THE ONLY DATE RELEVANT FOR THE CALCULATION OF THE REFUND , ARGUING THAT EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES DEPEND ON THE FREE WORLD MARKET OVER WHICH IT HAS NO INFLUENCE AND THAT THE INTERVAL , AT TIMES RATHER LENGTHY , BETWEEN THE PROVISION OF TREATMENT AND THE SUBMISSION OF THE CLAIM FOR REIMBURSEMENT TO THE OFFICE RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTLING CLAIMS IS LARGELY IN THE HANDS OF THE CLAIMANT .   THE DIFFICULTIES OF ADMINISTERING , IN A PERIOD OF FLOATING EXCHANGE RATES , A SYSTEM SUCH AS THAT FOR REFUNDING SICKNESS EXPENSES INCURRED IN MANY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES MAY JUSTIFY THE APPLICATION OF A SINGLE EXCHANGE RATE DURING A WHOLE QUARTER ; BUT THE DELAY WHICH MAY OCCUR BETWEEN THE DAY ON WHICH TREATMENT IS PAID FOR AND THE DAY ON WHICH REIMBURSEMENT IS EFFECTED IS LIKELY TO CREATE INEQUALITY BETWEEN OFFICIALS ACCORDING TO WHETHER THEY PERFORM THEIR DUTIES IN A COUNTRY WITH A WEAK CURRENCY OR IN ONE WITH A STRONG CURRENCY . THE EXISTENCE OF A TIME-LIMIT WITHIN WHICH CLAIMS FOR REIMBURSEMENT MUST BE MADE IS ENOUGH TO AVOID SPECULATIVE DELAYS WITHOUT THEREBY IMPAIRING THE RIGHT OF THE CLAIMANT TO RECEIVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF ACTUAL REIMBURSEMENT IRRESPECTIVE OF THE COUNTRY TO WHICH HE IS POSTED .       IN THE LIGHT OF THESE CONSIDERATIONS THE COURT HOLDS THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL TREATMENT OF OFFICIALS REQUIRES THAT THE RATE OF EXCHANGE TO BE APPLIED IN THE REIMBURSEMENT OF SICKNESS EXPENSES SHOULD BE AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THE RATE ON THE DATE OF REIMBURSEMENT . THE RATE TO BE APPLIED MUST THEREFORE BE THAT FOR THE QUARTER IN WHICH THE REIMBURSEMENT IS EFFECTED .  
Decision on costs

ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ( FIRST CHAMBER )   HEREBY :   . ORDERS THE COMMISSION TO REIMBURSE TO THE APPLICANT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF THE SICKNESS EXPENSES CALCULATED AT THE RATE FOR THE DAY ON WHICH TREATMENT WAS RECEIVED AND THE RATE FOR THE QUARTER IN WHICH REIMBURSEMENT WAS EFFECTED ;  . ORDERS THE DEFENDANT TO PAY THE COSTS .
