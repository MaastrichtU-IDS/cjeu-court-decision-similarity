Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE BENEFIT OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS TO BE GRANTED TO THE APPLICANT, 
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JUNE THE APPLICANT HAS BROUGHT AN ACTION SEEKING THE ANNULMENT OF THE IMPLIED REJECTION BY THE COMMISSION OF HIS COMPLAINT OF FEBRUARY WHEREBY HE SOUGHT TO BE GRANTED THE BENEFIT OF ARTICLE ( ) ( C ) AND ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS .  THE APPLICANT ALLEGES THAT THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE CONVENED IN PURSUANT TO THE THIRD SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS ADMITTED THAT HE WAS SUFFERING PARTIAL PERMANENT INVALIDITY, THE DEGREE OF WHICH REMAINED TO BE DETERMINED .  THEREFORE HE ASKED THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE THAT DEGREE IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT BENEFIT UNDER ARTICLE ( ) ( C ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH PARAGRAPH ( ) OF THAT ARTICLE TO REIMBURSE TO HIM ALL THE MEDICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL EXPENSES INCURRED BECAUSE OF THIS INVALIDITY .  IN THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY SET UP A NEW INVALIDITY COMMITTEE TO WHICH IT ASSIGNED THE DUTY NOT ONLY OF RULING AS TO THE EXISTENCE OF TOTAL PERMANENT INVALIDITY BUT ALSO EXAMINING WHETHER THE APPLICANT MIGHT BE SUFFERING FROM PARTIAL PERMANENT INVALIDITY CAUSED BY THE WORKING CONDITIONS AND, IF THIS WAS SO, TO DETERMINE THE DEGREE OF INVALIDITY .  THIS COMMITTEE WAS FURTHER GIVEN THE TASK OF EXAMINING WHETHER THE MEDICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL EXPENSES FOR WHICH REIMBURSEMENT WAS SOUGHT SHOULD BE REGARDED AS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE .  THE APPLICANT REFUSED TO APPEAR BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE OR TO ALLOW HIS MEDICAL FILE TO BE SENT TO IT BY THE DEPARTMENTS OF HIS INSTITUTION .  IN SUPPORT OF THIS REFUSAL HE RAISED THE ALLEGEDLY AMBIGUOUS NATURE OF THE DUTY ASSIGNED TO THE COMMISSION AND SOUGHT " ACTUAL ADMISSION OF THE EXISTENCE OF AN OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE ON THE BASIS OF THE REPORT OF THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE OF DECEMBER ".  THE EXISTENCE OF AN OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE CAUSING TOTAL OR PARTIAL PERMANENT INVALIDITY OF THE OFFICIAL AND GIVING HIM THE RIGHT TO BENEFIT UNDER ARTICLE OR ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AS THE CASE MAY BE MUST APPEAR CLEARLY AND PRECISELY FROM THE RELEVANT CONCLUSIONS OF THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE OF ANNEX VIII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  IN THIS CASE THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE CONVENED IN STATED IN ITS REPORT THAT THE APPLICANT SUFFERED FROM ASTHMATIC OR RELATED BRONCHITIS CAUSED LARGELY BY THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH HE HAD WORKED IN THE OFFSET WORKROOM OF THE PUBLICATIONS OFFICE .  AT THE SAME TIME IT FOUND THAT THERE WAS AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE ASTHMATIC CONDITION WHICH HAD BEEN FOUND BY SEVERAL DOCTORS PREVIOUSLY, CAUSED IN ALL PROBABILITY BY THE FACT THAT SINCE FEBRUARY THE APPLICANT HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED TO A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT .  IT CONCLUDED THAT " THE STATE OF HEALTH OF MR VELLOZZI DOES NOT PREVENT HIM FROM WORKING BUT URGENTLY REQUIRES THAT THE WORK SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT IN A PLACE SHELTERED FROM THE ELEMENTS AND IN AN ATMOSPHERE FREE FROM ANY SUBSTANCE WHICH MIGHT IRRITATE THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS ".  THUS WHILST THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE SET UP IN ADMITTED THAT THE APPLICANT WAS SUFFERING FROM A FORM OF BRONCHITIS IT NEVERTHELESS DID NOT CONCLUDE THAT HE WAS SUFFERING FROM AN OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE ENTAILING PARTIAL PERMANENT INVALIDITY .  THE FORCE OF THE CONCLUSIONS WHICH IT REACHED AS TO THE EXISTENCE OF THE APPLICANT' S PARTIAL PERMANENT INVALIDITY ARE WEAKENED BY THE FACT THAT ACCORDING TO THE REPORT OF DECEMBER MR VELLOZZI' S LACK OF COOPERATION PREVENTED THE COMMISSION FROM UNDERTAKING ALL THE MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS WHICH IT CONTEMPLATED .  IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE APPLICANT CANNOT RELY ON SUCH A REPORT TO ARGUE THAT THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE SET UP IN ADMITTED THAT HE WAS SUFFERING PARTIAL PERMANENT INVALIDITY OR THAT THE NEW INVALIDITY COMMITTEE SHOULD MERELY DETERMINE THE DEGREE OF THIS INVALIDITY AND THE MEDICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL EXPENSES TO BE REIMBURSED UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  ON THE CONTRARY THE REPORT OF DECEMBER JUSTIFIES THE SETTING UP OF A NEW INVALIDITY COMMITTEE WITH THE DUTY INTER ALIA OF DECIDING THE CAUSES OF THE APPLICANT' S ALLEGED INVALIDITY .  FOR THESE REASONS THE APPLICATION IS REJECTED .
