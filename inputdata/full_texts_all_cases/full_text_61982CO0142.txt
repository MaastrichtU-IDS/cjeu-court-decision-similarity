Grounds
ACCORDING TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COURT , AN ORDER SUSPENDING OPERATION OF A DECISION OR PROVIDING FOR OTHER INTERIM MEASURES IS TO BE SUBJECT TO THE EXISTENCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO URGENCY AND GROUNDS ESTABLISHING A PRIMA FACIE CASE FOR THE GRANT OF SUCH MEASURES .   ACCORDING TO THE WELL-ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW OF THE COURT , MEASURES OF THAT KIND MAY BE ORDERED IN INTERLOCUTORY PROCEEDINGS IF THEIR GRANT IS PRIMA FACIE JUSTIFIED ON FACTUAL AND LEGAL GROUNDS AND IF THEY ARE URGENT , AS BEING NECESSARY TO AVOID SERIOUS AND IRREPARABLE DAMAGE TO THE INTERESTS OF THE PERSON CONCERNED .   IT IS NECESSARY TO EXAMINE WHETHER THOSE CONDITIONS ARE MET IN THIS CASE .   IN RELATION TO THE ' ' FUMUS BONI JURIS ' ' , IT CANNOT BE CONSIDERED THAT THE APPLICATION MEETS THAT CONDITION . INDEED IT APPEARS FROM THE FILE :    ( A ) THAT BETWEEN DECEMBER ( WHEN MR COPINE OBTAINED A DEGREE IN COMMERCIAL SCIENCE ) AND SEPTEMBER , THE APPLICANT CARRIED OUT THE FOLLOWING TASKS IN THE TECHNICAL-ADMINISTRATIVE SECTION OF THE SPECIALIZED DEPARTMENT FOR ADMINISTRATIVE AND TECHNICAL SERVICES :    ' ' ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OF PRINTING CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO WITH OUTSIDE UNDERTAKINGS FOR THE PUBLISHING OF MATERIAL FROM ALL THE INSTITUTIONS . PARTICULAR DUTIES :   KEEPING UP TO DATE INDEX OF :    NATIONAL WAGES , AND   PRICES OF MATERIALS ( PAPER );  UPDATING OF CONTRACT PRICES ;  DRAFTING OF REPORTS TO THE PURCHASES AND CONTRACTS ADVISORY COMMITTEE ;  ENTERING ITS COMMITMENTS OF EXPENDITURE ' ' ;      ( B)THAT BETWEEN SEPTEMBER AND NOVEMBER ( THE CLOSING DATE FOR THE SUBMISSION OF APPLICATIONS TO OPEN COMPETITION NO COM/A/), THE APPLICANT WAS ENTRUSTED IN THE NEW DEVELOPMENTS SECTION OF THE SPECIALIZED DEPARTMENT FOR ADMINISTRATIVE AND TECHNICAL SERVICES WITH CARRYING OUT ' ' CERTAIN STUDIES ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF PUBLICATIONS ' ' .  AT FIRST SIGHT , EVEN ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE TASKS DESCRIBED UNDER ( B ) ARE COVERED BY THE CONCEPT OF ' ' ADMINISTRATIVE , ADVISORY AND SUPERVISORY DUTIES ' '  TO WHICH ACCORDING TO THE NOTICE OF COMPETITION THE CANDIDATE ' S EXPERIENCE SHOULD RELATE , THE FACT REMAINS THAT IT APPEARS THAT THOSE DUTIES WERE PERFORMED OVER A PERIOD OF MONTHS , WHEREAS TWO YEARS '  FURTHER EXPERIENCE WAS REQUIRED .   IN RELATION TO THE URGENCY OF THE MEASURE REQUESTED BY THE APPLICANT , IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER , ON THE ONE HAND , THE FACT THAT THE DISADVANTAGES FOR THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF THE COMMISSION ' S DEPARTMENTS WHICH MIGHT RESULT FROM THE SUSPENSION OF AN OPEN COMPETITION AT PRESENT INVOLVING CANDIDATES AND INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE A RESERVE OF ADMINISTRATORS IN ORDER TO FILL SOME POSTS ARE MUCH MORE SERIOUS THAN THE CONSEQUENCES WHICH MIGHT RESULT FOR THE APPLICANT FROM THE REFUSAL TO SUSPEND THAT PROCEDURE , AND , ON THE OTHER HAND , THE FACT THAT IN ANY EVENT THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE APPLICANT ' S SUFFERING SERIOUS AND IRREPARABLE DAMAGE . OPEN COMPETITION NO COM/A/IS IN FACT INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE A RESERVE LIST OF ADMINISTRATORS , THE VALIDITY OF WHICH IS TO EXPIRE ON DECEMBER AND MAY BE EXTENDED . IF THE MAIN APPLICATION WERE TO BE ACCEPTED , THE APPLICANT MIGHT BE ADMITTED TO THE TESTS AFTER A FRESH EXAMINATION OF HIS APPLICATION AND IF HE PASSED THOSE TESTS , HE MIGHT BE INCLUDED ON THE RESERVE LIST BEFORE THE END OF THAT PERIOD , SO THAT HIS RIGHTS WOULD BE PROTECTED .   IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS , IT MIGHT BE CONCLUDED THAT THE CONDITIONS TO WHICH THE REQUESTED MEASURE IS SUBJECT ARE NOT FULFILLED AND THAT THE APPLICATION MUST THEREFORE BE DISMISSED .
