Grounds
By application lodged at the Court Registry on November 1999, the Commission of the European Communities brought an action under Article EC for a declaration that, by having failed to send the Commission the necessary reports on the implementation of:Article 13(1) of Council Directive 76/464/EEC of May on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment of the Community (OJ L 129, p. 23),Article of Council Directive 78/176/EEC of February on waste from the titanium dioxide industry (OJ L 54, p. 19), as amended by Council Directive 83/29/EEC of January (OJ L 32, p. 28),Article of Council Directive 78/659/EEC of July on the quality of fresh waters needing protection or improvement in order to support fish life (OJ L 222, p. 1), as amended most recently by the act concerning the conditions of accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic and the adjustments to the Treaties (OJ L 302, p. 23),Article 16(1) of Council Directive 80/68/EEC of December on the protection of groundwater against pollution caused by certain dangerous substances (OJ L 20, p. 43),Article 5(1) and the first paragraph of Article 5(2) of Council Directive 82/176/EEC of March on limit values and quality objectives for mercury discharges by the chlor-alkali electrolysis industry (OJ L 81, p. 29),Article 5(1) and (2) of Council Directive 83/513/EEC of September on limit values and quality objectives for cadmium discharges (OJ L 291, p. 1),Article 6(1) of Council Directive 84/156/EEC of March on limit values and quality objectives for mercury discharges by sectors other than the chlor-alkali electrolysis industry (OJ L 74, p. 49),Article 5(1) and (2) of Council Directive 84/491/EEC of October on limit values and quality objectives for discharges of hexachlorocyclohexane (OJ L 274, p. 11), andArticle 6(1) and (2) of Council Directive 86/280/EEC of June on limit values and quality objectives for discharges of certain dangerous substances included in List I of the Annex to Directive 76/464/EEC (OJ L 181, p. 16), as amended most recently by Council Directive 90/415/EEC of July (OJ L 219, p. 49),as those provisions are worded pursuant to amendment by Article 2(1) of Council Directive 91/692/EEC of December standardising and rationalising reports on the implementation of certain Directives relating to the environment (OJ L 377, p. 48), the Portuguese Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under the provisions of the directives mentioned above and under the first paragraph of Article 5, and the third paragraph of Article 189, of the EC Treaty (now, the first paragraph of Article EC and the third paragraph of Article EC).In the past, certain Community directives relating to the environment provided for the Member States to draw up a report on the implementation of the directives and for the Commission to draft a consolidated report. As the provisions regarding reports were diverse and dissimilar, Directive 91/harmonised the existing legislation concerning the preparation and submission of the reports.That directive requires the Member States' reports to be submitted at three-year intervals and provides that they are to be drawn up on the basis of a questionnaire prepared by the Commission, which is sent to the Member States six months before the start of the period covered by the report. The reports must then be sent to the Commission within nine months of the end of that period. The first period ran from to inclusive.Directive 91/applies, by virtue of Annex I thereto, to all the provisions at issue.Under Article 2(1) of Directive 91/692, the Portuguese Republic ought to have submitted the reports for the period to on the implementation of the directives at issue by September at the latest.As the Commission had not received any reports within the prescribed period, it sent the Portuguese Government a letter of formal notice on June 1998, asking it to submit observations on the alleged breach of its obligations within two months.The Portuguese authorities replied to the formal notice by letters dated October and November 1998, which provided certain information and stated principally that the authorities would not fail to send the Commission the reports on the implementation of the directives at issue.No reports on the relevant directives were forwarded to the Commission, which sent the Portuguese Government a reasoned opinion by letter dated February 1999, in which it requested the Government to take the measures necessary to fulfil its obligations under those directives within two months of notification of the opinion.On April 1999, the Portuguese Government sent the Commission a document compiling information obtained from the water quality authorities for the period to 1997, which forms the basis for drawing up the report on the implementation of Directives ... 76/464/EEC, 82/176/EEC, 83/513/EEC, 84/156/EEC, 84/491/EEC and 86/280/EEC and, on August 1999, it sent the Commission an identical document for the period to 1998, making clear in each case that the abovementioned report is being prepared and will be sent to the Commission as soon as it is available.Since it had received no reports, the Commission was unable to fulfil its own obligation to submit the consolidated Community report prescribed by Article 2(1) of Directive 91/692. It therefore decided to bring the present action.The Commission claims that the Portuguese Republic, by not forwarding the reports in question, has failed to fulfil its obligations under the first paragraph of Article 5, and the third paragraph of Article 189, of the Treaty.In its defence the Portuguese Government contends that it has already sent the Commission all the information available on Directives 76/464, 82/176, 83/513, 84/156, 84/and 86/280. The delay in drawing up the reports on those six directives is due to serious difficulties in the bodies responsible for completing the Commission's questionnaires. However, it should be possible to draw up the reports within a very short time.As to Directive 80/68, the Portuguese Government explains that the report will be submitted to the Commission as soon as it is available. So far as Directive 78/is concerned, the drafting process is nearing completion and the report was to reach the Commission by May at the latest. Concerning Directive 78/176, the Portuguese Government, while arguing that the obligation to forward a report to the Commission does not apply to it on the ground that no waste is produced on Portuguese territory by the titanium dioxide industry, has nevertheless annexed a response to the Commission's questionnaire to its defence.In its reply, the Commission confirms that the report on the implementation of Directive 78/has been sent to it. It has continued with the proceedings, however, claiming that whether a Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations must be determined by reference to the situation prevailing in that Member State at the end of the period prescribed by the reasoned opinion and that subsequent changes cannot be taken into account. The Commission adds that the fact that the report concerned was finally sent to it with the defence illustrates that it could have been submitted in good time by the Portuguese Government. Furthermore, Article of Directive 78/does not provide for any exceptions to the obligation to send the report to the Commission.It is not disputed that the reports on the implementation of Directives 76/464, 78/659, 80/68, 82/176, 83/513, 84/156, 84/and 86/did not reach the Commission within the prescribed period and that, consequently, the Commission's action in that connection must be regarded as well founded.As to the report on the implementation of Directive 78/176, which was sent to the Commission with the Portuguese Government's defence, it must be borne in mind that it is evident from the case-law of the Court of Justice that, in proceedings under Article EC, the question whether a Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations must be determined by reference to the situation prevailing in that Member State at the end of the period laid down in the reasoned opinion and that the Court cannot take account of any subsequent changes (see, inter alia, Case C-348/Commission v Luxembourg [2000] ECR I-2917, paragraph 8). In the present case, it has been established that, at the end of that period, the report had not been provided.The argument of the Portuguese Government that it was not required to submit a report on the implementation of Directive 78/on account of its particular situation, namely that there is no waste from the titanium dioxide industry on Portuguese territory (an argument which the government itself contradicted by subsequently sending the report), must in any event be rejected. As the Advocate General observes in point of his Opinion, the provision at issue binds all Member States in the same way and, if none of the activities referred to in Directive 78/are carried out in the territory of a Member State during the period under consideration, that State must indicate that fact in its report, which it may not dispense with under any circumstances.Therefore, it must be held that, by having failed to send the Commission the necessary reports on the implementation of:Article 13(1) of Directive 76/464,Article of Directive 78/176, as amended by Directive 83/29,Article of Directive 78/659, as amended most recently by the act concerning the conditions of accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic and the adjustments to the Treaties,Article 16(1) of Directive 80/68,Article 5(1) and the first paragraph of Article 5(2) of Directive 82/176,Article 5(1) and (2) of Directive 83/513,Article 6(1) of Directive 84/156,Article 5(1) and (2) of Directive 84/491, andArticle 6(1) and (2) of Directive 86/280, as amended most recently by Directive 90/415,as those provisions are worded pursuant to amendment by Article 2(1) of Directive 91/692, the Portuguese Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under the provisions of the directives mentioned above. 
Decision on costs
CostsUnder Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party's pleadings. Since the Commission has applied for costs and the Portuguese Republic has been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to pay the costs.
