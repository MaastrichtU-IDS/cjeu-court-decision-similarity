Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT OF THE IMPLIED REJECTION BY THE DEFENDANT OF THE APPLICANT' S REQUEST TO BE RECLASSIFIED IN CATEGORY B, CAREER BRACKET B 3/B 2, WITH RETROACTIVE EFFECT FROM JANUARY 1963, AND PAYMENT OF THE SALARY CORRESPONDING TO THIS CLASSIFICATION, 
Grounds
BY LETTER OF DECEMBER 1970, ADDRESSED TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION, THE APPLICANT LODGED A COMPLAINT WITH THE OBJECT OF SECURING HIS CLASSIFICATION IN CATEGORY B, CAREER BRACKET B 3/B 2, WITH RETROACTIVE EFFECT FROM JANUARY . SINCE HE DID NOT RECEIVE ANY REPLY TO THE COMPLAINT, HE BROUGHT THE PRESENT ACTION BEFORE THE COURT IN PURSUANCE OF THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS .  IN A STATEMENT ON A PROCEDURAL ISSUE, THE DEFENDANT COMMISSION RAISED AN OBJECTION OF ADMISSIBILITY ON THE GROUND THAT THE IMPLIED REJECTION, WHICH WAS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE SILENCE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION, WAS MERELY CONFIRMATION OF PREVIOUS DECISIONS WHICH COULD NO LONGER BE CONTESTED .  UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS, APPEALS AGAINST THE ACTS REFERRED TO IN THAT ARTICLE MUST BE LODGED WITHIN A PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS . THE OFFICIAL CONCERNED CANNOT REVIVE A LIMITATION PERIOD WHICH HE HAS ALLOWED TO LAPSE BY LODGING A COMPLAINT THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS ON THE SAME SUBJECT-MATTER AS AN ACT WHICH CAN NO LONGER BE CONTESTED AND BY INITIATING PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COURT ON AN ALLEGED IMPLIED REJECTION OF THAT COMPLAINT .  IT IS CLEAR FROM THE WORDING OF THE COMPLAINT OF DECEMBER THAT ITS OBJECT WAS TO OBTAIN THE APPLICANT' S RE-CLASSIFICATION WITH EFFECT FROM JANUARY . BY DECISION OF FEBRUARY OF THE EAEC COMMISSION, COMMUNICATED ON JULY 1963, THE APPLICANT, A SERVANT OF THE COMMUNITY SINCE 1959, WAS " INTEGRATED " AS CHIEF CLERK AND CLASSIFIED IN GRADE C 1, FIRST STEP, WITH EFFECT FROM JANUARY . BY COMPLAINT OF FEBRUARY, 1963, ADDRESSED TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE EAEC COMMISSION, HE ASKED TO BE CLASSIFIED IN A HIGHER GRADE . HE RECEIVED A REPLY BY LETTER OF SEPTEMBER STATING THAT AS THE COMMISSION DID NOT FIND THAT THERE WAS ANY INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN HIS GRADE AND THE LEVEL OF HIS DUTIES, IT COULD NOT ACCEPT THIS COMPLAINT .  NEITHER THE DECISION TO INTEGRATE HIM NOR THE COMMISSION' S REJECTION WAS CHALLENGED WITHIN THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED .  IT IS TRUE THAT, IN THE COURSE OF THE WRITTEN AND ORAL PROCEDURE, THE APPLICANT CONTENDED THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF NEW CIRCUMSTANCES AROSE, WHICH CHANGED HIS POSITION AND JUSTIFIED A RE-CLASSIFICATION . NEVERTHELESS, THE COMPLAINT THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS, THE IMPLIED REJECTION OF WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THE PRESENT PROCEEDINGS, SOUGHT HIS RE-CLASSIFICATION WITH RETROACTIVE EFFECT FROM JANUARY AND RELIED SOLELY ON CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH EXISTED PRIOR TO . NO REFERENCE TO THE NEW CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ARE ALLEGED TO HAVE ARISEN IN WAS MADE IN THAT COMPLAINT AND SUCH REFERENCE WOULD, MOREOVER, BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH ITS SUBJECT-MATTER INASMUCH AS IT WAS CONCERNED WITH RE-CLASSIFICATION WITH EFFECT FROM JANUARY .  GROUNDS WHICH HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF THE COMPLAINT OF DECEMBER CANNOT BE RELIED UPON TO SUPPORT OR ESTABLISH THE ADMISSIBILITY OF AN APPEAL AGAINST THE IMPLIED REJECTION OF THE COMPLAINT .  THE APPLICATION IS, IN CONSEQUENCE, INADMISSIBLE .  
Decision on costs
UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY SHALL BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .  THE APPLICANT HAS FAILED IN HIS SUBMISSIONS .  NEVERTHELESS UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, COSTS INCURRED BY THE INSTITUTIONS IN ACTIONS BROUGHT BY SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES ARE TO BE BORNE BY THE INSTITUTIONS .
