Grounds
BY INTERLOCUTORY JUDGMENT OF NOVEMBER (( ) ECR ) THE COURT ( FIRST CHAMBER ) ORDERED THE NECESSARY MEASURES FOR THE APPOINTMENT AND FUNCTIONING OF AN INVALIDITY COMMITTEE AS PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   AFTER THAT COMMITTEE HAD SUBMITTED ITS REPORT ON JANUARY THE COURT DECLARED IN A SECOND INTERLOCUTORY JUDGMENT OF MARCH (( ) ECR ) THAT THE APPLICATION HAD BECOME DEVOID OF PURPOSE SAVE WITH REGARD TO THE CLAIM RELATING TO THE REIMBURSEMENT OF THE MEDICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL EXPENSES SINCE THE SAID REPORT HAD NOT YET DEALT WITH THOSE EXPENSES .   IN A SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT SUBMITTED TO THE COURT ON JULY THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE SET OUT A STATEMENT OF THE MEDICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL EXPENSES TO BE REIMBURSED TO THE APPLICANT .   ON THE PARTIES '  BEING SUMMONED TO THE HEARING ON SEPTEMBER THE COMMISSION , AS DEFENDANT , DECLARED THAT IN THE MEANTIME IT HAD PAID THE SUM SPECIFIED IN THE SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT .   SINCE THE APPLICANT DID NOT APPEAR AT THE HEARING ON SEPTEMBER IT MUST BE CONCLUDED THAT HE CONTESTS NEITHER THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT NOR THAT HE HAS RECEIVED THE SUM DUE AND THEREFORE THAT HE HAS NO FURTHER CLAIM .   ACCORDINGLY THE CASE MAY BE ORDERED TO BE STRUCK OUT WITHOUT ITS BEING NECESSARY TO GIVE JUDGMENT .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  THE DEFENDANT HAS ASKED THAT THE APPLICANT BE ORDERED TO BEAR THE COSTS BECAUSE THE PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN UNDULY PROLONGED BY THE UNREASONABLE BEHAVIOUR OF THE MEMBER OF THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY THE APPLICANT .   ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT THE SAID BEHAVIOUR HAS BEEN IN A HIGH DEGREE UNREASONABLE AND REPREHENSIBLE , IT HAS HOWEVER NOT BEEN SHOWN THAT THIS HAS CAUSED THE DEFENDANT ANY ADDITIONAL COSTS .   IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE RULE IN ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE MUST APPLY AND EACH PARTY MUST BE ORDERED TO BEAR ITS OWN COSTS .
