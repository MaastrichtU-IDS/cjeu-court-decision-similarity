Operative part
The Court:
1.
	Declares that, having regard to the tourism and property complex ‘Is Arenas’ that affects the site ‘Is Arenas’;
–        by failing to adopt, before July 2006, the date on which the site ‘Is Arenas’ was included in the list of sites of Community
         importance, preservation measures that, having regard to the conservation aim of Council Directive 92/43/EEC of May on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, are suitable for the purpose of preserving the relevant
         ecological interest represented at national level by the proposed site of Community importance, and in particular by failing
         to prevent an activity likely seriously to endanger the ecological characteristics of the site; and
      
–        by failing to adopt, after July 2006, appropriate measures to prevent the deterioration of natural habitats in respect
         of which that site of Community importance was designated;
      
the Italian Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under Council Directive 92/and, more specifically, with regard
         to the second plea in law, Article 6(2) thereof;
      
2.
	Orders the Italian Republic to pay the costs.
