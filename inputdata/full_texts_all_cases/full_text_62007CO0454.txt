Order of the Court (Fifth Chamber) of May – Raulin v France
(Case C‑454/07)
Action brought by a natural person against a Member State and seeking a declaration that the Member State concerned has infringed
         Community law – Clear lack of jurisdiction of the Court
      
Actions for failure to fulfil obligations – Right of action reserved to the Commission and the Member States – Action brought by a natural or legal person – Inadmissible (Arts EC and EC) (see paras 6-7)
Re: 
Infringement, in a particular case, of Council Directive 87/344/EEC of June on the coordination of laws, regulations
                  and administrative provisions relating to legal expenses insurance (OJ L 185, p. 77).
               
Operative part
1.
	The Court of Justice of the European Communities manifestly has no jurisdiction to adjudicate in the present case. 
2.
	Mr Raulin is ordered to bear his own costs.
