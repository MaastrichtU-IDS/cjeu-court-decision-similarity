Subject of the case
OBJECTION , AT THE PRESENT STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS , THAT THE APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE IMPLIED DECISION REJECTING THE APPLICANT ' S COMPLAINT OF JUNE CONCERNING THE FAILURE TO PAY FAMILY AND EDUCATION ALLOWANCES FOR DEPENDENT CHILDREN AND THE REDUCTION OF THE PENSION ACQUIRED ON TERMINATION OF SERVICE UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF REGULATION NO 259/OF THE COUNCIL IS INADMISSIBLE , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JANUARY GIUSEPPE GRASSELLI , A FORMER OFFICIAL OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , BROUGHT AN ACTION SEEKING THE ANNULMENT OF THE IMPLIED DECISION REJECTING HIS COMPLAINT OF JUNE IN WHICH HE REQUESTED THAT HE BE PAID FAMILY AND EDUCATIONAL ALLOWANCES FOR DEPENDENT CHILDREN TOGETHER WITH PAYMENT OF A FULL EARLY RETIREMENT PENSION UNDER THE MEASURES FOR FINAL TERMINATION OF SERVICE WHICH WERE APPLIED TO HIM BY VIRTUE OF REGULATION NO 259/OF THE COUNCIL .   MR GRASSELLI ENTERED THE SERVICE OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY OF THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY ON OCTOBER AND WAS PLACED AS FROM FEBRUARY IN THE DIRECTORATE FOR STEEL WHICH BECAME , FOLLOWING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SINGLE COMMISSION FOR THE THREE COMMUNITIES , THE DIRECTORATE FOR STEEL IN DIRECTORATE-GENERAL III OF THE COMMISSION . ON APRIL HE SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION FOR TERMINATION OF HIS SERVICE IN APPLICATION OF REGULATION NO 259/OF THE COUNCIL OF FEBRUARY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ), ADAPTING THE PROVISIONS IN THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS AND THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OTHER SERVANTS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES TO THE NEW POSITION BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE MERGER OF THE EXECUTIVES AND LAYING DOWN FOR THAT PURPOSE ' ' SPECIAL MEASURES TEMPORARILY APPLICABLE TO OFFICIALS OF THE COMMISSION ' ' .   ARTICLE ( ) OF THAT REGULATION AUTHORIZED THE COMMISSION UNTIL JUNE TO ADOPT MEASURES TERMINATING THE SERVICE OF OFFICIALS WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS . PARAGRAPH ( ) OF THE SAME ARTICLE STATED THAT , IF THE INTERESTS OF THE SERVICE PERMITTED , THE COMMISSION WAS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT REQUESTS FOR TERMINATION OF SERVICE SUBMITTED BY OFFICIALS .   AN OFFICIAL IN RESPECT OF WHOM SUCH A MEASURE WAS ADOPTED WAS ENTITLED INITIALLY TO MONTHLY ALLOWANCES AND SUBSEQUENTLY TO A FULL EARLY RETIREMENT PENSION . ANY OFFICIAL WHO HAD NOT COMPLETED ELEVEN YEARS OF SERVICE COULD ,     HOWEVER , BY VIRTUE OF ARTICLE OF THE REGULATION , RENOUNCE HIS PENSION RIGHTS AND REQUEST THE AWARD OF A SEVERANCE GRANT PAYABLE UNDER THE CONDITIONS SET OUT IN ARTICLE OF ANNEX VIII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   SPECIAL PROVISIONS WERE ALSO LAID DOWN IN RESPECT OF FORMER OFFICIALS OF THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY WHO OPTED FOR APPLICATION OF THE EARLY RETIREMENT SCHEME . BY VIRTUE OF ARTICLE OF THE REGULATION , SUCH OFFICIALS WERE THUS ABLE TO ASK FOR THE PECUNIARY RIGHTS ATTACHING TO THEIR PENSION TO BE DETERMINED NOT UNDER ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 259/BUT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE ECSC STAFF REGULATIONS WHICH , IN THE CASE OF OFFICIALS WHO WERE ESTABLISHED PRIOR TO JANUARY AND WHO WERE IN GRADES OTHER THAN A AND A , WERE ESSENTIALLY THOSE OF ARTICLE .    THE PENSION SCHEME LAID DOWN BY THOSE PROVISIONS DIFFERED FROM THAT ESTABLISHED BY ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 259/BOTH AS REGARDS THE INITIAL ALLOWANCE , THE CALCULATION OF THE LENGTH OF SERVICE TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FOR PENSION PURPOSES AND THE CONDITIONS OF PAYMENT OF THE LATTER , AND AS REGARDS THE PECUNIARY RIGHTS ATTACHING TO THE PENSION . AS TO THE LATTER RIGHTS , THE PROVISIONS OF THE ECSC REGULATIONS , IN CONTRAST TO ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 259/, INCLUDED PAYMENT OF A REDUCED EARLY RETIREMENT PENSION AND DID NOT MAKE PROVISION FOR PAYMENT OF FAMILY AND EDUCATIONAL ALLOWANCES FOR DEPENDENT CHILDREN .   THE APPLICANT ASKED , ON APRIL , TO HAVE HIS SERVICE TERMINATED UNDER REGULATION NO 259/AND THE COMMISSION INFORMED HIM BY A LETTER OF JUNE THAT IT ACCEPTED HIS REQUEST AND , IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT HE HAD NOT COMPLETED BY THAT DATE THE ABOVE-MENTIONED ELEVEN YEARS OF SERVICE , ASKED HIM TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE AWARD OF THE PENSION AND PAYMENT OF A SEVERANCE GRANT . SHOULD HE OPT FOR THE AWARD OF PENSION , IT ASKED HIM TO INFORM THE ADMINISTRATION WHETHER HE PREFERRED HIS RIGHTS TO BE CALCULATED UNDER ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 259/OR UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF THE FORMER ECSC REGULATIONS . TO THAT END , THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL FOR PERSONNEL AND ADMINISTRATION SENT HIM ON SEPTEMBER AN EXPLANATORY TABLE SHOWING THE BENEFITS TO WHICH HE WOULD BE ENTITLED UNDER EACH OF THOSE TWO RETIREMENT SCHEMES AND DREW HIS ATTENTION , IN PARTICULAR , TO THE FACT THAT THE     SCHEME OF ARTICLE OF THE ECSC REGULATIONS INVOLVED PAYMENT OF A REDUCED EARLY RETIREMENT PENSION AND DID NOT MAKE PROVISION FOR FAMILY AND EDUCATIONAL ALLOWANCES FOR DEPENDENT CHILDREN .   AFTER SEEING THE EXPLANATORY TABLE THE APPLICANT SUBMITTED A COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS CLAIMING THAT APPLICATION OF ARTICLE OF THE ECSC STAFF REGULATIONS COULD NOT PREVENT THE AWARD OF A FULL EARLY RETIREMENT PENSION AND PAYMENT OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED ALLOWANCES , AND STATING THAT HE RESERVED HIS POSITION CONCERNING THE CHOICE BETWEEN THE TWO SCHEMES IN QUESTION PENDING A DECISION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE MATTER . IN VIEW OF THE EXPLANATIONS SUPPLIED BY THE COMMISSION THE APPLICANT BROUGHT AN ACTION BEFORE THE COURT ON DECEMBER . IN ITS JUDGMENT OF DECEMBER IN CASE 32/THE COURT DISMISSED THE APPLICATION AS INADMISSIBLE ON THE GROUND THAT THE ABOVE-MENTIONED EXPLANATIONS OF THE COMMISSION DID NOT AMOUNT TO AN ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING HIM (( ) ECR AT P . ).   ON BEING ASKED SUBSEQUENTLY BY THE COMMISSION TO MAKE HIS CHOICE AS TO THE SCHEME TO BE APPLIED IN RESPECT OF HIS RETIREMENT THE APPLICANT DECLARED BY A LETTER OF FEBRUARY THAT HE OPTED FOR THE SCHEME UNDER ARTICLE OF THE FORMER ECSC REGULATIONS , PRESSING AT THE SAME TIME FOR THE PROVISIONS IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 259/TO BE APPLIED IN HIS CASE WITH REGARD TO THE GRANT OF A WHOLE PENSION AND FAMILY AND EDUCATIONAL ALLOWANCES FOR DEPENDENT CHILDREN .   ON APRIL THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL FOR PERSONNEL AND ADMINISTRATION ADOPTED A FORMAL DECISION GRANTING THE APPLICANT AN EARLY RETIREMENT PENSION UNDER THE ABOVE-MENTIONED ARTICLE , AS FROM OCOTBER . IN A LETTER OF THE SAME DATE THE HEAD OF THE RELEVANT DIVISION OF THAT DIRECTORATE-GENERAL CONFIRMED TO THE APPLICANT THAT THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 259/WOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO HIM , AND SENT HIM A STATEMENT OF HIS PENSION RIGHTS SHOWING THAT HE WAS TO BE PAID A REDUCED PENSION WITHOUT FAMILY AND EDUCATION ALLOWANCES FOR DEPENDENT CHILDREN .   ON JUNE THE APPLICANT SUBMITTED A COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS SEEKING TO OBTAIN THOSE ALLOWANCES TOGETHER WITH A FULL     EARLY RETIREMENT PENSION . AS THE COMMISSION DID NOT REPLY TO THE COMPLAINT WITHIN THE PERIOD LAID DOWN BY THE REGULATIONS THE APPLICANT BROUGHT THE PRESENT PROCEEDINGS ON JANUARY .    BY A DOCUMENT DATED FEBRUARY , LODGED ON THE SAME DAY , THE COMMISSION MADE AN APPLICATION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE FOR THE APPLICATION TO BE DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE BECAUSE IT WAS COMMENCED OUT OF TIME AND WAS EQUALLY INADMISSIBLE HAVING REGARD TO ARTICLE OF ANNEX VIII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS . IN HIS WRITTEN OBSERVATIONS , LODGED ON MARCH , THE APPLICANT OPPOSES THE OBJECTION .  ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION   ( A ) OBSERVATION OF THE TIME-LIMIT FOR LODGING THE APPLICATION   IN SUPPORT OF ITS OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY THE COMMISSION FIRST CLAIMS THAT THE MEASURE ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE OFFICIAL , ON THE LAWFULNESS OF WHICH THE COURT IS ASKED TO PRONOUNCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , IS IN THIS CASE THE DECISION OF THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL FOR PERSONNEL AND ADMINISTRATION OF APRIL PLACING THE APPLICANT ON EARLY RETIREMENT UNDER THE CONDITIONS EXPRESSLY DEFINED BY THE APPROPRIATE DEPARTMENT OF THE COMMISSION , CONTAINED IN THE STATEMENT WHICH WAS SENT TO MR GRASSELLI ON THE SAME DAY .   THE APPLICANT , HOWEVER , MAINTAINS THAT NEITHER THE DECISION OF APRIL NOR THE STATEMENT ATTACHED TO THE LETTER OF THE SAME DATE NOR , LASTLY , THE MONTHLY NOTICES OF PAYMENT SENT TO HIM SUBSEQUENTLY , CAN BE CONSIDERED AS THE ACT WHICH ADVERSELY AFFECTED HIM . HE EXPLAINS ON THIS POINT THAT THE ABOVE-MENTIONED DECISION WAS RESTRICTED EXCLUSIVELY TO PROVIDING THAT HE BE PLACED ON EARLY RETIREMENT WITHOUT ACTUALLY DEFINING HIS PECUNIARY RIGHTS , AND THAT THE STATEMENT OF THOSE RIGHTS ATTACHED TO THE LETTER OF APRIL AMOUNTS , IN THE SAME WAY AS EACH OF THE NOTICES OF PAYMENT SENT TO HIM MONTHLY , TO A MERE ACCOUNTING RECORD DEVOID OF THE CHARACTER OF A DECISION .   IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT IN FACT ON THE VERY DAY ON WHICH THE DECISION OF THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF PERSONNEL AND ADMINISTRATION GRANTING HIM A PENSION PAYABLE ON EARLY RETIREMENT WAS ADOPTED , THE APPLICANT RECEIVED FROM THE HEAD OF THE RELEVANT DIVISION IN THAT DIRECTORATE-GENERAL A STATEMENT OF     HIS PECUNIARY RIGHTS SHOWING THAT THEY WERE THOSE PROVIDED FOR UNDER THE PENSION SCHEME LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE OF THE ECSC REGULATIONS FOR WHICH THE APPLICANT HAD OPTED AND WHICH HAD BEEN ALLOWED HIM ON THE BASIS OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED DECISION .   IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION BUT THAT THE ABOVE-MENTIONED STATEMENT WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE DECISION OF APRIL , THE LEGAL EFFECTS OF WHICH ON THE APPLICANT ' S FINANCIAL POSITION IT DEFINED , SO THAT AS REGARDS IN PARTICULAR PAYMENT OF THE REDUCED PENSION WITHOUT FAMILY AND EDUCATION ALLOWANCES FOR DEPENDENT CHILDREN , IT MUST BE CONSIDERED TO BE THE ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE APPLICANT .   AS THAT STATEMENT WAS SENT TO THE APPLICANT ON APRIL IT WAS FROM THAT DATE THAT THE PERIODS LAID DOWN IN ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS FOR THE LODGING OF A COMPLAINT AND AN APPLICATION UNDER THOSE ARTICLES AGAINST THE FINANCIAL POSITION RESULTING FROM THE DECISION OF APRIL AND IN PARTICULAR AS REGARDS THE APPLICATION OF A REDUCED RATE OF PENSION AND THE NON-PAYMENT OF THE ALLOWANCES IN QUESTION COMMENCED TO RUN .   THE NOTICES OF PAYMENT WHICH WERE SUBSEQUENTLY SENT TO THE APPLICANT EACH MONTH AND WHICH CONTAINED A STATEMENT OF HIS PECUNIARY RIGHTS WHICH CORRESPONDED TO THE FIRST STATEMENT CANNOT CAUSE THOSE PERIODS TO START TO RUN AFRESH . AS THE COURT HAS CONSISTENTLY HELD ( JUDGMENT OF APRIL IN CASE 24/, NEBE V COMMISSION , ( ) ECR ; JUDGMENT OF MAY IN CASE 33/, GUNNELLA V COMMISSION , ( ) ECR ), A MEASURE WHICH CONTAINS NO NEW FACTOR AS COMPARED WITH A PREVIOUS MEASURE CONSTITUTES A PURELY CONFIRMATORY MEASURE AND CANNOT THEREFORE HAVE THE EFFECT OF SETTING A FRESH TIME-LIMIT IN FAVOUR OF THE PERSON TO WHOM THE EARLIER MEASURE WAS ADDRESSED .   IT IS , HOWEVER , ESTABLISHED THAT THE APPLICANT DID NOT SUBMIT HIS COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AGAINST THE APPLICATION OF A REDUCED RATE OF PENSION AND THE FAILURE TO PAY THE ALLOWANCES REFERRED TO ABOVE UNTIL JUNE . WHILST IT IS TO BE REGRETTED THAT THE COMMISSION DID NOT CONSIDER IT NECESSARY TO REPLY TO THAT COMPLAINT , IN ACCORDANCE WITH ONE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF GOOD ADMINISTRATION , NEVERTHELESS THE FACT IS THAT THE COMPLAINT DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY NEW FACTOR AS COMPARED WITH THOSE PUT FORWARD BY THE APPLICANT EARLIER WHEN HIS SERVICE WAS TERMINATED IN AND     IN RELATION TO WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION HAD STATED ITS POSITION IN ITS LETTER OF APRIL .    IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IT MUST THEREFORE BE CONCLUDED THAT THE APPLICANT ' S COMPLAINT OF JUNE AND THIS APPLICATION , LODGED ON JANUARY , ARE TO BE HELD AS BEING BROUGHT OUT OF TIME AS REGARDS ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   ( B ) APPLICATION OF ARTICLE OF ANNEX VIII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS   IT IS ALSO ARGUED BY THE COMMISSION THAT THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF ANNEX VIII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS HAS THE SOLE PURPOSE OF ENABLING THE INSTITUTIONS TO RECALCULATE PENSIONS AT ANY TIME AND DOES NOT GIVE OFFICIALS ANY RIGHT OF ACTION FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING SUCH A RECALCULATION IRRESPECTIVE OF THE PERIODS PRESCRIBED FOR APPLICATIONS , WHICH ARE LAID DOWN GENERALLY IN ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   AGAINST THAT THE APPLICANT CLAIMS THAT THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF ANNEX VIII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS , BEING A SPECIFIC PROVISION IN THE RULES OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE PENSION SCHEME , MUST BE CONSIDERED , BOTH ON ITS WORDING AND ITS PURPOSE , AS A SPECIAL RULE WHICH DEROGATES FROM THE GENERAL SYSTEM APPLICABLE TO ACTIONS BROUGHT BY OFFICIALS AND GIVES THEM A RIGHT OF ACTION FOR THE RECALCULATION OF THEIR PENSIONS THE EXERCISE OF WHICH IS NOT SUBJECT TO OBSERVANCE OF THE TIME-LIMITS LAID DOWN IN ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF ANNEX VIII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS :    ' ' THE AMOUNT OF PENSION MAY AT ANY TIME BE CALCULATED AFRESH IF THERE HAS BEEN ERROR OR OMISSION OF ANY KIND . ' '   FOR A CORRECT INTERPRETATION OF THAT PROVISION IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH OFFICIALS MAY SEEK THE RECALCULATION OF THEIR PENSION REGARD MUST BE HAD TO THE SYSTEM LAID DOWN BY THE REGULATIONS GOVERNING DISPUTES AND THE UNDERLYING REQUIREMENTS OF THAT SYSTEM .   THE STAFF REGULATIONS MAKE GENERAL PROVISION IN ARTICLES AND FOR THE RIGHTS OF ACTION OF MEMBERS OF THE STAFF AGAINST ADMINISTRATIVE ACTS ADVERSELY AFFECTING THEM . THOSE PROVISIONS MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE SYSTEM FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES THEREBY ESTABLISHED IS BASED IN ITS ENTIRETY ON THE REQUIREMENT THAT EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT OF ACTION IS PERMITTED ONLY SUBJECT TO STRICT OBSERVANCE OF THE TIME-LIMITS WHICH HAVE BEEN LAID DOWN .       ANY OFFICIAL WHO SEEKS TO HAVE HIS PENSION RECALCULATED WHERE THERE HAS BEEN ERROR OR OMISSION OF ANY KIND MAY , IT IS TRUE , AVAIL HIMSELF OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF ANNEX VIII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS BY REQUESTING SUCH A RECALCULATION BY MEANS OF A COMPLAINT AND , IF NECESSARY , BY WAY OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS , BUT FOR HIS COMPLAINT AND HIS ACTION TO BE ADMITTED UNDER ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS HE MUST EXERCISE HIS RIGHT OF ACTION WITHIN THE PERIODS LAID DOWN BY THOSE ARTICLES , STARTING FROM THE TIME OF THE OCCURRENCE OF A NEW FACT SUCH AS TO JUSTIFY A RECALCULATION OF HIS PENSION OR FROM THE TIME WHEN HE ACTUALLY BECAME AWARE OF THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH A FACT .   IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE THE NEW FACT CAPABLE OF POSSIBLY JUSTIFYING A REQUEST FOR THE APPLICANT ' S PENSION TO BE RECALCULATED UNDER THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF ANNEX VIII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE RULES PUBLISHED BY THE COUNCIL SUBSEQUENT TO REGULATION NO 259/, WHICH INTRODUCED MEASURES CONCERNING THE TERMINATION OF SERVICE PROVIDING , FOR OFFICIALS WHO ARE SUBJECT TO SUCH MEASURES , FOR THE APPLICATION , INTER ALIA , OF A SCHEME FOR UNREDUCED PENSIONS PAYABLE ON EARLY RETIREMENT , TOGETHER WITH PAYMENT OF THE ALLOWANCES IN QUESTION .   THOSE RULES , WHICH ARE TO BE FOUND MAINLY IN REGULATION NO 1543/OF JUNE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ) WERE PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ON JUNE , BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL HIS COMPLAINT OF JUNE THAT THE APPLICANT MADE USE OF THE REMEDY AVAILABLE UNDER ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS IN ORDER TO CLAIM PAYMENT OF AN UNREDUCED PENSION AND OF THE ALLOWANCES IN QUESTION .   FROM THE WRITTEN OBSERVATIONS WHICH WERE SUBMITTED IN RESPECT OF THE COMMISSION ' S PRELIMINARY OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY , AND IN PARTICULAR PARAGRAPH ( ) OF THOSE OBSERVATIONS , IT APPEARS THAT THE APPLICANT WAS IN A POSITION ' ' SUBSEQUENTLY ' '  TO ASCERTAIN THAT ' ' THE INJUSTICE OF WHICH HE HAD COMPLAINED ' '  IN HIS FIRST ACTION OF DECEMBER ' ' HAD BEEN REMEDIED BY MEANS OF REGULATIONS NOS 2530/AND 1543/' ' . ANNEX TO THE APPLICATION SHOWS , IN ADDITION , THAT CONTACT BETWEEN ONE OF THE SPECIALIZED DEPARTMENTS OF THE DIRECTORATE-GENERAL FOR PERSONNEL AND ADMINISTRATION AND THE APPLICANT HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED IN , AT THE LATEST , AND THAT THAT CONTACT HAD RESULTED IN THE RECONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN OF THE APPLICANT ' S PECUNIARY RIGHTS .       THOSE FACTORS REVEAL THAT WHEN HE SUBMITTED HIS COMPLAINT ON JUNE THE EXISTENCE OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED RULES DID NOT CONSTITUTE AS FAR AS THE APPLICANT WAS CONCERNED A NEW FACT GIVING HIM THE RIGHT TO CLAIM UNDER ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS A RECALCULATION OF HIS PENSION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF ANNEX VIII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  CONCLUSION   IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THE DELAY IN THE SUBMISSION OF THAT COMPLAINT MUST BE CONSIDERED SUCH AS TO MAKE THIS ACTION INADMISSIBLE .
