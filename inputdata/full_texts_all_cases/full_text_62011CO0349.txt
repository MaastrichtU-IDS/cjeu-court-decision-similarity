Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Tribunal de première instance de Liège – Interpretation of Council Directive 97/81/EC
                  of December concerning the Framework Agreement on part-time work concluded by UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC (OJ 1998, L
                  14, p. 9) – Whether permissible for national legislation to require an employer to draw up documents recording departures
                  from work schedules and also to keep and make public the contracts and work schedules of part-time workers – Administrative
                  obstacles liable to limit the opportunities for part-time work.
               
Operative part 
Clause of the Framework Agreement annexed to Council Directive 97/81/EC of December concerning the Framework Agreement
         on part-time work concluded by UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which makes
         incumbent on employers the obligations to keep and to make public the contracts and work-schedules of part-time workers, if
         it is established that such legislation does not lead to their being treated less favourably than full-time workers in a similar
         situation or, if there is such a difference in treatment, it is established that it is justified on objective grounds and
         does not go beyond what is necessary to attain the objectives thus pursued. It is for the referring court to perform the necessary
         factual and legal investigation, particularly with regard to the applicable national law, in order to determine whether that
         is so in the case before it.
      
If the referring court were to conclude that the national legislation at issue is incompatible with Clause of the Framework
         Agreement on part-time work annexed to Directive 97/81, clause 5(1) thereof would also have to be interpreted as precluding
         such legislation.
