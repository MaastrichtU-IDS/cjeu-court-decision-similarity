HEIM  HAVING REGARD TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING AND FURTHER TO THE HEARING ON FEBRUARY 1987,  AFTER HEARING THE OPINION OF THE ADVOCATE GENERAL DELIVERED AT THE SITTING ON MARCH 1987,  GIVES THE FOLLOWING  JUDGMENT  
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON DECEMBER 1985, THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY PRIMARILY FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED THE PROVISIONS NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 82/603/EEC OF JULY AMENDING DIRECTIVE 75/130/EEC ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMON RULES FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF COMBINED ROAD/RAIL CARRIAGE OF GOODS BETWEEN MEMBER STATES . IN THE ALTERNATIVE, THE COMMISSION ASKED THE COURT TO DECLARE THAT, BY FAILING TO INFORM THE COMMISSION OF THE MEASURES ADOPTED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE AFORESAID DIRECTIVE, THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY .  THE PURPOSE OF DIRECTIVE 82/603/EEC IS, IN THE FIRST PLACE, TO EXTEND THE SYSTEM PROVIDED FOR BY DIRECTIVE 75/130/EEC TO COMBINED ROAD AND RAIL TRANSPORT BY INLAND WATERWAY BETWEEN MEMBER STATES AND, SECONDLY, TO REDUCE OR REIMBURSE TAXES APPLICABLE TO ROAD VEHICLES USED IN ALL COMBINED TRANSPORT . ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF DIRECTIVE 82/603/EEC, THE MEMBER STATES ARE TO TAKE THE MEASURES NECESSARY FOR THOSE PURPOSES BEFORE APRIL AND ARE TO INFORM THE COMMISSION THEREOF .  SINCE IT HAD NOT RECEIVED FROM THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT ANY INFORMATION RELATING TO THOSE MEASURES, ON JANUARY THE COMMISSION SENT THAT GOVERNMENT A LETTER FORMALLY REQUESTING IT TO SUBMIT ITS OBSERVATIONS . AS THAT LETTER EVOKED NO RESPONSE, ON FEBRUARY THE COMMISSION DELIVERED A REASONED OPINION UNDER THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY . SINCE THE REASONED OPINION ALSO FAILED TO EVOKE ANY RESPONSE, THE COMMISSION BROUGHT THIS ACTION .  REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING FOR THE SUBMISSIONS AND ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES, WHICH ARE REFERRED TO HEREINAFTER ONLY IN SO FAR AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE REASONING OF THE COURT .  IN THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COURT, THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT STATED, WITHOUT BEING CONTRADICTED BY THE COMMISSION, THAT, IN VIEW OF THE ABSENCE OF A NETWORK OF INLAND WATERWAYS LINKING ITALY AND THE OTHER MEMBER STATES, DIRECTIVE 82/603/EEC DOES NOT REQUIRE ITALY TO IMPLEMENT ANY PROVISIONS EXTENDING THE SYSTEM IN QUESTION TO COMBINED ROAD AND RAIL TRANSPORT BY INLAND WATERWAY .  WITH REGARD TO THE REDUCTION OR REIMBURSEMENT OF TAXES APPLICABLE TO ROAD VEHICLES, THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT CONTENDED THAT THE RELEVANT ITALIAN LEGISLATION ALREADY CONTAINED THE NECESSARY PROVISIONS, EXCEPT FOR CASES IN WHICH THE TRACTOR ITSELF, AND NOT JUST THE TRAILER, IS LOADED ON TO THE TRAIN . ALTHOUGH THAT MODE OF COMBINED TRANSPORT IS PRACTISED ON CERTAIN RAILWAY LINES IN NORTHERN ITALY, IT IS USED ONLY TO A VERY LIMITED EXTENT BY ITALIAN TRANSPORTERS .  IN THAT REGARD, IT MUST BE STATED THAT THE FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCE RELIED UPON BY THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT IS NOT SUCH AS TO EXPUNGE THE INFRINGEMENT WITH WHICH IT IS CHARGED . AS THE COMMISSION HAS EMPHASIZED, THE AIM OF THE CONTESTED DIRECTIVE IS TO PROMOTE CERTAIN TYPES COMBINED TRANSPORT, INCLUDING THOSE COMPRISING BOTH THE TRACTOR AND THE TRAILER . THE REDUCTION OR REIMBURSEMENT OF TAXES APPLICABLE TO ROAD VEHICLES MUST THEREFORE ALSO APPLY TO TRACTORS ACTUALLY USED IN THAT MANNER, EVEN IF THAT MODE OF TRANSPORT IS EMPLOYED ONLY ON A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF LINES .  IT MUST THEREFORE BE FOUND THAT, BY FAILING TO PROVIDE, WITHIN THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED BY COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 82/603/EEC OF JULY AMENDING DIRECTIVE 75/130/EEC ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMON RULES FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF COMBINED ROAD/RAIL CARRIAGE OF GOODS BETWEEN MEMBER STATES, FOR THEREDUCTION OR REIMBURSEMENT OF TAXES APPLICABLE TO ROAD VEHICLES AND CHARGED IN RESPECT OF TRACTORS USED IN COMBINED TRANSPORT OF THE TYPE IN WHICH NOT JUST THE TRAILER BUT ALSO THE TRACTOR ITSELF IS LOADED ON TO THE TRAIN, THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY .  SINCE AN INFRINGEMENT OF THE DIRECTIVE HAS THUS BEEN HELD TO EXIST, IT IS UNNECESSARY TO CONSIDER THE ALTERNATIVE CLAIM .  
Decision on costs
