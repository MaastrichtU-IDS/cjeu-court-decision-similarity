Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLES AND OF THE EEC TREATY , 
Grounds
BY A JUDGMENT OF MARCH , WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON APRIL AND CONFIRMED ON APPEAL BY THE COUR D ' APPEL ( COURT OF APPEAL ), AIX-EN-PROVENCE , BY JUDGMENT OF APRIL WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON MARCH , THE TRIBUNAL DE POLICE , MARTIGUES , REFERRED SEVERAL QUESTIONS TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLES AND OF THE EEC TREATY , SO AS TO ENABLE IT TO ASSESS THE COMPATIBILITY WITH COMMUNITY LAW OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION REQUIRING ALL RETAILERS TO ABIDE BY THE SELLING PRICES FOR BOOKS FIXED BY THE PUBLISHER OR IMPORTER .  THOSE QUESTIONS WERE RAISED IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST MR DARRAS AND MR TOSTAIN , WHO WERE PROSECUTED FOR HAVING SOLD IN SUPERMARKETS IN VITROLLES UNDER THEIR MANAGEMENT BOOKS AT PRICES BELOW THE RETAIL SELLING PRICE FIXED UNDER FRENCH LAW NO 81-OF AUGUST ON BOOK PRICES ( JOURNAL OFFICIEL DE LA REPUBLIQUE FRANCAISE OF AUGUST ).  UNDER THE LAW OF AUGUST ALL PUBLISHERS OR IMPORTERS ARE REQUIRED TO FIX RETAIL PRICES FOR THE BOOKS WHICH THEY PUBLISH OR IMPORT . RETAILERS MUST CHARGE AN EFFECTIVE PRICE FOR SALES TO THE PUBLIC OF BETWEEN 95% AND 100% OF THAT PRICE . THE LAW EXEMPTS CERTAIN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC ENTITIES , SUCH AS LIBRARIES AND EDUCATIONAL ESTABLISHMENTS , FROM HAVING TO PAY THAT PRICE AND IT AUTHORIZES CLEARANCE SALES , SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS . IF THE PROVISIONS OF THE LAW ARE CONTRAVENED , COMPETITORS AND VARIOUS TYPES OF ASSOCIATION MAY SEEK AN INJUNCTION OR CLAIM DAMAGES ; CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS MAY ALSO BE BROUGHT .  AS FAR AS IMPORTED BOOKS ARE CONCERNED , THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE LAW PROVIDES THAT ' WHERE IMPORTED BOOKS WERE PUBLISHED IN FRANCE THE RETAIL PRICE FIXED BY THE IMPORTER SHALL BE NO LESS THAN THAT FIXED BY THE PUBLISHER ' . DECREE NO 81-OF DECEMBER ( JOURNAL OFFICIEL DE LA REPUBLIQUE FRANCAISE OF DECEMBER ), ISSUED PURSUANT TO THE LAW OF AUGUST , FURTHER PROVIDES THAT THE PRINCIPAL DISTRIBUTOR OF IMPORTED BOOKS WHO MUST COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENT LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE OF THE LAW OF JUNE - NAMELY THE REQUIREMENT THAT A COMPLETE COPY MUST BE DEPOSITED WITH THE MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR - IS DEEMED TO BE THE IMPORTER .  THE TRIBUNAL DE POLICE , MARTIGUES , REFERRED THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING :    ' . DOES THE LEGISLATION ON THE PRICE OF BOOKS , IN PARTICULAR THE FIXING OF AN ACTUAL MINIMUM RETAIL PRICE , AS ENACTED IN LAW NO 81-OF AUGUST AND DECREE NO 82-OF DECEMBER , CONSTITUTE A MEASURE HAVING AN EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO QUANTITATIVE RESTRICTIONS ON INTRA-COMMUNITY TRADE?   . IF SO , IS THAT LEGISLATION CAPABLE OF FALLING WITHIN THE EXCEPTIONS LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE OF THE TREATY OF ROME?   . IF NOT , MAY IT BE JUSTIFIED ON THE GROUNDS OF THE PROTECTION OF CERTAIN NATIONAL INTERESTS , FOR INSTANCE THAT OF BOOKSHOPS THREATENED BY COMPETITION FROM OTHER FORMS OF DISTRIBUTION?   . IF SO , ARE THE MEASURES ADOPTED THE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR PROTECTING THOSE INTERESTS AND THE LEAST LIMITATIVE OF FREEDOM OF TRADE?  '  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT A QUESTION FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING RELATING , IN PARTICULAR , TO THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLES AND OF THE EEC TREATY WAS SUBMITTED BY THE COUR D ' APPEL , POITIERS , IN PROCEEDINGS CONCERNING FAILURE TO OBSERVE THE RETAIL PRICE FIXED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF AUGUST AND WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF JANUARY ( CASE 229/ASSOCIATION DES CENTRES DISTRIBUTEURS LECLERC V SARL AU BLE VERT AND OTHERS ( ) ECR ).  CONSIDERATION OF THE PRESENT CASE HAS REVEALED NOTHING THAT WAS NOT ALREADY KNOWN TO THE COURT IN CASE 229/. IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS SUFFICIENT TO REFER TO THE GROUNDS OF THE JUDGMENT OF JANUARY , A COPY OF WHICH SHALL BE ANNEXED TO THE PRESENT JUDGMENT .  CONSEQUENTLY QUESTIONS , AND SUBMITTED BY THE TRIBUNAL DE POLICE , MARTIGUES , MUST BE ANSWERED IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS :    ( I ) IN THE CONTEXT OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION WHEREBY THE RETAIL PRICE OF BOOKS MUST BE FIXED BY THE PUBLISHER OR THE IMPORTER AND IS BINDING ON ALL RETAILERS , THE FOLLOWING CONSTITUTE MEASURES EQUIVALENT IN EFFECT TO QUANTITATIVE RESTRICTIONS ON IMPORTS , CONTRARY TO ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY :    ( A ) PROVISIONS WHEREBY THE IMPORTER RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLYING WITH THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENT TO DEPOSIT ONE COPY OF EACH IMPORTED BOOK WITH THE AUTHORITIES , THAT IS TO SAY THE PRINCIPAL DISTRIBUTOR , IS RESPONSIBLE FOR FIXING THE RETAIL PRICE ;   ( B)PROVISIONS REQUIRING THE RETAIL PRICE FIXED BY THE PUBLISHER TO BE APPLIED TO BOOKS PUBLISHED IN THE MEMBER STATE CONCERNED AND RE-IMPORTED FOLLOWING EXPORTATION TO ANOTHER MEMBER STATE , UNLESS IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT THOSE BOOKS WERE EXPORTED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF RE-IMPORTATION IN ORDER TO CIRCUMVENT THE LEGISLATION IN QUESTION .   ( II)SUCH MEASURES ARE NOT JUSTIFIED BY ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY OR BY THE OVERRIDING REQUIREMENTS OF THE SAFEGUARDING OF CONSUMERS '  INTERESTS OR THE PROTECTION OF CREATIVITY AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY IN THE REALM OF PUBLISHING .
