APPLICATION FOR THE SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF A DECISION TAKEN BY THE COMMISSION WHEREBY THE APPLICANT CAN DEVOTE ONLY % OF HIS TIME TO HIS WORK WITH A GROUP OF EXPERTS ESTABLISHED BY THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY ( IAEA ) TO STUDY THE STATUS AND PROSPECTS OF THERMAL BREEDER REACTORS , 
Grounds
RECOURSE TO INTERIM MEASURES UNDER ARTICLES TO OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE IS CONDITIONAL UPON ESTABLISHING THE URGENCY OF THE MEASURES REQUESTED .   IT IS CLEAR FROM THE FOREGOING THAT THE DECISION OF WHICH THE APPLICANT REQUESTS THE SUSPENSION WAS ALREADY IN FORCE WHEN HIS MAIN APPLICATION WAS LODGED , AND THAT AT THAT TIME THE IAEA HAD ALREADY ADOPTED DEFINITIVE MEASURES ON THE BASIS OF THE DECISION TAKEN BY THE APPLICANT ' S SUPERIORS .   IT IS THUS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOLD THAT THE MATTER IS URGENT .   IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS UNNECESSARY TO CONSIDER AT THIS STAGE THE OBJECTIONS RAISED BY THE COMMISSION AGAINST THE SPECIFIC GROUNDS FOR THE INTERIM MEASURE REQUESTED BY THE APPLICANT .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECOND CHAMBER OF THE COURT ,   BY WAY OF AN INTERIM RULING , HEREBY  ORDERS :   . THE APPLICATION IS DISMISSED ;  . THE COSTS ARE RESERVED .
