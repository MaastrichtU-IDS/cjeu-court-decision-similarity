IN CASE 124/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE ECONOMISCHE POLITIERECHTER OF THE ARRONDISSEMENTSRECHBANK , ROTTERDAM , FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE PROCEEDINGS PENDING BEFORE IT BETWEEN  OFFICIER VAN JUSTITIE  AND  J . VAN DAM & ZONEN  
Subject of the case
ON THE CONFORMITY WITH COMMUNITY LAW OF THE INTERIM MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE NETHERLANDS AUTHORITIES LAYING DOWN FOR LIMITATIONS OF CATCHES OF SEA FISH OTHER THAN SOLE AND PLAICE , 
Grounds
BY JUDGMENT OF MARCH , WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON MAY , THE ECONOMISCHE POLITIERECHTER ( MAGISTRATE DEALING WITH COMMERCIAL OFFENCES ) OF THE ARRONDISSEMENTSRECHTBANK ( DISTRICT COURT ), ROTTERDAM REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY A QUESTION AS TO THE INTERPRETATION OF THE COMMUNITY PROVISIONS ON THE CONSERVATION OF FISHERY RESOURCES FOR THE YEAR IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER MEASURES ENACTED BY THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT FOR LAYING DOWN LIMITATIONS ON CATCHES OF SEA FISH OTHER THAN SOLE AND PLAICE ARE COMPATIBLE WITH COMMUNITY LAW .   AT THE BEGINNING OF THE COUNCIL , TO WHICH THE COMMISSION , IN PURSUANCE OF ARTICLE OF THE ACT OF ACCESSION , HAD PROPOSED THE ADOPTION OF A SERIES OF MEASURES FOR THE CONSERVATION OF FISHERY RESOURCES IN THE WATERS UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE MEMBER STATES , FAILED TO ADOPT THE NECESSARY PROVISIONS . IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE COUNCIL ADOPTED INTERIM MEASURES WHICH , APPLIED FOR LIMITED PERIODS , WERE EXTENDED FROM TIME TO TIME . THESE DECISIONS , THE WORDING OF WHICH IS SIMILAR , ARE DATED DECEMBER ( NOT PUBLISHED ), APRIL , NO 79/( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ) AND JUNE , NO 79/( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ) AND OCTOBER , NO 79/( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ). THE DECISION OF JUNE , WHICH WAS APPLICABLE AT THE TIME OF THE EVENTS WHICH GAVE RISE TO THIS CASE , IS WORDED AS FOLLOWS :       ' ' COUNCIL DECISION  OF JUNE UNDER THE TREATIES , CONCERNING FISHERY ACTIVITIES IN WATERS UNDER THE SOVEREIGNTY OR JURISDICTION OF MEMBER STATES , TAKEN ON A TEMPORARY BASIS PENDING THE ADOPTION OF PERMANENT COMMUNITY MEASURES   ( 79/590/EEC )   THE COUNCIL INTENDS TO REACH AN AGREEMENT AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE IN ON COMMUNITY MEASURES FOR THE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF FISHERY RESOURCES AND RELATED MATTERS . PENDING ITS DECISION IN THE MATTER AND IN VIEW BOTH OF ARTICLE OF THE ACT OF ACCESSION AND OF THE NEED TO PROTECT THE BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES AND TO MAINTAIN SUITABLE RELATIONS WITH THIRD COUNTRIES IN FISHERIES MATTERS , THE COUNCIL , ON DECEMBER AND APRIL , ADOPTED INTERIM MEASURES WHICH WERE IN FORCE FROM JANUARY TO MARCH AND FROM APRIL TO JUNE RESPECTIVELY . FOLLOWING ON FROM THESE MEASURES , THE COUNCIL HAS DECIDED ON THE FOLLOWING INTERIM MEASURES WHICH WILL APPLY FROM JULY UNTIL THE COUNCIL HAS REACHED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT OR UNTIL OCTOBER , WHICHEVER IS THE EARLIER .  . MEMBER STATES SHALL CONDUCT THEIR FISHERY IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE CATCHES OF THEIR VESSELS DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD SHALL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT TACS ( TOTAL ALLOWABLE CATCHES ) SUBMITTED BY THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL IN THEIR COMMUNICATIONS OF NOVEMBER AND FEBRUARY AND THE PART OF THE TACS MADE AVAILABLE TO THIRD COUNTRIES UNDER AGREEMENTS OR ARRANGEMENTS MADE WITH THEM BY THE COMMUNITY . THE CATCHES TAKEN IN THE INTERIM PERIOD WILL BE OFFSET AGAINST THE ALLOCATIONS EVENTUALLY DECIDED UPON BY THE COUNCIL FOR .   . AS REGARDS TECHNICAL MEASURES FOR THE CONSERVATION AND SURVEILLANCE OF FISHERY RESOURCES , MEMBER STATES SHALL APPLY THE SAME MEASURES AS THEY APPLIED ON NOVEMBER , AND OTHER MEASURES TAKEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURES AND CRITERIA OF ANNEX VI TO THE COUNCIL RESOLUTION OF NOVEMBER . ' '    BY A DECISION ( BESCHIKKING ) NO J ( NEDERLANDSE STAATSCOURANT ( NETHERLANDS OFFICIAL JOURNAL ) 1978-) OF DECEMBER , THE NETHERLANDS MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES LAID DOWN FOR INTERIM MEASURES ON THE LIMITATION OF CATCHES OF SEA FISH OTHER THAN SOLE AND PLAICE . THESE ARRANGEMENTS , WHICH WERE EXTENDED BY DECISION NO J OF     JUNE ( NEDERLANDSE STAATSCOURANT , 1979-), WERE AMENDED BY DECISION NO J OF AUGUST ( NEDERLANDSE STAATSCOURANT , 1979-) PROHIBITING THE CATCHING AND UNLOADING OF COD IN A SPECIFIED ZONE . ON JULY THE COMMISSION FOUND THAT THE INTERIM MEASURES THEREBY LAID DOWN BY THE NETHERLANDS AUTHORITIES WERE IN CONFORMITY WITH THE COUNCIL DECISIONS OF DECEMBER AND OF APRIL AND JUNE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL C , P . ). ON NOVEMBER IT FOUND THOSE MEASURES WERE IN CONFORMITY WITH THE COUNCIL DECISION OF OCTOBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL C , P . ).   IN OCTOBER A BOAT BELONGING TO THE VAN DAM UNDERTAKING CAUGHT AND UNLOADED COD IN THE PORT OF STELLENDAM ( NETHERLANDS ) IN BREACH OF THE DECISION OF AUGUST . VAN DAM , AGAINST WHICH PROCEEDINGS WERE INSTITUTED ON THAT COUNT BEFORE THE ECONOMISCHE POLITIERECHTER , CONTENDED THAT THE NETHERLANDS MEASURES WERE CONTRARY TO COMMUNITY LAW . BEFORE GIVING FINAL JUDGMENT THE ECONOMISCHE POLITIERECHTER DECIDED TO SUBMIT THE FOLLOWING PRELIMINARY QUESTION TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE :    ' ' ARE THE MEASURES ADOPTED FOR BY THE NETHERLANDS AUTHORITIES , SUCH AS THE REGULATIONS REFERRED TO IN THE SUMMONS , NAMELY THE DECISION LAYING DOWN FOR INTERIM MEASURES ON THE LIMITATION OF CATCHES OF SEA FISH OTHER THAN SOLE AND PLAICE ( BESCHIKKING VOORLOPIGE REGELING VANGSTBEPERKING ANDERE ZEEVISSOORTEN DAN TONG EN SCHOL ) ( NEDERLANDSE STAATSCOURANT 1979-) AND THE DECISION ( BESCHIKKING ) OF AUGUST UNDER NO J ( NEDERLANDSE STAATSCOURANT NO OF AUGUST ) BASED ON COMMUNITY LAW?  ' '   ACCORDING TO THE DEFENDANT IN THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS , AT THE END OF THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF THE ACT OF ACCESSION THERE WAS A LEGAL VACUUM REGARDING THE POLICY OF CONSERVATION OF THE BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES OF THE SEA WHICH THE DECISIONS OF THE COUNCIL DID NOT MAKE GOOD . FURTHERMORE , EVEN IF IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SUCH WAS THEIR OBJECTIVE THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN THE FORM PRESCRIBED IN ARTICLE OF COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 101/OF JANUARY LAYING DOWN A COMMON STRUCTURAL POLICY FOR THE FISHING INDUSTRY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ). SINCE THE PROCEDURE PRESCRIBED BY THAT ARTICLE WAS NOT FOLLOWED THE DECISIONS OF THE COUNCIL ARE IN ANY CASE VOID .   THE COUNCIL DOES NOT DISPUTE THAT THE DECISIONS IN QUESTION WERE NOT IN THE FORM PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 101/BUT CLAIMS THAT THE     REGULATION DOES NOT APPLY TO THOSE DECISIONS . THOSE DECISIONS ARE AD HOC MEASURES TAKEN BY THE COUNCIL IN ORDER TO PRESERVE , IN A WAY NOT PROVIDED FOR BY REGULATION NO 101/, THE BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES OF THE SEA ; THEY CRYSTALLIZE CERTAIN SITUATIONS AND , AT THE SAME TIME , ENTAIL A ' ' LIMITED RESTORATION OF CERTAIN POWERS ' '  TO THE MEMBER STATES . REGULATION NO 101/IS IN FACT OBSOLETE AND IS NO LONGER SUFFICIENT TO MEET PROBLEMS THE SCOPE OF WHICH WAS NOT ENVISAGED AT THE TIME WHEN IT WAS DRAFTED .   THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT RECALLS THAT FISHERIES AND MORE PRECISELY THE CONSERVATION OF MARINE SPECIES ARE COVERED BY THE POWERS EXPRESSLY TRANSFERRED TO THE COMMUNITY AND STRESSES THAT ON DECEMBER ALL NATIONAL POWERS IN THE MATTER OF CONSERVATION MEASURES DISAPPEARED TOTALLY AND IRREVERSIBLY . A FUNDAMENTAL DISTINCTION MUST THEREFORE BE MADE , IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXISTING CASE-LAW OF THE COURT , BETWEEN THE PERIOD WHICH EXPIRED ON DECEMBER AND THE ENSUING PERIOD . HENCEFORTH THE POWER TO ADOPT MEASURES FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES OF THE SEA COMES WITHIN THE COMPETENCE OF THE COMMUNITY ALONE AND MORE PRECISELY OF THE COUNCIL . THE COUNCIL CANNOT , WITHOUT DISREGARDING THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF THE ACT OF ACCESSION , RESTORE TO THE MEMBER STATES A POWER WHICH THEY HAVE DEFINITIVELY LOST . HAVING REGARD TO THESE LEGAL FACTS , THE DECISIONS ADOPTED BY THE COUNCIL MUST BE UNDERSTOOD AS DECISIONS CRYSTALLIZING AND FIXING THE CONSERVATION MEASURES AS THEY EXISTED AT THE EXPIRATION OF THAT TRANSITIONAL PERIOD AND NOT AS DECISIONS DELEGATING OR TRANSFERRING POWER TO THE MEMBER STATES . THE NEW MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT THUS EMANATE FROM AN AUTHORITY WHICH IS NOT EMPOWERED TO ADOPT THEM .   ALTHOUGH THE COMMISSION , THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM PLACE A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION UPON THE DECISIONS OF THE COUNCIL , THEY DO NOT , HOWEVER , DOUBT THEIR LAWFULNESS . WITH REGARD TO THE MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT FOR THE YEAR , THEY CONSIDER THAT , SINCE THEY WERE FORMALLY APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION , THEY ARE IN ANY CASE IN CONFORMITY WITH THE DECISIONS OF THE COUNCIL AND ACCORDINGLY WITH COMMUNITY LAW .       IT SHOULD BE RECALLED IN THIS CONNEXION THAT THE COURT , IN ITS JUDGMENT OF MAY ( COMMISSION V UNITED KINGDOM CASE 804/), WHILST EMPHASIZING THAT SINCE THE END OF THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF THE ACT OF ACCESSION THERE HAS BEEN A TOTAL TRANSFER OF POWERS TO THE COMMUNITY , STATED IN ITS JUDGMENT THAT , IT IS NOT POSSIBLE , ON THE BASIS OF THE FAILURE OF THE COUNCIL TO ACT IN THAT MATTER TO EXTEND THAT IDEA TO THE POINT OF MAKING IT ENTIRELY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE MEMBER STATES TO AMEND THE EXISTING CONSERVATION MEASURES IN CASE OF NEED OWING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RELEVANT BIOLOGICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL FACTS IN THIS SPHERE . IT ADDED THAT SUCH AMENDMENTS WOULD BE OF A LIMITED SCOPE ONLY AND COULD NOT INVOLVE A NEW CONSERVATION POLICY ON THE PART OF A MEMBER STATE , SINCE THE POWER TO LAY DOWN SUCH A POLICY BELONGS HENCEFORTH TO THE COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS .   WITH REGARD TO THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH NATIONAL CONSERVATION MEASURES MAY BE TAKEN , THE COURT TOOK THE FOLLOWING VIEW :    ' ' AS THIS IS A FIELD RESERVED TO THE POWERS OF THE COMMUNITY , WITHIN WHICH MEMBER STATES MAY HENCEFORTH ACT ONLY AS TRUSTEES OF THE COMMON INTEREST , A MEMBER STATE CANNOT THEREFORE , IN THE ABSENCE OF APPROPRIATE ACTION ON THE PART OF THE COUNCIL , BRING INTO FORCE ANY INTERIM CONSERVATION MEASURES WHICH MAY BE REQUIRED BY THE SITUATION EXCEPT AS PART OF A PROCESS OF COLLABORATION WITH THE COMMISSION AND WITH DUE REGARD TO THE GENERAL TASK OF SUPERVISION WHICH ARTICLE , IN CONJUNCTION , IN THIS CASE , WITH THE DECISION OF JUNE AND THE PARALLEL DECISIONS , GIVES TO THE COMMISSION .  THUS , IN A SITUATION CHARACTERIZED BY THE INACTION OF THE COUNCIL AND BY THE MAINTENANCE , IN PRINCIPLE , OF THE CONSERVATION MEASURES IN FORCE AT THE EXPIRATION OF THE PERIOD LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE OF THE ACT OF ACCESSION , THE DECISION OF JUNE AND THE PARALLEL DECISIONS , AS WELL AS THE REQUIREMENTS INHERENT IN THE SAFEGUARD BY THE COMMUNITY OF THE COMMON INTEREST AND THE INTEGRITY OF ITS OWN POWERS IMPOSED UPON MEMBER STATES NOT ONLY AN OBLIGATION TO UNDERTAKE DETAILED CONSULTATIONS WITH THE COMMISSION AND TO SEEK ITS APPROVAL IN GOOD FAITH , BUT ALSO A DUTY NOT TO LAY DOWN NATIONAL CONSERVATION MEASURES IN SPITE OF OBJECTIONS , RESERVATIONS OR CONDITIONS WHICH MIGHT BE FORMULATED BY THE COMMISSION . ' '       CONSIDERATION IN THE LIGHT OF THE STATE OF THE LAW THUS DEFINED OF THE MEASURES WHICH HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO BY THE NATIONAL COURT AND WHICH WERE TAKEN IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED ABOVE , DISCLOSES NO FACTOR OF SUCH A KIND AS TO CAST DOUBTS UPON THEIR CONFORMITY WITH COMMUNITY LAW IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THEY WERE FORMALLY APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION .   THE REPLY TO THE QUESTION SUBMITTED MUST ACCORDINGLY BE THAT NATIONAL MEASURES CONCERNING THE CONSERVATION OF THE BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES OF THE SEA SUCH AS THOSE ENACTED BY THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT FOR THE YEAR CONCERNING THE LIMITATION OF CATCHES OF SEA FISH OTHER THAN SOLE AND PLAICE ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH COMMUNITY LAW TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH , HAVING BEEN ENACTED BY REASON OF A FAILURE TO ACT ON THE PART OF THE COUNCIL , THEY HAVE RECEIVED , FOLLOWING CONSULTATION , THE FORMAL APPROVAL OF THE COMMISSION .  
Decision on costs
THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE NETHERLANDS , THE GOVERNMENT OF THE FRENCH REPUBLIC , THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM , THE COMMISSION AND THE COUNCIL , WHICH HAVE SUBMITTED OBSERVATIONS TO THE COURT , ARE NOT RECOVERABLE . AS THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE , IN SO FAR AS THE PARTIES TO THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS ARE CONCERNED , IN THE NATURE OF A STEP IN THE PROCEEDINGS PENDING BEFORE THE NATIONAL COURT , THE DECISION ON COSTS IS A MATTER FOR THAT COURT .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ,   IN ANSWER TO THE QUESTIONS REFERRED TO IT BY THE ECONOMISCHE POLITIERECHTER OF THE ARRONDISSEMENTSRECHTBANK , ROTTERDAM , BY JUDGMENT OF MARCH , HEREBY RULES :   NATIONAL MEASURES CONCERNING THE CONSERVATION OF THE BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES OF THE SEA SUCH AS THOSE ENACTED BY THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT FOR THE YEAR CONCERNING THE LIMITATION OF CATCHES OF     SEA FISH OTHER THAN SOLE AND PLAICE ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH COMMUNITY LAW TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH , HAVING BEEN ENACTED BY REASON OF A FAILURE TO ACT ON THE PART OF THE COUNCIL , THEY HAVE RECEIVED , FOLLOWING CONSULTATION , THE FORMAL APPROVAL OF THE COMMISSION .
