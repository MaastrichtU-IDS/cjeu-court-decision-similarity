IN CASE 104/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE TRIBUNAL DU TRAVAIL ( LABOUR COURT ), BRUSSELS , FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE PROCEEDINGS PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  SALVATORE CINCIUOLO  AND  . UNION NATIONALE DES FEDERATIONS MUTUALISTES NEUTRES  AND  . INSTITUT NATIONAL D ' ASSURANCE MALADIE-INVALIDITE  
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE APPLICATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEMES TO EMPLOYED PERSONS AND THEIR FAMILIES MOVING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P . ), 
Grounds
BY A JUDGMENT OF MAY , WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON JUNE , THE TRIBUNAL DU TRAVAIL , BRUSSELS , REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY A QUESTION ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1408/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE APPLICATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEMES TO EMPLOYED PERSONS AND THEIR FAMILIES MOVING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P . ).   THE QUESTION WAS RAISED IN PROCEEDINGS BETWEEN SALVATORE CINCIUOLO , AN ITALIAN NATIONAL , AND , INTER ALIA , THE INSTITUT NATIONAL D ' ASSURANCE MALADIE-INVALIDITE ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS THE ' ' INSTITUT NATIONAL ' ' ), A BELGIAN SOCIAL SECURITY INSTITUTION .   MR CINCIUOLO HAS BEEN RECEIVING SINCE FEBRUARY AN INVALIDITY ALLOWANCE UNDER BELGIAN LEGISLATION . HE ALSO RECEIVES TWO ITALIAN BENEFITS , NAMELY AN APPORTIONED INVALIDITY PENSION CALCULATED ACCORDING TO THE AGGREGATION AND APPORTIONMENT PRINCIPLES CONTAINED IN ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/AND AN OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE BENEFIT .   THE TWO ITALIAN BENEFITS WERE SET OFF AGAINST THE BELGIAN BENEFIT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE BELGIAN LAW OF AUGUST . THAT REDUCTION , PURSUANT     TO A BELGIAN PROVISION AGAINST THE OVERLAPPING OF BENEFITS , WAS MORE FAVOURABLE TO MR CINCIUOLO THAN THAT RESULTING FROM THE APPLICATION OF THE AGGREGATION AND APPORTIONMENT PRINCIPLES CONTAINED IN ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/AND IS NOT CHALLENGED BY HIM .   FOLLOWING THE INCREASE AS FROM JULY IN THE ITALIAN OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE BENEFIT THE INSTITUT NATIONAL REDUCED THE BELGIAN BENEFIT BY A CORRESPONDING AMOUNT AS FROM THE SAME DATE . AFTER A FURTHER INCREASE IN THE ITALIAN BENEFIT ON JULY THE INSTITUT NATIONAL AGAIN REDUCED THE BELGIAN BENEFIT .   MR CINCIUOLO CHALLENGED THE TWO REDUCTIONS BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL DU TRAVAIL , BRUSSELS , ON THE GROUND THAT THEY HAD BEEN MADE IN BREACH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/. THE INSTITUT NATIONAL CONTENDED THAT ARTICLE APPLIED ONLY TO PENSIONS AND THAT THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF EXTENDING ITS APPLICATION TO BENEFITS OF ANOTHER KIND .   THE TRIBUNAL DU TRAVAIL STAYED THE PROCEEDINGS AND REFERRED THE FOLLOWING QUESTION TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING :    ' ' DOES ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1408/OF JUNE APPLY SOLELY TO THE INVALIDITY , OLD-AGE AND SURVIVOR ' S PENSIONS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE OR DOES IT ALSO APPLY TO BENEFITS OF A DIFFERENT NATURE , SUCH AS THOSE IN RESPECT OF ACCIDENTS AT WORK OR OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE , WHICH , BY VIRTUE OF THE NATIONAL RULES AGAINST THE OVERLAPPING OF BENEFITS , ORIGINALLY AFFECTED THE AMOUNT OF THE PENSION FIXED PURSUANT TO ARTICLE AND ANY SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS TO WHICH MIGHT AGAIN AFFECT THAT PENSION?   IN OTHER WORDS , IS IT NECESSARY TO RECALCULATE THE PENSION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE IN THE EVENT OF AN ADJUSTMENT BEING MADE TO THE AMOUNT OF A BENEFIT IN RESPECT OF OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE WHICH IS NOT AGGREGABLE OR IS PARTIALLY AGGREGABLE WITH THE PENSION?  ' '   IN ORDER TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IT IS NECESSARY TO INTERPRET ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1408/IN THE LIGHT OF ITS WORDING , CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES .   ARTICLE ( ) PROVIDES THAT IF , BY REASON OF AN INCREASE IN THE COST OF LIVING OR CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF WAGES OR SALARIES OR OTHER REASONS FOR ADJUSTMENT , THE BENEFITS OF THE STATES CONCERNED ARE ALTERED BY A FIXED PERCENTAGE OR     AMOUNT , SUCH PERCENTAGE OR AMOUNT MUST BE APPLIED DIRECTLY TO THE ' ' BENEFITS DETERMINED UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ' ' , WITHOUT THE NEED FOR A RECALCULATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THAT ARTICLE . ON THE OTHER HAND , ARTICLE ( ) PROVIDES THAT IF THE METHOD OF DETERMINING , OR THE RULES FOR CALCULATING , BENEFITS SHOULD BE ALTERED , A RECALCULATION IS TO BE CARRIED OUT . IN VIEW OF THE TERMS USED IN ARTICLE ( ) FOR THE REFERENCE TO ARTICLE , IT MUST BE OBSERVED THAT THE ONLY CASE COVERED EXPRESSLY BY ARTICLE IS THAT OF AN ALTERATION IN ONE OF THE BENEFITS WHICH HAVE BEEN DETERMINED UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE .    ARTICLE DETERMINES THE RULES GOVERNING THE AMOUNT OF BENEFITS FOR WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO THE LEGISLATION OF TWO OR MORE MEMBER STATES . IN PARTICULAR , IT SPECIFIES THE CALCULATIONS WHICH ARE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE APPLICATION OF THE NATIONAL LEGISLATION , INCLUDING ITS PROVISIONS AGAINST OVERLAPPING , IS MORE FAVOURABLE TO THE WORKER IN QUESTION THAN THE SYSTEM OF AGGREGATION AND APPORTIONMENT PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE ( ). IT FOLLOWS THAT THE CALCULATIONS MADE PURSUANT TO ARTICLE MAY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT NOT ONLY BENEFITS THE AMOUNT OF WHICH MUST BE DETERMINED ACCORDING TO THAT ARTICLE BUT ALSO , AS A RESULT OF THE NATIONAL RULES AGAINST OVERLAPPING , OTHER BENEFITS WHICH MAY SUBSEQUENTLY BE ALTERED .   IT MUST BE EMPHASIZED THAT ARTICLE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXCEPTION IN RELATION TO ARTICLE BUT A PROVISION GOVERNING ITS APPLICATION . THE FACT THAT A PARTICULAR SITUATION IS NOT EXPRESSLY COVERED BY SUCH A PROVISION DOES NOT PREVENT THE PROVISION FROM APPLYING TO IT IF THAT IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS OBJECTIVES .   AS THE COURT RECOGNIZED IN ITS JUDGMENT OF FEBRUARY ( CASE 7/, SINATRA V FONDS NATIONAL , ( ) ECR ), ARTICLE WAS INTENDED TO REDUCE THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN WHICH A FRESH EXAMINATION OF THE INSURED ' S SITUATION FOLLOWING EVERY ALTERATION IN THE BENEFITS RECEIVED WOULD ENTAIL . THE REGULATION WAS THUS INTENDED TO EXCLUDE A FRESH CALCULATION WHERE THE ALTERATION IN THE BENEFITS RESULTS FROM EVENTS UNCONNECTED WITH THE PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE INSURED AND IS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE GENERAL EVOLUTION OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SITUATION .   THE SAME GROUNDS OF SIMPLIFICATION AND STABILITY ARGUE AGAINST A RECALCULATION EACH TIME A BENEFIT WHICH INFLUENCED THE ORIGINAL CALCULATION OF BENEFITS , BY     VIRTUE OF THE NATIONAL RULES AGAINST OVERLAPPING , IS ALTERED AS A RESULT OF THE SAME GENERAL EVOLUTION . IN FACT , THE DISTINCTION MADE BY ARTICLE , DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE ALTERATION IN BENEFITS IS DUE TO THE GENERAL EVOLUTION IN THE ECONOMIC SITUATION OR TO AN ALTERATION IN THE METHOD OF DETERMINING THE BENEFITS OR IN THE RULES FOR CALCULATING THEM , IS JUST AS SUITABLE FOR APPLICATION TO BENEFITS OTHER THAN THOSE DETERMINED PURSUANT TO ARTICLE .    THEREFORE THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION MUST BE THAT ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1408/MUST BE INTERPRETED AS APPLYING TO BENEFITS SUCH AS THOSE IN RESPECT OF ACCIDENTS AT WORK OR OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE WHICH , BY VIRTUE OF THE NATIONAL RULES AGAINST THE OVERLAPPING OF BENEFITS , ORIGINALLY AFFECTED THE AMOUNT OF THE PENSION FIXED PURSUANT TO ARTICLE AND ANY SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS TO WHICH MIGHT AGAIN AFFECT THAT PENSION . IT IS THEREFORE NOT NECESSARY TO RECALCULATE THE PENSION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE IF AN ADJUSTMENT IS MADE TO SUCH A BENEFIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE GENERAL EVOLUTION OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SITUATION .
