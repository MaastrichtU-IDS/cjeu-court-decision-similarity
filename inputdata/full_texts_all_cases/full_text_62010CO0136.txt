Re:
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Curtea de Apel Târgu-Mureş – Registration of second-hand vehicles previously registered
                  in other Member States – Environmental tax levied on motor vehicles upon first registration in a Member State – Whether national
                  legislation is compatible with Articles 23, and EC – Possible derogation on the basis of Article EC.
               
Operative part
Article TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a Member State from introducing a pollution tax affecting motor vehicles
         on their first registration in that Member State, if that fiscal measure is so designed as to discourage the putting into
         service, in that Member State, of second-hand vehicles bought in other Member States, without, however, discouraging the purchase
         of second-hand vehicles of the same age and condition on the national market.
