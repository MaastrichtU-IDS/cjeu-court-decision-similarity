Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE APPLICANT IS ENTITLED TO AN EXPATRIATION ALLOWANCE ;  
Grounds
THE APPLICANT , WHO IS A BELGIAN NATIONAL , IS SEEKING THE ANNULMENT OF THE IMPLIED DECISION REJECTING HIS COMPLAINT , WHICH WAS REGISTERED ON OCTOBER , AND IN WHICH HE REQUESTED PAYMENT OF THE EXPATRIATION ALLOWANCE PROVIDED FOR BY THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS .   HE ALSO REQUESTS THAT THE COMMISSION BE ORDERED TO PAY HIM THE EXPATRIATION ALLOWANCE AS FROM JULY , THE DATE ON WHICH HE ENTERED THE SERVICE OF THE DEFENDANT AS A TEMPORARY SERVANT IN THE DANISH TRANSLATION SECTION , UNTIL JANUARY , WHEN HE WAS MADE A PROBATIONER .   HE MAINTAINS THAT , AS HE HAS HABITUALLY RESIDED OUTSIDE BELGIAN TERRITORY SINCE JULY , HE SATISFIES THE CONDITIONS LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE ( B ) OF ANNEX VII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS , AND , AS REGARDS HIS PARTICULAR CASE , IN ARTICLE OF THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OTHER SERVANTS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES .   THE PARTIES ARE AGREED ON THE FACT THAT FROM MAY TO JULY THE APPLICANT WAS ACTUALLY RESIDENT IN DENMARK .   ON THE OTHER HAND , THEY DO NOT AGREE IN RESPECT OF THE PERIOD FROM JULY TO MAY .    AS REGARDS , FIRST , THE PERIOD FROM JULY TO MAY , IT APPEARS FROM HIS FILE THAT THE APPLICANT VISITED DENMARK SEVERAL TIMES IN ORDER TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT WAS POSSIBLE TO ' SETTLE THERE PERMANENTLY ' .   HOWEVER , HE SPENT MORE THAN SIX MONTHS , THAT IS , APPROXIMATELY TWO-THIRDS OF THIS PERIOD , IN BELGIUM , OF WHICH PART WAS SPENT IN ANTWERP WHERE HE WAS EMPLOYED .   THIS PERIOD CANNOT BE DEEMED TO BE RESIDENCE OUTSIDE BELGIUM SOLELY ON THE GROUND THAT THE PERSON CONCERNED HAD THE INTENTION OF SETTLING SUBSEQUENTLY IN DENMARK , PARTICULARLY AS AT THAT TIME HE DID NOT EVEN CLAIM TO HAVE A PLACE OF RESIDENCE IN THAT COUNTRY .   SECONDLY , BY PERFORMING HIS MILITARY SERVICE IN THE BELGIAN ARMED FORCES , FIRST IN GERMANY FROM MAY TO SEPTEMBER AND THEN IN FRANCE WITH SHAPE FROM SEPTEMBER TO APRIL , THE APPLICANT WAS IN A POSITION COMPARABLE TO THAT OF A CONSCRIPT SERVING IN THE NATIONAL TERRITORY AND HE WAS PERFORMING DUTIES SIMILAR TO THOSE WHICH ARE DECLARED TO BE AN EXCEPTION TO THE ABOVEMENTIONED ARTICLE ( B ): ' DUTIES IN THE SERVICE OF A STATE OR OF AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION ' .   THEREFORE , DURING HIS MILITARY SERVICE THE APPLICANT CANNOT BE REGARDED AS HAVING BEEN RESIDENT OUTSIDE BELGIUM , THE COUNTRY IN WHICH HE WAS DOMICILED BEFORE THIS SERVICE .   AS THE APPLICANT HAS LIVED OUTSIDE THE STATE IN WHICH HE IS EMPLOYED FOR A PERIOD OF LESS THAN YEARS ENDING ON HIS ENTRY INTO THE SERVICE OF THE COMMUNITIES , THE APPLICATION MUST BE DISMISSED .
