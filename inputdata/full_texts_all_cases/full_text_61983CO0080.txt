THAT PROTOCOL PROVIDES THAT ONLY CERTAIN COURTS , REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE THEREOF , MAY REQUEST THE COURT OF JUSTICE TO GIVE PRELIMINARY RULINGS ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE BRUSSELS CONVENTION , SO THAT , IN THIS INSTANCE , IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE COURT OF JUSTICE HAS JURISDICTION TO REPLY TO THE QUESTION SUBMITTED TO IT .

' '  SINCE THE ITALIAN TRIBUNALI ( DISTRICT COURTS ) ARE NOT REFERRED TO EITHER IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THE PROTOCOL OR IN ARTICLE OF THE BRUSSELS CONVENTION , THEY MAY REQUEST THE COURT OF JUSTICE TO GIVE A PRELIMINARY RULING ON A QUESTION OF INTERPRETATION ONLY WHEN THEY ARE ' ' SITTING IN AN APPELLATE CAPACITY ' ' .  IT IS APPARENT FROM THE PAPERS IN THE CASE THAT THE ORDER REQUESTING A PRELIMINARY RULING WAS MADE IN THE COURSE OF PROCEEDINGS AT FIRST INSTANCE ON AN ACTION BROUGHT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE ITALIAN CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE AGAINST A PAYMENT ORDER MADE UNDER THE SUMMARY PROCEDURE PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLES ET SEQ . OF THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE . IT MUST THEREFORE BE STATED THAT THE ORDER OF THE NATIONAL COURT WAS NOT MADE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THE PROTOCOL ON THE INTERPRETATION BY THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE CONVENTION OF SEPTEMBER .   CONSEQUENTLY , IT IS CLEAR THAT THE COURT HAS NO JURISDICTION TO TAKE COGNIZANCE OF THE REFERENCE FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING WHICH MUST THEREFORE BE DECLARED INADMISSIBLE WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) TOGETHER WITH ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE .
