APPLICATION IN THE TERMS SET OUT IN THE APPLICANT ' S CONCLUSIONS , 
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON MAY , MARIO BERTI , AN OFFICIAL OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , BROUGHT AN ACTION SEEKING COMPENSATION FOR MATERIAL AND NON-MATERIAL DAMAGE AND DISFIGUREMENT RESULTING FROM AN ACCIDENT WHICH HIS SON PAULO SUSTAINED ON APRIL WHILE STAYING IN A HOLIDAY CAMP ORGANIZED BY THE COMMISSION FOR CHILDREN OF OFFICIALS .   ON OCTOBER THE COURT ( FIRST CHAMBER ), BEFORE GIVING FINAL JUDGMENT ON THE APPLICATION MADE BY MR BERTI , GAVE THE FOLLOWING INTERLOCUTORY DECISION ( REPORTED IN ( ) ECR ):    ' ( ) THE COMMISSION IS ORDERED TO COMPENSATE THE APPLICANT FOR ALL MATERIAL AND AESTHETIC INJURY SUSTAINED BY HIS SON PAULO AS A RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT ON APRIL .    ' ( 2)THE PARTIES ARE INVITED TO AGREE ON THE AMOUNT OF THE FINANCIAL COMPENSATION WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF THE DATE OF THIS JUDGMENT .   ' ( 3)IN DEFAULT OF SUCH AGREEMENT THE COURT WILL ITSELF DECIDE THE ISSUE .   ' ( 4)COSTS ARE RESERVED . '   BY ORDERS OF THE COURT ( FIRST CHAMBER ) OF APRIL AND DECEMBER THE TIME-LIMIT IMPOSED ON THE PARTIES IN THAT JUDGMENT WAS TWICE EXTENDED .   THE PARTIES AGREED TO APPOINT TWO MEDICAL EXPERTS , WHO WERE ASKED TO DETERMINE THE MATERIAL DAMAGE AND DISFIGUREMENT SUFFERED BY MR BERTI ' S SON .   THE TWO MEDICAL EXPERTS DREW UP A MEDICAL REPORT DATED JANUARY IN WHICH THEY AGREED THAT MR BERTI WAS ENTITLED TO THE FOLLOWING AMOUNTS BY WAY OF REIMBURSEMENT OF MEDICAL EXPENSES :       - BFR FOR THE FITTING OF A PROSTHESIS AND REPLACEMENTS THEREOF ,   - BFR FOR THE EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXTRACTION OF THE UPPER CANINE TOGETHER WITH RADIOGRAPHY ,   - BFR FOR THE FITTING OF A TEMPORARY PROSTHESIS ,   - BFR FOR TECHNICAL ALTERATIONS TO THE GUM OF THE PROSTHESIS AFTER FITTING .   THE PARTIES ACCEPTED THE ASSESSMENT OF THE MEDICAL EXPENSES CONTAINED IN THE REPORT AND THE COMMISSION PAID TO MR BERTI THE AMOUNTS REFERRED TO ABOVE .   IN ADDITION THE REPORT CONCLUDED THAT , AS A RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT SUSTAINED , MR BERTI ' S SON SUFFERED :   - PERMANENT PARTIAL INVALIDITY OF 1% OWING TO THE LOSS OF TEETH ;  - SLIGHT DISFIGUREMENT , ASSESSED AT ON A SCALE OF , OWING TO A SCAR ON THE LOWER LIP .   THE PARTIES WERE UNABLE TO AGREE ON THE COMPENSATION PAYABLE IN RESPECT OF THE PERMANENT PARTIAL INVALIDITY OF 1% AND THE SLIGHT DISFIGUREMENT . THE PARTIES ALSO DISAGREE AS TO WHETHER COMPENSATORY INTEREST OR INTEREST FOR LATE PAYMENT , OR BOTH , SHOULD BE AWARDED IN ADDITION TO THE COMPENSATION . THEY HAVE THEREFORE REQUESTED THE COURT TO DECIDE THE POINTS OUTSTANDING .  THE PERMANENT PARTIAL INVALIDITY   BY WAY OF COMPENSATION FOR THE PERMANENT PARTIAL INVALIDITY OF 1% SUFFERED BY MR BERTI ' S SON , THE COMMISSION OFFERED THE SUM OF BFR . IT STATES THAT THAT AMOUNT IS CONSIDERABLY GREATER THAN THE AMOUNTS NORMALLY AWARDED IN SIMILAR CASES BY THE BELGIAN COURTS .   MR BERTI CONSIDERS THE SUM OFFERED BY THE COMMISSION TO BE INADEQUATE . HE CLAIMS THAT THE COMPENSATION IN QUESTION SHOULD BE CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT GUARANTEED BY THE INSURANCE POLICY WHICH THE COMMISSION HAD TAKEN OUT WITH A PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANY TO COVER THE CIVIL LIABILITY ARISING OUT     OF ANY PHYSICAL INJURY WHICH MIGHT OCCUR IN THE HOLIDAY CAMP ORGANIZED FOR THE CHILDREN OF ITS OFFICIALS . FOR THE PERIOD COMMENCING ON FEBRUARY THAT MAXIMUM GUARANTEE WAS FIXED AT BFR . MR BERTI THEREFORE CLAIMS THAT THE COMPENSATION PAYABLE FOR THE PERMANENT PARTIAL INVALIDITY OF 1% SHOULD BE 1% OF THAT GUARANTEE , THAT IS TO SAY BFR .    AS THE COMMISSION HAS RIGHTLY CONTENDED , THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT GUARANTEED BY THE CONTRACT OF INSURANCE ENTERED INTO BY THE COMMISSION IS NOT RELEVANT TO THIS DISPUTE . IT CONSTITUTES THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT WHICH THE INSURANCE COMPANY HAS AGREED TO PAY BY WAY OF COMPENSATION FOR ANY PHYSICAL INJURY OCCURRING AS A RESULT OF AN ACCIDENT IN ANY OF THE COMMISSION ' S HOLIDAY CAMPS , EVEN IF THE ACCIDENT INVOLVED MORE THAN ONE PERSON .   IT FOLLOWS THAT THE COMPENSATION PAYABLE TO MR BERTI FOR THE PERMANENT PARTIAL INVALIDITY OF HIS SON CANNOT BE 1% OF THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT GUARANTEED BY THE CONTRACT OF INSURANCE ENTERED INTO BY THE COMMISSION .   THE APPLICANT HAS NOT PUT FORWARD ANY RELEVANT ARGUMENTS TO THE CONTRARY . IT MUST THEREFORE BE CONCLUDED THAT THE SUM OF BFR OFFERED BY THE COMMISSION CONSTITUTES FAIR COMPENSATION FOR THE PERMANENT PARTIAL INVALIDITY OF 1% SUFFERED BY MR BERTI ' S SON .  THE DISFIGUREMENT   IN RESPECT OF COMPENSATION FOR THE SLIGHT DISFIGUREMENT ESTABLISHED IN THE REPORT , THE COMMISSION OFFERS THE SUM OF BFR .    SINCE THAT AMOUNT WAS ACCEPTED BY MR BERTI ' S COUNSEL AT THE SITTING ON JANUARY , IT MUST BE REGARDED AS APPROPRIATE COMPENSATION FOR THE SLIGHT DISFIGUREMENT SUFFERED BY MR BERTI ' S SON .  COMPENSATORY INTEREST   MR BERTI CLAIMS THAT INTEREST SHOULD BE AWARDED ON THE AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION PAYABLE TO HIS SON IN RESPECT OF HIS PERMANENT PARTIAL INVALIDITY OF 1% TO COMPENSATE , FIRST , FOR THE FALL IN THE VALUE OF MONEY SINCE THE DATE OF THE ACCIDENT AND , SECONDLY , FOR THE LOSS OF INTEREST WHICH HE HAS INCURRED THROUGH NOT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO DEPOSIT THE MONEY IN A BANK .       THAT CLAIM WAS NOT SET OUT BY MR BERTI IN HIS APPLICATION . IT IS THEREFORE A NEW ISSUE , THE RAISING OF WHICH IN THE COURSE OF PROCEEDINGS IS IN PRINCIPLE PROHIBITED BY ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE .   CONSEQUENTLY , THE CLAIM SUBMITTED BY MR BERTI FOR COMPENSATORY INTEREST MUST BE DECLARED INADMISSIBLE .  DEFAULT INTEREST   MR BERTI CLAIMS INTEREST AT THE RATE PRESCRIBED BY THE RELEVANT BELGIAN LEGISLATION , THAT IS TO SAY 12% , FROM THE DATE OF THIS JUDGMENT , ON THE AMOUNT PAYABLE BY WAY OF COMPENSATION FOR THE PERMANENT PARTIAL INVALIDITY AND DISFIGUREMENT SUFFERED BY HIS SON .   AT THE SITTING ON JANUARY , THE COMMISSION ACCEDED TO THE CLAIM FOR INTEREST AND AGREED TO THE DATE FROM WHICH SUCH INTEREST SHOULD BE PAYABLE . IT RELIED ON THE WISDOM OF THE COURT TO DETERMINE THE RATE PAYABLE , ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT FORMALLY DISPUTE MR BERTI ' S CLAIM ON THAT POINT .   THE COMMISSION SHOULD THEREFORE BE ORDERED TO PAY TO MR BERTI INTEREST AT 12% ON THE COMPENSATION FOR PERMANENT PARTIAL INVALIDITY AND SLIGHT DISFIGUREMENT FROM THE DATE OF THIS JUDGMENT UNTIL THE AMOUNTS IN QUESTION HAVE BEEN PAID .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS , IF THEY HAVE BEEN ASKED FOR , IN THE SUCCESSFUL PARTY ' S PLEADINGS .   IN HIS APPLICATION MR BERTI CLAIMED THAT THE COMMISSION SHOULD BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .   SINCE THE COMMISSION HAS IN THE MAIN FAILED IN ITS SUBMISSIONS , IT MUST BE ORDERED TO PAY THE WHOLE OF THE COSTS , BOTH FOR THE PROCEEDINGS LEADING UP TO THE INTERLOCUTORY JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER AND FOR THE SUBSEQUENT PROCEEDINGS .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ( FIRST CHAMBER )   HEREBY :    ( ) ORDERS THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES TO PAY TO MR BERTI , IN HIS CAPACITY AS THE LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE OF HIS SON PAULO , THE SUM OF BFR BY WAY OF COMPENSATION FOR THE PERMANENT PARTIAL INVALIDITY AND SLIGHT DISFIGUREMENT SUFFERED BY HIS SON , TOGETHER WITH INTEREST AT THE RATE OF 12% FROM THE DATE OF THIS JUDGMENT .   ( 2)DISMISSES THE REMAINDER OF THE APPLICATION .   ( 3)ORDERS THE COMMISSION TO PAY THE WHOLE OF THE COSTS .
