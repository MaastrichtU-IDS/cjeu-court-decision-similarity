Re: 
Appeal lodged against the order of the General Court (Fourth Chamber) of February in Case T-3/Pérez Guerra 
v 
BNP Paribas and Spain
 by which that court dismissed, for manifest inadmissibility, an application for recognition of ownership of a pension fund
                  and a claim for receipt of the sums supposedly due on that basis.
               
Operative part 
1.
	The appeal is dismissed.
2.
	Mr Pérez Guerra is ordered to bear his own costs.
