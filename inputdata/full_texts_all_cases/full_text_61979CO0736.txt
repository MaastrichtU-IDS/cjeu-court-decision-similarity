Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON OCTOBER 1979, THE APPLICANTS, OFFICIALS OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, BROUGHT AN ACTION TO HAVE DECLARED INAPPLICABLE TO THEM COUNCIL REGULATION NO 3087/ADJUSTING THE WEIGHTING APPLICABLE TO THE REMUNERATION AND PENSIONS OF OFFICIALS AND OTHER SERVANTS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES EMPLOYED OR HAVING A HOME IN ITALY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L 369, P . ).  THE PRESENT APPLICATIONS FORM PART OF A GROUP OF PARALLEL APPLICATIONS ( CASES TO 780/) WHICH WERE RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY . IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DECIDED THAT CASE 737/BATTAGLIA WOULD BE TREATED AS A TEST CASE AND THAT THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE OTHER CASES WOULD BE STAYED .  THE COURT DELIVERED AN INTERIM JUDGMENT IN CASE 737/ON DECEMBER (*(( )) ECR ) AND A FINAL JUDGMENT ON JANUARY (*(( )) ECR ). IN THE LATTER JUDGMENT THE COURT ORDERED THE COMMISSION TO PAY THE COSTS AS IT HAD FAILED IN VIRTUALLY ALL ITS SUBMISSIONS .  BY ORDER OF JUNE THE COURT ( SECOND CHAMBER ) DECIDED TO JOIN CASES AND TO 780/FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE WRITTEN AND ORAL PROCEDURE AND THE JUDGMENT .  BY LETTER LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JANUARY 1987, THE COMMISSION CONFIRMED THAT IT HAD TREATED THE APPLICANTS IN THE PRESENT CASES IN THE SAME WAY AS THE APPLICANT IN THE TEST CASE ( CASE 737/BATTAGLIA ) BY PAYING THEM DEFAULT INTEREST AT THE RATE OF 6% IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COURT' S JUDGMENT OF JANUARY IN THE AFOREMENTIONED CASE (*(( )) ECR ). THE COMMISSION CONSIDERED THAT AS A RESULT THE APPLICATIONS NO LONGER HAD ANY PURPOSE AND ASKED THE COURT TO DECLARE, PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 69() OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, THAT THERE IS NO NEED TO GIVE A DECISION ON THE APPLICATIONS .  BY LETTER LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON FEBRUARY 1987, COUNSEL FOR THE APPLICANTS INFORMED THE COURT THAT HE COULD NOT DISCONTINUE THE PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE MANDATE RECEIVED FROM HIS CLIENTS HE HAD NO AUTHORITY TO DO SO . HE LEFT IT FOR THE COURT TO RULE AS IT THOUGHT FIT ON THE PROPOSAL THAT IT SHOULD DECLARE THAT THERE WAS NO NEED TO GIVE A DECISION ON THE APPLICATIONS . AS REGARDS THE COSTS, HE REQUESTED THE COURT TO ORDER THE COMMISSION TO PAY THEM, AS IT HAD DONE IN CASE 737/79, CITED ABOVE .  IT MUST BE OBSERVED THAT THE APPLICANTS HAVE NOT DISPUTED THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BY THE COMMISSION IN ITS ABOVEMENTIONED LETTER OF JANUARY OF THE MEASURES TAKEN BY IT WITH REGARD TO THEM . NOR HAVE THEY DENIED THAT, IN VIEW OF THOSE MEASURES, THE APPLICATIONS NO LONGER HAVE ANY PURPOSE . IT MUST THEREFORE BE FOUND THAT THE APPLICATIONS NO LONGER HAVE ANY PURPOSE AND THAT THERE IS NO NEED TO GIVE A DECISION ON THEM .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  UNDER ARTICLE 69*() OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, WHERE A CASE DOES NOT PROCEED TO JUDGMENT THE COSTS ARE TO BE AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COURT . IN THE PRESENT CASE THE DECISION ON COSTS MUST FOLLOW THE COURT' S DECISION IN THAT MATTER IN THE TEST CASE 737/BATTAGLIA, CITED ABOVE . THE COMMISSION MUST THEREFORE BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS NECESSARILY INCURRED BY THE APPLICANTS .  
Operative part
On those grounds,  THE COURT ( Second Chamber )  hereby orders :  ( ) There is no need to give a decision;  ( ) The Commission shall bear the costs .  Luxembourg, June .
