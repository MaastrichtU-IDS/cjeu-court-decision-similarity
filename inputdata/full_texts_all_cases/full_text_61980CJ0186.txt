Summary
. THE RULES ON INSURANCE AGAINST THE RISK OF ACCIDENT AND OF OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE MADE PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS PROVIDE NO RIGHT OF OBJECTION TO THE APPOINTMENT OF DOCTORS TO THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE .   THAT IS BECAUSE , AS FAR AS THE OFFICIAL IS CONCERNED , HIS INTERESTS ARE SAFEGUARDED BY THE PRESENCE ON THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE OF A MEMBER  ENJOYING HIS CONFIDENCE AND BY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE THIRD MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE BY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE DOCTOR ENJOYING THE CONFIDENCE OF THE OFFICIAL AND THE MEMBER APPOINTED BY THE INSTITUTION . THE INSTITUTION CANNOT THEREFORE BE DENIED THE FREEDOM TO APPOINT THE DOCTOR WHOM IT CHOSE TO GIVE THE OPINION ON THE BASIS OF WHICH IT WAS TO DETERMINE THE DEGREE OF INVALIDITY OF THE OFFICIAL AND      WHO IN THAT CAPACITY HAD ALREADY BEEN CONCERNED WITH HIS HEALTH EVEN THOUGH SUCH DOCTOR IS ALSO APPROVED BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY .    . IT FOLLOWS FROM THE RULES ON INSURANCE AGAINST THE RISK OF ACCIDENT AND OF OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE THAT ENTITLEMENT TO PAYMENT OF THE INVALIDITY ALLOWANCE DOES NOT ARISE AS AND WHEN EACH OF THE INJURIES HAS CONSOLIDATD BUT ONLY WHEN THE INJURIES HAVE CONSOLIDATED AND FOR THAT VERY  REASON THE RULES GIVE A RIGHT TO A PROVISIONAL ALLOWANCE .   . UNDER THE INSURANCE PROVIDED FOR BY THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS THE COMPENSATION PAYABLE IN THE EVENT OF INVALIDITY IS IN THE NATURE OF A FLAT-RATE AWARD ASSESSED ON THE BASIS OF THE LASTING EFFECTS OF AN ACCIDENT . INTEREST MAY THUS BE CLAIMED ONLY WHERE THE PERSON ENTITLED TO THAT AWARD IS ABLE TO ESTABLISH THAT PAYMENT THEREOF WAS IMPROPERLY DELAYED BY THE AD-  MINISTRATION .

Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT DR M . CANNOT BE THE DOCTOR APPOINTED BY THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY TO BE A MEMBER OF THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE ESTABLISHED BY ARTICLE OF THE RULES ON THE INSURANCE OF OFFICIALS AGAINST THE RISK OF ACCIDENT AND OF OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE , CHARGING THE COMMISSION IN ADDITION WITH DELAY IN THE AWARD OF THE INCAPACITY ALLOWANCE AND THEREFORE CLAIMING DEFAULT INTEREST ; AND FURTHER CLAIMING , IN THE REPLY , A DECLARATION IN RESPECT OF THE METHOD OF PAYMENT OF THE FEES OF THE MEMBERS OF THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE AND THAT THE OPINION OF THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE SHOULD BE FORWARDED TO THE APPLICANT , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON SEPTEMBER BENOIT SUSS , A RETIRED OFFICIAL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , BROUGHT AN ACTION CLAIMING ON THE ONE HAND A DECLARATION THAT THE DOCTOR APPOINTED BY THE COMMISSION CANNOT BE A MEMBER OF THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE ESTABLISHED UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES , ADOPTED UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , ON THE INSURANCE OF OFFICIALS AGAINST THE RISK OF ACCIDENT , ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' ' THE RULES ' ' ), FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING THE DEGREE OF THE APPLICANT ' S PERMANENT INVALIDITY , AND ON THE OTHER HAND CHARGING THE COMMISSION WITH DELAY IN AWARDING THE INVALIDITY ALLOWANCE AND THUS CLAIMING DEFAULT INTEREST . IN THE REPLY THE APPLICANT ' S FURTHER CLAIMS COVERED THE METHOD OF PAYMENT OF THE FEES OF THE MEMBERS OF THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE AND THE PRODUCTION TO HIM OF THE OPINION OF THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE IN RELATION TO HIS RETIREMENT .   THE APPLICANT , WHO WAS THE SUBJECT OF AN ASSAULT IN MAY AND WAS PLACED ON INVALIDITY PENSION AS FROM DECEMBER , WAS EXAMINED IN JUNE BY THE DOCTOR APPOINTED BY THE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE RULES IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE ASSAULT . THAT DOCTOR WAS ALSO APPROVED BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY WITH WHICH THE COMMISSION COLLECTIVELY INSURED ITS STAFF . BECAUSE THE INJURIES HAD NOT CONSOLIDATED THE SAID DOCTOR DECIDED TO RE-EXAMINE THE APPLICANT A YEAR LATER AND ASKED THE PRACTITIONER WHO HAD EXAMINED HIM WHILE IN HOSPITAL TO MAKE AN ADDITIONAL EXAMINATION . THE REPORT OF THAT EXAMINATION WAS NOT FORWARDED UNTIL APRIL . IN NOVEMBER THE APPLICANT ASKED FOR A PROVISIONAL ALLOWANCE PURSUANT TO THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE RULES .   AFTER RECEIVING THE MEDICAL CERTIFICATES IN RELATION TO THE VARIOUS INJURIES THE DOCTOR APPOINTED BY THE COMMISSION RE-EXAMINED THE APPLICANT ON MAY AND ASSESSED THE TOTAL PERMANENT PARTIAL INVALIDITY AT 34% WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY INCREASED TO 37% . ON THAT BASIS THE COMMISSION MADE A DRAFT DECISION WHICH WAS FORWARDED TO THE APPLICANT IN JULY PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE RULES . THE APPLICANT OBJECTED TO THAT DRAFT AND REQUESTED AN OPINION FROM THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE AS PROVIDED BY ARTICLE AND THE     COMMISSION THEN APPOINTED THE DOCTOR WHOM IT HAD ALREADY APPOINTED UNDER ARTICLE , TO BE A MEMBER OF THAT COMMITTEE . THE COMMISSION WROTE TO THE DOCTOR APPOINTED BY THE APPLICANT SAYING THAT THE COMMISSION ' S DOCTOR WOULD INFORM HIM OF THE PROCEDURE TO BE FOLLOWED FOR THE PAYMENT OF HIS FEES .   IN NOVEMBER THE COMMISSION PAID THE APPLICANT A PROVISIONAL ALLOWANCE CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF A RATE OF 25% . AFTER THE PRESENT ACTION WAS BROUGHT THE COMMISSION PAID HIM AN ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCE OF 12% , WHICH BROUGHT THE PROVISIONAL ALLOWANCE TO THE SAME AMOUNT AS THAT PROPOSED TO THE APPLICANT IN THE DRAFT DECISION .   DURING THE COURSE OF THE WRITTEN PROCEDURE THE APPLICANT MADE AN APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES WITH A VIEW TO THE REPLACEMENT OF THE DOCTOR APPOINTED BY THE COMMISSION . BY ORDER OF NOVEMBER THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECOND CHAMBER OF THE COURT DISMISSED THAT APPLICATION ON THE TWOFOLD GROUND THAT THE APPLICANT HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN PROVING THAT THERE WAS ANY IMPENDING DAMAGE AND THAT THERE WAS NO URGENT REQUIREMENT FOR ACTION TO BE TAKEN AT THAT STAGE BECAUSE THE APPLICANT WOULD BE ABLE TO BRING AN ACTION AGAINST ANY DECISION TAKEN BY THE INSTITUTION ON THE BASIS OF THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE ' S REPORT . THE APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES ALSO ASKED FOR THE OPINION OF THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE TO BE FORWARDED TO THE APPLICANT . THE ORDER DISMISSED THAT CLAIM AS BEING IRRELEVANT TO THE PRESENT CASE .  THE COMPOSITION OF THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE   THE APPLICANT CLAIMS THAT THE DOCTOR APPOINTED BY THE COMMISSION SHOULD BE EXCLUDED AS A MEMBER OF THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE ON THE GROUND THAT HIS APPOINTMENT IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF THE PROTECTION OF LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION AND CONTRARY TO THE IMPARTIALITY OF THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE ON THE DOUBLE GROUND THAT IT WAS HE WHO DRAFTED THE REPORT CHALLENGED BY THE APPLICANT AND THAT HE IS THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF , OR , AT LEAST , THE DOCTOR APPROVED BY , THE INSURANCE COMPANY . ON THE LATTER ISSUE THE COMMISSION EXPLAINED THAT IT HAD REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANY AS TO THE LIST OF DOCTORS TO WHOM THE EXAMINATIONS PROVIDED FOR BY THE RULES MIGHT BE ENTRUSTED .       THE RULES MADE PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS DETERMINE THE CONDITIONS GOVERNING CASES WHICH MAY ARISE IN APPLYING THE SCHEME OF INSURANCE AGAINST THE RISK OF ACCIDENT AND OF OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE AS FOLLOWS :    ' ' ARTICLE DECISIONS RECOGNIZING THE ACCIDENTAL CAUSE OF AN OCCURRENCE INCLUDING A DECISION AS TO WHETHER THE OCCURRENCE IS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO OCCUPATIONAL OR NON-OCCUPATIONAL RISKS , OR DECISIONS RECOGNIZING THE OCCUPATIONAL NATURE OF A DISEASE AND ASSESSING THE DEGREE OF PERMANENT INVALIDITY SHALL BE TAKEN BY THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURE LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE :   - ON THE BASIS OF FINDINGS OF THE DOCTOR(S ) APPOINTED BY THE INSTITUTIONS ; AND  - WHERE THE OFFICIAL SO REQUESTS , AFTER CONSULTING THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE .    ARTICLE ( )   THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE SHALL CONSIST OF THREE DOCTORS :   - ONE APPOINTED BY THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY ;  - ONE APPOINTED BY THE OFFICIAL CONCERNED OR THOSE ENTITLED UNDER HIM ;  - ONE APPOINTED BY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FIRST TWO DOCTORS .   WHERE AGREEMENT CANNOT BE REACHED ON THE APPOINTMENT OF THE THIRD DOCTOR WITHIN A PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS FOLLOWING APPOINTMENT OF THE SECOND DOCTOR , THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES SHALL APPOINT THE THIRD DOCTOR AT THE REQUEST OF EITHER PARTY .  ON COMPLETING ITS PROCEEDING , THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE SHALL SET OUT ITS OPINION IN A REPORT TO BE COMMUNICATED TO THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY AND TO THE OFFICIAL OR THOSE ENTITLED UNDER HIM . ' '       AS THE COURT HAS ALREADY STRESSED IN ITS JUDGMENT OF MAY ( CASE 156/, MORBELLI ( ) ECR ) THE RULES ARE INTENDED TO ALLOW OFFICIALS TO BE EXAMINED TWICE , FIRST BY DOCTORS ENJOYING THE CONFIDENCE OF THE INSTITUTION AND , IN THE EVENT OF DISAGREEMENT , BY A MEDICAL COMMITTEE TO WHICH BOTH PARTIES APPOINT A DOCTOR ENJOYING THEIR CONFIDENCE .   THE RULES PROVIDE NO RIGHT OF OBJECTION TO AN APPOINTMENT BECAUSE AS FAR AS OFFICIALS ARE CONCERNED THEIR INTERESTS ARE SAFEGUARDED BY THE PRESENCE ON THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE OF A MEMBER ENJOYING THEIR CONFIDENCE AND BY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE THIRD MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE BY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE DOCTOR ENJOYING THE CONFIDENCE OF THE OFFICIAL AND THE MEMBER APPOINTED BY THE INSTITUTION .   FOR THE SAME REASON THE INSTITUTION CANNOT BE DENIED THE FREEDOM TO APPOINT THE DOCTOR WHOM IT DESIGNATED PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE RULES AND WHO , AS SUCH , HAS ALREADY BEEN CONCERNED WITH THE STATE OF HEALTH OF THE OFFICIAL . IN THE SAME WAY MOREOVER THERE IS NOTHING TO PREVENT THE OFFICIAL FROM APPOINTING A DOCTOR WHO HAS ALREADY AT THE OFFICIAL ' S REQUEST ISSUED CERTIFICATES IN RELATION TO THE DISABILITY IN QUESTION .   FURTHER , IT IS NECESSARY TO STRESS THAT THE APPOINTMENT BY THE COMMISSION OF A MEDICAL OFFICER WHO IS ALSO APPROVED BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY , WHILST BEING IN THE INTERESTS OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND THE COMMISSION , CAN IN NO WAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE INTERESTS OF THE OFFICIAL .   IT FOLLOWS FROM ALL THOSE CONSIDERATIONS THAT THE APPLICANT ' S CLAIM IN RESPECT OF THE COMPOSITION OF THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE MUST BE REJECTED .  THE CLAIM FOR DEFAULT INTEREST   THE APPLICANT CLAIMS THAT INTEREST CALCULATED AS FROM THE CONSOLIDATION OF EACH OF THE INJURIES SHOULD BE PAID ON THE ALLOWANCE . IN THAT RESPECT HE ALLEGES THAT THE COURSE OF THE PROCEDURE DETERMINING THE RATE OF PERMANENT PARTIAL INVALIDITY HAS BEEN UNDULY LONG AND THAT THE COMMISSION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS BECAUSE OF THE CONDUCT OF THE DOCTOR WHOM IT APPOINTED . HE OUGHT TO HAVE PURSUED THE CASE SO AS TO BE ABLE TO     DETERMINE THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE VARIOUS INJURIES AS AND WHEN IT OCCURRED . ON THE CONTRARY THE DOCTOR DECIDED TO POSTPONE HIS FINAL EXAMINATION TO THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND DELEGATED SPECIALIST EXAMINATIONS TO ANOTHER DOCTOR WHO , IT IS ALLEGED , MADE HIS REPORT AFTER CONSIDERABLE DELAY . IT IS ALSO CLAIMED THAT THE WAY IN WHICH THE CASE WAS PURSUED WAS ALSO OPEN TO CRITICISM INASMUCH AS THE APPLICANT HAD TO GO TO DOCTORS NOMINATED BY THE DOCTOR APPOINTED BY THE COMMISSION AND THOSE EXAMINATIONS WERE INCOMPLETE , THUS FORCING THE APPLICANT TO ARRANGE AT A LATER DATE FOR FURTHER EXAMINATIONS ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT .   IT SHOULD BE STRESSED FIRST OF ALL THAT ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF THE RULES IN QUESTION ' ' THE DECISION DEFINING THE DEGREE OF INVALIDITY SHALL BE TAKEN AFTER THE OFFICIAL ' S INJURIES HAVE CONSOLIDATED ' ' , AND THE SECOND PARAGRAPH THEREOF PROVIDES THAT ' ' WHERE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFINE THE DEGREE OF INVALIDITY AFTER MEDICAL TREATMENT IS TERMINATED , THE FINDINGS OF THE DOCTOR(S ) REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE OR , WHERE APPROPRIATE , THE REPORT OF THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE MUST SPECIFY A DEADLINE FOR REVIEWING THE OFFICIAL ' S CASE . ' '   IT FOLLOWS FROM THOSE PROVISIONS THAT ENTITLEMENT TO PAYMENT OF THE INVALIDITY ALLOWANCE DOES NOT ARISE AS AND WHEN EACH OF THE INJURIES HAS CONSOLIDATED BUT ONLY WHEN ALL THE INJURIES HAVE CONSOLIDATED . IT IS FOR THAT VERY REASON THAT THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF THE AFORESAID ARTICLE GIVES A RIGHT TO A PROVISIONAL ALLOWANCE .   IT IS FURTHER APPROPRIATE TO RECALL THAT UNDER THE INSURANCE PROVIDED FOR BY THE STAFF REGULATIONS THE COMPENSATION PAYABLE IN THE EVENT OF INVALIDITY IS IN THE NATURE OF A FLAT-RATE AWARD ASSESSED ON THE BASIS OF THE LASTING EFFECTS OF AN ACCIDENT . INTEREST MAY THUS BE CLAIMED ONLY WHERE THE PERSON ENTITLED TO THAT AWARD IS ABLE TO ESTABLISH THAT PAYMENT THEREOF WAS IMPROPERLY DELAYED BY THE ADMINISTRATION .   THAT IS NOT SO IN THE PRESENT CASE . THE MEDICAL CERTIFICATES PRODUCED REVEAL THE CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING THE DATE WHEN THE APPLICANT ' S INJURIES CONSOLIDATED AND THEREFORE JUSTIFY THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION ' S MEDICAL OFFICER TO RE-EXAMINE THE APPLICANT A YEAR AFTER THE FIRST EXAMINATION .     MOREOVER , THE APPLICANT DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE CHALLENGED THAT DECISION AT THE TIME . THE REPORT SOUGHT FROM THE DOCTOR WHO HAD EXAMINED THE APPLICANT WHEN HE WAS IN HOSPITAL WAS RECEIVED BY THE COMMISSION ' S MEDICAL OFFICER BEFORE THE EXPIRY OF THAT PERIOD OF ONE YEAR . AFTER RE-EXAMINING THE APPLICANT THE DOCTOR GAVE HIS FINAL REPORT TO THE COMMISSION WHICH , ALSO WITHOUT DELAY , ADOPTED A DRAFT DECISION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE RULES .   THE COURT MUST , THEREFORE , FIND THAT THE CLAIM FOR INTEREST MUST ALSO BE DISMISSED .  ADDITIONAL CLAIMS MADE IN THE REPLY   THE CLAIM FOR PRODUCTION OF THE OPINION OF THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE RELATES , ACCORDING TO THE EXPLANATIONS GIVEN , NOT TO THE OPINION PROPERLY SO CALLED , WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN FORWARDED TO THE APPLICANT , BUT TO THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE AS A WHOLE . IT IS ALSO APPARENT FROM THE FILE THAT THE REPORT IS AVAILABLE TO THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE AND THAT THE REASON FOR THE CLAIM IS THE APPLICANT ' S WISH TO BE IN A POSITION TO CHALLENGE , IF NECESSARY BY LEGAL ACTION , HIS RETIREMENT ON INVALIDITY PENSION . HAVING REGARD TO THE DELAY IN MAKING THAT CLAIM AND THE FACT THAT IT HAS NO CONNEXION WITH THE OTHER CLAIMS IN THE PRESENT ACTION IT MUST BE DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE .   AS REGARDS THE CLAIM IN RELATION TO THE FEES OF THE MEMBERS OF THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE , THE APPLICANT DESCRIBES THE LETTER IN WHICH THE COMMISSION INVITED THE APPLICANT ' S DOCTOR TO APPLY FOR SETTLEMENT OF HIS FEES TO THE DOCTOR APPOINTED BY THE COMMISSION WHO WAS AT THE SAME TIME THE INSURERS '  MEDICAL OFFICER , AS ' ' INTOLERABLY AMBIGUOUS ' ' . IN WRITING THIS LETTER , IT IS SAID , THE COMMISSION GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS FOR THE INSURERS TO SETTLE THE FEES . THE COMMISSION OUGHT THEREFORE TO HAVE NAMED ITS OWN DEPARTMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYMENT .   EVEN IF THAT CLAIM HAD NOT BEEN LATE IT WOULD IN ANY EVENT HAVE LOST ITS PURPOSE AFTER THE COMMISSION ' S REJOINDER IN WHICH IT CLEARLY SHOWED THAT THE INSTITUTION PAYS THE FEES DIRECTLY .  
Decision on costs
UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .   SAVE ON ONE ISSUE , SETTLED BY THE COMMISSION IN THE COURSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS BY AN ADDITIONAL PROVISIONAL PAYMENT OF 12% , THE APPLICANT HAS FAILED IN ALL HIS SUBMISSIONS .   HOWEVER , UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE INSTITUTIONS ARE TO BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS IN PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ( SECOND CHAMBER )   HEREBY :   . DISMISSES THE APPLICATION ;  . ORDERS THE PARTIES TO BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .
