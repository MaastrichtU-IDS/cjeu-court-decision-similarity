Summary
. THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY HAS A WIDE DISCRETION IN EVALUATING THE INTERESTS OF THE SERVICE AND THE MERITS TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN THE CONTEXT OF A DECISION ON PROMOTION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND IN REGARD TO SUCH MATTERS THE COURT MUST CONFINE ITSELF TO THE QUESTION WHETHER THE ADMINISTRATION KEPT WITHIN PROPER BOUNDS AND DID NOT EXERCISE ITS POWERS IN A MANIFESTLY ERRONEOUS MANNER .   . IN THE CASE OF PROMOTION , FACTORS OTHER THAN DIPLOMAS MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN THE MERITS OF OFFICIALS ELIGIBLE FOR PROMOTION ARE COMPARED , IN PARTICULAR THE GENERAL STANDARD OF THE WORK WHICH THEY HAVE PERFORMED IN CARRYING OUT THEIR DUTIES .     CONSEQUENTLY AN OFFICIAL CANNOT COMPLAIN THAT , IN THE EXERCISE OF ITS       DISCRETION , THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY DID NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SOLELY THE CANDIDATES '  DIPLOMAS AND CHOSE TO PROMOTE A PERSON WHOSE DIPLOMAS WERE OF A LOWER LEVEL THAN HIS .   . FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROMOTION , SENIORITY IS MERELY ONE OF A NUMBER OF CRITERIA OF ASSESSMENT AND IT CAN NEVER TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER THE MERITS OF CANDIDATES .

APPLICATION IN THE TERMS SET OUT IN THE APPLICANT ' S CONCLUSIONS , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JANUARY , LENE OEHRGAARD AND JEAN-LOUIS DELVAUX , BOTH OFFICIALS IN GRADE L/A IN THE DANISH TRANSLATION DIVISION OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , BROUGHT AN ACTION , FIRST , FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION , NOTIFIED BY LETTER DATED APRIL , REJECTING THEIR CANDIDATURES FOR POSTS OF PRINCIPAL TRANSLATOR IN GRADE L/A SUBMITTED PURSUANT TO VACANCY NOTICE COM/1134-1140/AND , SECONDLY , FOR AN ORDER COMPELLING THE COMMISSION TO APPOINT THEM TO SUCH POSTS EITHER BY MEANS OF THE CREATION OF TWO NEW POSTS OF PRINCIPAL TRANSLATOR OR OF THE ANNULMENT OF THE APPOINTMENT OF TWO OFFICIALS WHO WERE APPOINTED AND WHOSE QUALIFICATIONS THEY CHALLENGE .   IN THE ABOVE-MENTIONED VACANCY NOTICE COM/1134-1140/THE ' ' QUALIFICATIONS REQUIRED ' '  INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING :    ' ' UNIVERSITY EDUCATION ATTESTED BY A DIPLOMA , OR EQUIVALENT PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE ;  LONG EXPERIENCE OF TRANSLATION ; EXPERIENCE OF REVISION ;  PROVEN ACTIVE COMMAND OF LANGUAGE WITH A SOUND STYLE ' ' .       IT IS NOT DISPUTED THAT THE APPLICANTS FULFILLED THE CONDITIONS FOR PROMOTION TO GRADE L/A . HOWEVER THEY WERE NOT SELECTED AND ON MARCH THE COMMISSION APPOINTED THE TWO OFFICIALS WHOSE APPOINTMENTS HAVE BEEN CONTESTED .   THE APPLICANTS SUBMITTED COMPLAINTS TO THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND SUBSEQUENTLY BROUGHT THIS ACTION WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY BASED ON TWO PRINCIPAL SUBMISSIONS . THE FIRST IS THAT THE TWO OFFICIALS PROMOTED BY THE COMMISSION DO NOT FULFILL ALL THE CONDITIONS SET OUT IN THE VACANCY NOTICE AND THAT BY APPOINTING THEM THE COMMISSION WAS GUILTY OF A MANIFEST ERROR . THE SECOND IS THAT THE POSTS IN QUESTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE APPLICANTS , PRIMARILY ON THE GROUND THAT THEY POSSESS BETTER QUALIFICATIONS .   IN THEIR REPLY THE APPLICANTS FURTHER CLAIM THAT THE COMMISSION HAS MISUSED ITS POWERS AS IS SHOWN BY NEW INFORMATION PRODUCED BY THE COMMISSION IN ITS DEFENCE .   THE COMMISSION MAINTAINS THAT THE LATTER SUBMISSION SHOULD BE REJECTED AS INADMISSIBLE UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE . HOWEVER , BEFORE EXAMINING THE COMMISSION ' S OBJECTION THAT THAT THIRD SUBMISSION WAS RAISED AT TOO LATE A STAGE , THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS SHOULD BE MADE ON THE FIRST TWO SUBMISSIONS .  THE FIRST SUBMISSION   THE APPLICANTS BASE THEIR FIRST SUBMISSION ESSENTIALLY ON THE FACT THAT IN THEIR VIEW , SINCE PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE CAN BE COUNTED ONLY AFTER THE REQUISITE DIPLOMA IS OBTAINED , THE TWO MAIN CONDITIONS IN THE VACANCY NOTICE , NAMELY A UNIVERSITY DEGREE AND PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE , ARE CUMULATIVE . THEY SUBMIT THAT IN THIS INSTANCE NEITHER OF THE TWO PERSONS PROMOTED FULFILLED THE TWO CONDITIONS . ONE DID NOT HAVE A UNIVERSITY DEGREE AND THEREFORE COULD NOT HAVE ANY PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE EITHER WHILE THE OTHER OBTAINED HIS UNIVERSITY DEGREE ONLY IN AND THUS HAD ONLY TWO YEARS '  SENIORITY WHEN HE WAS PROMOTED , WHICH CANNOT CONSTITUTE ' ' LONG EXPERIENCE ' ' .       AS THE COMMISSION HAS RIGHTLY OBSERVED , THE VACANCY NOTICE , BY USING THE WORD ' ' OR ' ' , CLEARLY INDICATES THAT THE CONDITIONS ARE ALTERNATIVE . IT IS THUS NECESSARY , BUT IT IS ALSO ENOUGH , TO POSSESS EITHER A UNIVERSITY DEGREE OR EQUIVALENT PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE AND THIS ALSO FOLLOWS FROM ARTICLE ( ) AND ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS ACCORDING TO WHICH , INTER ALIA , THE DUTIES OF STAFF IN THE CATEGORY L/A ' ' REQUIRE UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OR EQUIVALENT PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE ' ' .   IT IS SUFFICIENT TO NOTE IN THIS RESPECT THAT THE TWO OFFICIALS IN QUESTION PASSED A COMPETITION HELD IN TO ENTER THE SERVICE OF THE COMMUNITIES AND THAT THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY HAD AT THAT TIME CONSIDERED THAT THEY POSSESSED EQUIVALENT PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE ; BOTH OFFICIALS THEREFORE UNDENIABLY SATISFY THE FIRST CONDITION IN THE VACANCY NOTICE .   IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES , THE TWO OFFICIALS , WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING AS TRANSLATORS FOR THE COMMISSION SINCE , UNDENIABLY POSSESS LONG EXPERIENCE OF TRANSLATION AND THUS ALSO FULFIL THE SECOND REQUIREMENT IN THE VACANCY NOTICE .   THE FIRST SUBMISSION MUST THEREFORE BE REJECTED .  THE SECOND SUBMISSION   THE APPLICANTS SUBMIT THAT EVEN IF IT IS ACCEPTED THAT THE TWO OFFICIALS WHOSE APPOINTMENT THEY DISPUTE HAD THE QUALIFICATIONS REQUIRED IN THE VACANCY NOTICE , THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY SHOULD NEVERTHELESS HAVE APPOINTED THE APPLICANTS NOT ONLY BECAUSE THEY SATISFY ALL THE CONDITIONS REQUIRED BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE COMMISSION COMMITTED A MANIFEST ERROR IN NOT APPOINTING THEM SINCE , PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THEIR UNIVERSITY EDUCATION , THEY WERE BETTER QUALIFIED THAN THE TWO PERSONS WHO WERE PROMOTED .   THE COMMISSION REJECTS THE APPLICANTS '  ARGUMENTS WHICH , IT CLAIMS , ARE IN CONTRADICTION WITH ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS UNDER WHICH PROMOTION IS TO BE EFFECTED AFTER CONSIDERATION OF THE COMPARATIVE MERITS OF THE CANDIDATES AND NOT MERELY ON THE BASIS OF UNIVERSITY QUALIFICATIONS .       SINCE WHAT IS AT ISSUE IS A DECISION ON PROMOTION , IT SHOULD FIRST BE POINTED OUT THAT THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY HAS A WIDE DISCRETION IN EVALUATING THE INTERESTS OF THE SERVICE AND THE MERITS TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN THE CONTEXT OF A DECISION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND THAT IN REGARD TO THOSE MATTERS THE COURT MUST CONFINE ITSELF TO THE QUESTION WHETHER THE ADMINISTRATION KEPT WITHIN PROPER BOUNDS AND DID NOT EXERCISE ITS POWER IN A MANIFESTLY ERRONEOUS MANNER .   IN THIS CASE THERE IS NOTHING IN THE DOCUMENTS BEFORE THE COURT TO SHOW THAT THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY FAILED TO MAKE A PROPER ASSESSMENT OF THE QUALIFICATIONS AND MERITS OF THE VARIOUS CANDIDATES , INCLUDING THOSE OF THE APPLICANTS .   REGARDING IN PARTICULAR THE QUESTION OF THE DIPLOMAS REFERRED TO BY THE APPLICANTS , IT SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND THAT AS THE COURT STATED IN ITS JUDGMENT OF MARCH ( CASE 280/HOFFMANN V COMMISSION ( ) ECR ) IN THE CASE OF PROMOTION OTHER FACTORS MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN THE MERITS OF OFFICIALS ELIGIBLE FOR PROMOTION ARE COMPARED , IN PARTICULAR THE GENERAL STANDARD OF THE WORK WHICH THEY HAVE PERFORMED IN CARRYING OUT THEIR DUTIES .   CONSEQUENTLY THE APPLICANTS CANNOT COMPLAIN THAT , IN THE EXERCISE OF ITS DISCRETION , THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY DID NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SOLELY THE CANDIDATES '  DIPLOMAS AND CHOSE TO PROMOTE TWO PERSONS WHOSE DIPLOMAS WERE OF A LOWER LEVEL THAN THOSE OF THE APPLICANTS .   THE APPLICANTS HAVE FURTHER SUBMITTED THAT THE LEAVE ON PERSONAL GROUNDS GRANTED TO THEM FOR THE PERIOD FROM JANUARY TO JULY IN FACT PREVENTED THEM FROM BEING PROMOTED BY INTERRUPTING THEIR SENIORITY ALTHOUGH THE LEAVE WAS GRANTED TO THEM IN THE INTERESTS OF THE SERVICE .   IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE OBSERVED , ON THE ONE HAND , THAT SENIORITY IS MERELY ONE OF A NUMBER OF CRITERIA OF ASSESSMENT AND CAN NEVER TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER THE MERITS OF CANDIDATES AND , ON THE OTHER HAND , THAT ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS STATES THAT DURING LEAVE ON PERSONAL GROUNDS ' ' AN OFFICIAL SHALL NOT BE ENTITLED TO ADVANCEMENT TO A HIGHER STEP OR PROMOTION IN GRADE ' ' . ACCORDINGLY THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY CANNOT BE CRITICIZED FOR HAVING REGARDED THE APPLICANTS '  SENIORITY AS INTERRUPTED DURING     THE PERIOD OF THEIR LEAVE . FURTHERMORE THERE IS NOTHING IN THE DOCUMENTS BEFORE THE COURT TO SHOW THAT SENIORITY WAS A DECISIVE FACTOR IN THE APPOINTMENTS AT ISSUE .   SINCE THE APPLICANTS HAVE PRODUCED NO OTHER EVIDENCE THAT THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY EXCEEDED ITS DISCRETION BY GIVING ITS PREFERENCE TO OTHER CANDIDATES IN THE MATTER OF PROMOTION , THE SECOND SUBMISSION MUST ALSO BE REJECTED .   IT FOLLOWS THAT THE SUBMISSION OF MISUSE OF POWERS IS UNFOUNDED AND MUST ALSO BE REJECTED .   CONSEQUENTLY THE APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT OF THE DEFENDANT ' S DECISION MUST BE DISMISSED . AS REGARDS THE REQUEST THAT THE COURT SHOULD ORDER THE COMMISSION TO APPOINT THE TWO APPLICANTS , IT IS SUFFICIENT TO STATE THAT IN ANY EVENT THE COURT HAS NO JURISDICTION TO ENTERTAIN SUCH A REQUEST .
