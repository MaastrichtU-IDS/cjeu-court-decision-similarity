THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE REQUIRES MEMBER STATES TO AMEND THEIR NATIONAL PROVISIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE DIRECTIVE WITHIN     MONTHS OF ITS NOTIFICATION AND TO INFORM THE COMMISSION THEREOF FORTH-  WITH . THE PERIOD THUS SPECIFIED EXPIRED ON JANUARY .    THE GOVERNMENT OF THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS DOES NOT DENY THAT IT HAS FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THAT OBLIGATION . IT EXPLAINS THAT THE DELAY IN IMPLEMENTING THE DIRECTIVE WAS DUE TO ITS NEED TO DRAFT NEW LEGISLATION COVERING ALSO A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE DIRECTIVE . IT ALSO STATES THAT THE DIRECTIVE IS ALREADY APPLIED WITHOUT RESTRICTION , IN PRACTICE , FOR ALL UNDERTAKINGS WHOSE HEAD OFFICES ARE IN THE NETHERLANDS OR IN ANOTHER MEMBER STATE OF THE EEC AND WHICH SEEK TO RELY UPON ITS PROVISIONS .   SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES CANNOT EXPUNGE THE FAILURE TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS WITH WHICH THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS IS CHARGED . ACCORDING TO WELL-ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW FIRST , A MEMBER STATE MAY NOT PLEAD PROVISIONS , PRACTICES OR CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING IN ITS INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OBLIGATIONS AND TIME-LIMITS RESULTING FROM COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES , AND SECONDLY MERE ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES , WHICH BY THEIR NATURE MAY BE CHANGED ACCORDING TO THE WHIM OF THE AUTHORITIES AND WHICH LACK APPROPRIATE PUBLICITY CANNOT BE REGARDED AS CONSTITUTING A VALID IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DUTY IMPOSED ON MEMBER STATES BY THE THIRD PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .   THE COURT MUST THEREFORE DECLARE THAT BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE SPECIFIED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 73/239/EEC OF JULY THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY .
