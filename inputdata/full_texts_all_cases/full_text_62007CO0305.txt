Order of the Court (Eighth Chamber) of April – RAI v PTV Programmazioni Televisive
(Case C‑305/07)
Preliminary references – Manifest inadmissibility
Preliminary rulings – Admissibility – Questions referred without sufficient explanation of the factual and legislative context (Art. EC; Statute of the Court
         of Justice, Art. 23) (see paras 14-18)
      
Re: 
Preliminary ruling – Tribunale civile di Genova – Interpretation of Article 86(2) EC – Concept of aid – Fee imposed on all
                  owners of televisual appliances for the purpose of financing the public television broadcasting service – Validity of Commission
                  Decision C(2005) final of April declaring that fee to be compatible with the common market.
               
Operative part
The reference for a preliminary ruling brought by the Tribunale ordinario di Genova by decision of June is manifestly
         inadmissible.
