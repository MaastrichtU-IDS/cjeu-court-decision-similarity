Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF THE ACT OF JANUARY CONCERNING THE CONDITIONS OF ACCESSION AND THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE TREATIES , AND OF CERTAIN RULES OF COMMUNITY LAW , WITH REGARD TO NATIONAL MEASURES RELATING TO QUOTA RESTRICTIONS ON CATCHES OF SOLE AND PLAICE IN THE NORTH SEA , 
Grounds
IN A SERIES OF JUDGMENTS , GIVEN ON JULY AND RECEIVED AT THE COURT THE FOLLOWING SEPTEMBER , THE ECONOMISCHE POLITIERECHTER ( MAGISTRATE IN COMMERCIAL MATTERS ) OF THE ARRONDISSEMENTSRECHTBANK ( DISTRICT COURT ), ROTTERDAM , REFERRED CERTAIN QUESTIONS TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE     EEC TREATY FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY AND ARTICLE OF THE ACT OF ACCESSION SO AS TO ENABLE IT TO ASSESS THE COMPATIBILITY WITH COMMUNITY LAW OF MEASURES LAID DOWN BY REGULATION , ADOPTED BY THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT TO RESTRICT CATCHES OF SOLE AND PLAICE IN THE NORTH SEA .   FROM THE FILE ON THE CASE IT APPEARS THAT CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS WERE INSTITUTED BEFORE THE ECONOMISCHE POLITIERECHTER AGAINST FISHING UNDERTAKINGS OF FISHERMEN FOR INFRINGING THE PROVISIONS OF THE NETHERLANDS REGULATIONS FIXING FOR THE YEAR QUOTAS FOR CATCHES OF SOLE AND PLAICE IN THE NORTH SEA AREA , NAMELY THE ' ' DECREE PROVISIONALLY LAYING DOWN RESTRICTIONS ON CATCHES OF SOLE AND PLAICE , ' '  AND THE ' ' DECREE PROVISIONALLY LAYING DOWN QUOTAS FOR NORTH SEA SOLE AND PLAICE , ' ' . IN THE NATIONAL COURT THE ACCUSED CLAIMED IN THEIR DEFENCE THAT SINCE THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE OF THE ACT OF ACCESSION EXPIRED ON JANUARY , THE MEASURES TO BE TAKEN FOR PROTECTING THE BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES OF THE SEA WERE UNDER THE COMMUNITY ' S JURISDICTION . CONSEQUENTLY THE NETHERLANDS STATE WAS NO LONGER AUTHORIZED TO ENACT THE REGULATIONS WHICH GAVE RISE TO THE PROCEEDINGS . THE ACCUSED ALSO CLAIM THAT EVEN IF THE NETHERLANDS PROVISIONS WERE LEGALLY ENACTED , THEY ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH COMMUNITY LAW BECAUSE THEY CONSTITUTE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST NETHERLANDS FISHERMEN IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE PROVISIONS APPLIED BY THE OTHER MEMBER STATES IN THE SAME MARITIME ZONE ARE LESS STRICT .   TO ENABLE HIM TO SETTLE THIS DISPUTE THE ECONOMISCHE POLITIERECHTER HAS REFERRED THREE QUESTIONS TO THE COURT , WHICH ARE WORDED AS FOLLOWS :    ( ) ON WHAT DATE DID THE PERIOD REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE OF THE ACT CONCERNING THE CONDITIONS OF ACCESSION AND THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE TREATIES EXPIRE?    ( 2)ARE THE MEASURES PURSUANT TO THE REGLEMENT ZEE- EN KUSTVISSERIJ ( REGULATION CONCERNING SEA AND COASTAL FISHING , - STAATSBLAD ) AS SET OUT IN THE BESCHIKKING VOORLOPIGE REGELING VANGSTBEPERKING TONG EN SCHOL ( DECREE PROVISIONALLY LAYING DOWN RESTRICTIONS ON CATCHES OF SOLE AND PLAICE , ) AND THE BESCHIKKING VOORLOPIGE REGELING CONTINGENTERING TONG EN SCHOL NOORDZEE ( DECREE PROVISIONALLY LAYING DOWN QUOTAS FOR NORTH SEA SOLE AND PLAICE , - STAATSBLAD , ) BASED ON DECISIONS OF THE COMMUNITY OR ON OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY THE COMMUNITY ON THE MEMBER STATES BY TREATY     AS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY OR ON POWERS CONFERRED ON THE MEMBER STATES BY THE COMMUNITY?    ( 3)IS THE CONTENT OF THE AFORESAID MEASURES COMPATIBLE WITH COMMUNITY LAW?   FIRST QUESTION ( INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF THE ACT OF ACCESSION )    ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF THE ACT OF ACCESSION , ' ' FROM THE SIXTH YEAR AFTER ACCESSION AT THE LATEST , THE COUNCIL , ACTING ON A PROPOSAL FROM THE COMMISSION , SHALL DETERMINE CONDITIONS FOR FISHING WITH A VIEW TO ENSURING PROTECTION OF THE FISHING GROUNDS AND CONSERVATION OF THE BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES OF THE SEA ' ' . THE DEFINITION OF THE TIME-LIMIT PRESCRIBED BY THIS PROVISION PRESENTS A DIFFICULTY OWING TO THE FACT THAT THE TEXT DOES NOT REFER TO A PRECISE MOMENT BUT TO A PERIOD , DESIGNATED BY THE PHRASE ' ' THE SIXTH YEAR AFTER ACCESSION ' ' . THIS PHRASE CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS REFERRING EITHER TO THE BEGINNING OR TO THE END OF THAT YEAR , THAT IS TO SAY JANUARY OR DECEMBER . IT IS POSSIBLE , HOWEVER , TO RESOLVE THIS DIFFICULTY BY LOOKING AT THE GENERAL CLAUSE IN ARTICLE OF THE ACT OF ACCESSION , PARAGRAPH ( ) OF WHICH PROVIDES THAT ' ' SUBJECT TO THE DATES , TIME-LIMITS AND SPECIAL PROVISIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS ACT , THE APPLICATION OF THE TRANSITIONAL MEASURES SHALL TERMINATE AT THE END OF ' ' . A COMPARISON WITH THIS PROVISION SHOWS THAT THE FIXING OF A PARTICULAR TIME-LIMIT IN ARTICLE WOULD HAVE NO PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE IF THE END OF THE PERIOD SPECIFIED COINCIDED WITH THE END OF THE PERIOD , OF GENERAL APPLICATION , FIXED BY ARTICLE ( ), THAT IS TO SAY , DECEMBER . ACCORDINGLY , THE TIME-LIMIT LAID DOWN BY ARTICLE CAN HAVE NO REAL MEANING UNLESS THE PHRASE ' ' FROM THE SIXTH YEAR AFTER ACCESSION AT THE LATEST ' '  IS INTERPRETED AS REFERRING NOT TO THE BEGINNING , BUT TO THE END OF THE SIXTH YEAR , THAT IS TO SAY , DECEMBER .    THE ANSWER TO THE FIRST QUESTION MUST THEREFORE BE THAT THE PERIOD REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE OF THE ACT CONCERNING THE CONDITIONS OF ACCESSION AND THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE TREATIES EXPIRED ON DECEMBER .   SECOND QUESTION ( COMPETENCE )    IT FOLLOWS FROM THE FOREGOING THAT THE EVENTS WHICH GAVE RISE TO THE PROCEEDINGS PENDING BEFORE THE ECONOMISCHE POLITIERECHTER OCCURRED      AT A TIME WHEN THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD UNDER ARTICLE HAD NOT YET  EXPIRED .   IT SHOULD ALSO BE BORNE IN MIND , HOWEVER , THAT AT THE TIME IN QUESTION THE COUNCIL HAD NOT IMPLEMENTED THE PROTECTIVE MEASURES ENVISAGED BY ARTICLE . THIS LED TO UNCERTAINTY IN THE LAW , BUT IT DID NOT ACTUALLY ENTAIL A LEGAL VACUUM FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF COMMUNITY LAW . THE COURT HAS SHOWN IN ITS JUDGMENT OF FEBRUARY ( CASE 61/COMMISSION V IRELAND ( ) ECR , PARAGRAPHS TO AND TO ), WHAT THE LAW IS APPLICABLE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND HOW POWERS ARE DIVIDED BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND THE MEMBER STATES . IT FOLLOWS THAT DURING THE YEAR THE MEMBER STATES HAD THE RIGHT AND THE DUTY TO ADOPT , WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE SPHERES OF JURISDICTION , ANY MEASURE COMPATIBLE WITHIN COMMUNITY LAW TO PROTECT THE BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES OF THE SEA AND , IN PARTICULAR , TO FIX FISHING QUOTAS FOR FISHING UNDERTAKINGS AND FISHERMEN SUBJECT TO THEIR CONTROL .   THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION MUST THEREFORE BE THAT MEASURES SUCH AS THOSE COVERED BY THE PROVISIONS OF THE NATIONAL REGULATIONS MENTIONED BY THE COURT MAKING THE REFERENCE WERE , AT THE TIME IN QUESTION , WITHIN THE POWERS OF THE MEMBER STATES .  THIRD QUESTION ( SUBSTANTIVE REQUIREMENTS OF COMMUNITY LAW )    ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENTS ON THE FILE AND THE ARGUMENTS PRESENTED BY THE PERSONS PROSECUTED IN THE NATIONAL COURT , THE PROTECTIVE MEASURES INTRODUCED IN THE NETHERLANDS FOR THE YEAR ARE CRITICIZED ON THE GROUND THAT THEY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST NETHERLANDS FISHERMEN , BECAUSE THE PROVISIONS APPLIED BY OTHER MEMBER STATES IN THIS SPHERE ARE LESS STRICT . THE RESULT IS THAT FISHERMEN WHO ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE NETHERLANDS AUTHORITIES CAN , EVEN IN WATERS WITHIN THE NETHERLANDS '  FISHING ZONE , MAKE MORE REWARDING CATCHES THAN THE NETHERLANDS FISHERMEN . IN THE OPINION OF THE ACCUSED , THEREFORE , THE NETHERLANDS REGULATIONS ARE CONTRARY TO THE PRINCIPLE IN ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY WHICH , THEY SAY , REQUIRES EQUAL TREATMENT BETWEEN THE NATIONALS OF ALL THE MEMBER STATES .       IN THIS CONNEXION IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT PROTECTIVE MEASURES AGREED ON WITHIN THE COMMUNITY , IN CONSULTATION WITH THE COMMISSION , ARE BASED ON RESPONSIBILITY SHARED BETWEEN THE MEMBER STATES , IN THE SENSE THAT AT PRESENT EACH STATE REGULATES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF ITS OWN NATIONAL LEGISLATION CONCERNING FISHING QUOTAS , THE CATCHES LANDED IN ITS OWN PORTS . IT CANNOT BE HELD CONTRARY TO THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-DISCRIMINATION TO APPLY NATIONAL LEGISLATION , THE COMPATIBILITY OF WHICH WITH COMMUNITY LAW IS MOREOVER NOT CONTESTED , BECAUSE OTHER MEMBER STATES ALLEGEDLY APPLY LESS STRICT RULES . INEQUALITIES OF THIS KIND , IF THEY EXIST , MUST BE ELIMINATED BY MEANS OF THE CONSULTATIONS PROVIDED FOR BY ANNEX VI TO THE HAGUE RESOLUTION , QUOTED IN THE JUDGMENT REFERRED TO ABOVE , BUT THEY CANNOT BE THE FOUNDATION OF A CHARGE OF DISCRIMINATION WITH REGARD TO THE PROVISIONS MADE BY A MEMBER STATE WHICH APPLIES EQUALLY TO ANY PERSON UNDER ITS JURISDICTION , THE REGULATIONS WHICH IT HAD ADOPTED FOR FISHING QUOTAS .   THE ANSWER TO THE THIRD QUESTION MUST THEREFORE BE THAT NATIONAL PROVISIONS , SUCH AS THOSE IN THE NETHERLANDS REGULATIONS CONCERNING FISHING QUOTAS TO WHICH THE NATIONAL COURT HAS REFERRED , CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS DISCRIMINATORY AS LONG AS THEY ARE APPLIED UNIFORMLY TO ALL THE FISHERMEN UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE MEMBER STATE CONCERNED .

AS THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE , IN SO FAR AS THE PARTIES TO THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS ARE CONCERNED , IN THE NATURE OF A STEP IN THE PROCEEDINGS PENDING BEFORE THE ECONOMISCHE POLITIERECHTER OF THE ARRONDISSEMENTSRECHTBANK , ROTTERDAM , THE DECISION ON COSTS IS A MATTER FOR THAT COURT .
