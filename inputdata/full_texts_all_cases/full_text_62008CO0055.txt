Preliminary rulings – Inadmissibility

         of Justice, Art. 23) (see paras 14-16)
      
Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Tribunal Judicial da Comarca do Porto – Interpretation of Articles 43, and EC –
                  National legislation reserving to a particular body the exclusive right to operate games of chance and pool betting and penalising
                  the activity of organising, promoting and collecting (including by internet) of bets on sporting events – Prohibition on an
                  undertaking based in another Member State operating online gambling and pool betting from promoting organising and operating
                  such gambling and pool betting by internet and making the value of the prizes available to winners.
               
Operative part: 
The reference for a preliminary ruling made by the Tribunal Judicial da Comarca do Porto (Portugal), by decision of December
         2007, is manifestly inadmissible.
