Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Amtsgericht Landau/Isar – Interpretation of Article 8(2) and (4) of Council Directive
                  91/439/EEC of July on driving licences (OJ L 237, p. 1) – Non-recognition by the Member State of residence, on
                  its territory, of a driving licence obtained in another Member State during the period of a temporary ban on applying for
                  a new licence in the Member State of residence.
               
Operative part
Articles 1(2) and 8(2) and (4) of Council Directive 91/439/EEC of July on driving licences, as amended by Regulation
         (EC) No 1882/of the European Parliament and of the Council of September 2003, must be interpreted as meaning that
         they do not preclude a Member State from refusing to recognise the validity of a driving licence issued by another Member
         State where the holder of that licence was, on the date on which the licence was issued, subject to a temporary ban on obtaining
         a new driving licence in the first Member State. The fact that the question of validity arose after the date that marked the
         end of the period of the ban is irrelevant.
