Operative part
The Court: 
Declares that, in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings, in which the declarations for the customs procedure
         for ‘release for free circulation’ were made before September 2005, it is not possible to rely on the decision of September
         of the Dispute Settlement Body of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), adopting a report by the WTO appellate body (WT/DS269/AB/R,
         WT/DS286/AB/R) and two reports by a special WTO group (WT/DS269/R and WT/DS286/R), as amended by the appellate body, either
         in the interpretation of the additional note to Chapter of the combined nomenclature in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1810/of September amending Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/of July on the tariff and statistical
         nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff, or in assessment of the validity of that additional note.
