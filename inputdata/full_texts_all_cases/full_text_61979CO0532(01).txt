Subject of the case
APPLICATION AS DESCRIBED IN THE CLAIMS SET OUT IN THE ORIGINAL ACTIONS , 
Grounds
THE OBJECTION RAISED BY THE COUNCIL MUST BE UPHELD . AN ACTION FOR ANNULMENT OF REGULATIONS NO 3085/AND NO 3086/OF THE COUNCIL IS INADMISSIBLE , SINCE THE REGULATIONS IN QUESTION ARE OF GENERAL APPLICATION AND CANNOT BE ASSIMILATED TO DECISIONS WHICH , ALTHOUGH TAKEN IN THE FORM OF REGULATIONS , ARE OF DIRECT AND INDIVIDUAL CONCERN TO THE APPLICANTS . MOREOVER , EVEN IF SUCH AN ACTION AGAINST THE COUNCIL WERE ADMISSIBLE IN THAT RESPECT IT WOULD NEVERTHELESS BE INADMISSIBLE BECAUSE IT IS OUT OF TIME , HAVING BEEN LODGED AFTER THE EXPIRY OF THE PERIOD LAID DOWN IN THE THIRD PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EAEC TREATY , WHICH CORRESPONDS TO THE THIRD PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY .  THE APPLICANT ' S CLAIM FOR COMPENSATION SEEKS TO OBTAIN PRECISELY THE SAME RESULTS AS THOSE WHICH THEY WOULD OBTAIN FROM THE ANNULMENT OF THE REGULATIONS . THE COURT HAS HELD ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS , IN PARTICULAR IN ITS JUDGMENT OF DECEMBER ( SCHRECKENBERG , CASE 59/( ) ECR ) THAT ALTHOUGH A PARTY MAY TAKE ACTION BY MEANS OF A CLAIM FOR COMPENSATION WITHOUT BEING OBLIGED BY ANY PROVISION OF LAW TO SEEK THE ANNULMENT OF THE ILLEGAL MEASURE WHICH CAUSES HIM DAMAGE , HE MAY NOT BY THIS MEANS CIRCUMVENT THE INADMISSIBILITY OF AN APPLICATION WHICH CONCERNS THE SAME ILLEGALITY AND WHICH HAS THE SAME FINANCIAL END IN VIEW . THE CLAIM FOR COMPENSATION IS THEREFORE INADMISSIBLE .  IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE APPLICATIONS ARE INADMISSIBLE IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE DIRECTED AGAINST THE COUNCIL AND MUST THEREFORE BE DISMISSED .  
Decision on costs
ACCORDING TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .  HOWEVER , ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE STATES THAT IN ACTIONS BROUGHT BY SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES THE INSTITUTIONS SHALL BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ( FIRST CHAMBER )   HEREBY ORDERS AS FOLLOWS :   . THE APPLICATIONS ARE DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE DIRECTED AGAINST THE COUNCIL .  . THE APPLICANTS AND THE COUNCIL SHALL BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .
