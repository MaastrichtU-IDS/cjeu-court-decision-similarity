IN CASE 114/, REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE BUNDESFINANZHOF ( FEDERAL FINANCE COURT ) FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  DR RITTER GMBH & CO , WITH REGISTERED OFFICIES IN KOLN-DEUTZ ,   V  OBERFINANZDIREKTION ( PRINCIPAL FINANCE OFFICE ) HAMBURG ,   
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF HEADINGS 21.AND 22.OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF , 
Grounds
BY AN ORDER DATED APRIL WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON MAY THE BUNDESFINANZHOF REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY TWO QUESTIONS AS TO THE INTERPRETATION OF HEADING 22., OR ALTERNATIVELY HEADING 21., OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF .   IT APPEARS FROM THE FILE ON THE CASE THAT THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION REQUESTED A BINDING CUSTOMS TARIFF RULING FROM THE REVENUE AUTHORITIES FOR A PRODUCT CALLED ' ' WHOLE YEAST ' '  AND DESCRIBED IN THE ORDER MAKING THE REFERENCE IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS : ' ' THE PRODUCT IS COMPOSED OF ( INACTIVE ) BREWER ' S YEAST , WATER AND 3.9% NATURAL CITRUS-FRUIT JUICE . IT IS LIQUID AND SUITABLE FOR DIRECT CONSUMPTION AS A BEVERAGE . ACCORDING TO THE WORDING ON THE WRAPPING IT SERVES AS A FOOD SUPPLEMENT , HELPS TO MAINTAIN WORKING CAPACITY AND GIVES THE SKIN A HEALTHY COMPLEXION . FROM ONE TO THREE TABLESPOONFULS MUST BE TAKEN THREE TIMES A DAY . ' '       THE REVENUE AUTHORITIES ARE OF THE OPINION THAT THE PRODUCT IN QUESTION SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS A ' ' BEVERAGE ' '  UNDER HEADING 22.BECAUSE IT IS A PRODUCT SUITABLE FOR DIRECT CONSUMPTION AS A BEVERAGE , REGARDLESS OF ITS COMPOSITION , MODE OF CONSUMPTION AND THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT IS DRUNK . THE PLAINTIFF ON THE OTHER HAND CONTENDS THAT THE PRODUCT IN QUESTION , THE MAIN INGREDIENT OF WHICH IS BREWER ' S YEAST , SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS A YEAST UNDER HEADING 21..    THE BUNDESFINANZHOF CONSIDERS THAT A DECISION DEPENDS ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE WORD ' ' BEVERAGES ' '  IN HEADING 22., ACCORDING TO WHETHER THAT TERM IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS INCLUDING ALL LIQUIDS INTENDED FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION , OR ONLY THOSE PRODUCTS INTENDED TO QUENCH THIRST WHICH THE WORD IS COMMONLY USED TO DENOTE . IN THE LATTER CASE A LIQUID SUCH AS THAT IN QUESTION WHICH IS INTENDED TO BE TAKEN FOR HEALTH REASONS SHOULD NOT BE CLASSIFIED AS A ' ' BEVERAGE ' ' .   IN ORDER TO CLARIFY THE ISSUE THE BUNDESFINANZHOF HAS PUT THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS :   . IS THE EXPRESSION ' ' OTHER NON-ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES ' '  WITHIN THE MEANING OF TARIFF HEADING 22.OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF TO BE INTERPRETED AS INCLUDING A PRODUCT WHICH IS COMPOSED OF BREWER ' S YEAST , WATER AND 3.9% NATURAL CITRUS-FRUIT JUICE , IS LIQUID AND SUITABLE FOR CONSUMPTION AS A BEVERAGE AND IS INTENDED TO BE TAKEN SEVERAL TIMES DAILY IN SMALL QUANTITIES FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF HEALTH?   . IF QUESTION IS ANSWERED IN THE NEGATIVE : IS TARIFF HEADING 21.TO BE INTERPRETED , IN CONJUNCTION WITH GENERAL RULE ( B ) FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF , AS INCLUDING THE PRODUCT DESCRIBED ABOVE?     THE TARIFF HEADINGS REFERRED TO IN THE QUESTIONS FORM PART OF CHAPTER OF THE TARIFF , ENTITLED ' ' MISCELLANEOUS EDIBLE PREPARATIONS ' ' , AND CHAPTER , ENTITLED ' ' BEVERAGES , SPIRITS AND VINEGAR ' ' . IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE RELEVANT TO THE DISPUTE , THEY ARE WORDED AS FOLLOWS :   21.NATURAL YEASTS (. . . INACTIVE ) . . . OTHER .  22.LEMONADE , FLAVOURED SPA WATERS AND FLAVOURED AERATED WATERS , AND OTHER NON-ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES , NOT INCLUDING FRUIT AND VEGETABLE JUICES FALLING WITHIN HEADING NO 20..         IN CONFORMITY WITH THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF THE EXPRESSION ' ' OTHER . . . BEVERAGES ' '  IN HEADING 22.IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS A GENERIC CONCEPT EMBRACING ALL LIQUIDS INTENDED FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION , IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE NOT INCLUDED IN ANY OTHER SPECIFIC CLASSIFICATION .   THE SCOPE OF THAT CONCEPT MUST BE DETERMINED ON THE BASIS OF CRITERIA WHICH ARE BOTH OBJECTIVE AND VERIFIABLE . IT IS NOT PERMISSIBLE , THEREFORE , TO MAKE ITS SCOPE DEPENDENT ON PURELY SUBJECTIVE , VARIABLE FACTORS SUCH AS THE MANNER IN WHICH THE PRODUCT IS TAKEN OR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT IS CONSUMED , TO QUENCH THIRST , FOR EXAMPLE , TO IMPROVE HEALTH , OR FOR SOME OTHER PURPOSE . WITHIN THE MEANING OF THAT HEADING THEREFORE , ' ' BEVERAGES ' '  MUST BE UNDERSTOOD TO SIGNIFY ANY LIQUID SUITABLE AND INTENDED FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION REGARDLESS OF THE QUANTITY IN WHICH IT IS ABSORBED , OR THE SPECIAL PURPOSES FOR WHICH VARIOUS KINDS OF LIQUIDS MAY BE CONSUMED .   THE CLASSIFICATION OF A PRODUCT AS A BEVERAGE WITHIN THE MEANING OF HEADING 22.CANNOT , MOREOVER , DEPEND ON THE BASIC INGREDIENTS USED . THE DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTIC IN THE TARIFF HEADING IN QUESTION IS THE FACT THAT THE PRODUCTS IN QUESTION ARE LIQUIDS AND ARE INTENDED FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION . ALTHOUGH THE PRODUCT IN QUESTION IS MADE BASICALLY FROM YEAST , WHICH FALLS UNDER HEADING 21., THE DECISIVE CHARACTERISTIC AS FAR AS CLASSIFICATION IN THE TARIFF IS CONCERNED IS ITS LIQUID STATE , CHIEFLY OBTAINED BY ADDING WATER , AND NOT THE BASIC INGREDIENT EMPLOYED .   THAT REASONING IS SUPPORTED BY THE ACTUAL WORDING OF THE HEADING IN QUESTION WHICH , AFTER REFERRING TO ' ' BEVERAGES ' '  IN GENERAL , EXPRESSLY EXCLUDES FRUIT AND VEGETABLE JUICES WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN HEADING 20.IN CHAPTER , COVERING ' ' PREPARATIONS OF VEGETABLES , FRUIT OR OTHER PARTS OF PLANTS ' ' . THAT INDICATES THAT WITHOUT THAT EXPRESS EXCEPTION THE JUICES IN QUESTION WOULD BE CLASSIFIED IN THE CHAPTER ON BEVERAGES , AND NOT IN THAT COVERING THE RELEVANT BASIC INGREDIENTS .       A SIMILAR INDICATION IS TO BE FOUND IN THE EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF WHICH EXCLUDE ' ' TONIC PREPARATIONS ' '  FROM HEADING 21.( WHICH , TOGETHER WITH YEASTS , IS INCLUDED IN THE CHAPTER ON EDIBLE PREPARATIONS ) WHEN THEY ARE PUT UP AS LIQUIDS SUITABLE FOR DIRECT CONSUMPTION AS BEVERAGES . THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE OF THAT NOTE MAY BE EXTENDED BY ANALOGY TO THE AQUEOUS DILUTION OF YEAST LIKE THAT UNDER CONSIDERATION IN THE PRESENT CASE .   THE REPLY TO THE FIRST QUESTION MUST THEREFORE BE THAT THE CONCEPT OF ' ' OTHER NON-ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES ' '  IN HEADING 22.OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF MUST BE INTERPRETED AS INCLUDING A PRODUCT COMPOSED OF BREWER ' S YEAST , WATER AND 3.9% NATURAL CITRUS FRUIT JUICE , PUT UP IN LIQUID FORM AND POTABLE , AND INTENDED TO BE TAKEN SEVERAL TIMES DAILY IN SMALL QUANTITIES FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF HEALTH .   IT IS THEREFORE UNNECESSARY TO REPLY TO THE SECOND QUESTION .
