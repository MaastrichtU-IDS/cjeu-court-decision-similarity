IN CASE 77/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE SOZIALGERICHT ( SOCIAL COURT ) STUTTGART FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  ANASTASIA PESKELOGLOU  AND  BUNDESANSTALT FUR ARBEIT , NURNBERG ( FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT OFFICE , NUREMBERG ), REPRESENTED BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE ARBEITSAMT ( EMPLOYMENT OFFICE )   
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE ACT CONCERNING THE CONDITIONS OF ACCESSION OF THE HELLENIC REPUBLIC AND THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE TREATIES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), 
Grounds
BY AN ORDER DATED FEBRUARY WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON FEBRUARY , THE SOZIALGERICHT ( SOCIAL COURT ) STUTTGART REFERRED TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY A QUESTION ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE ACT CONCERNING THE CONDITIONS OF ACCESSION OF THE HELLENIC REPUBLIC AND THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE TREATIES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' ' THE ACT OF ACCESSION ' ' .   THAT QUESTION AROSE IN THE COURSE OF AN ACTION PENDING BEFORE THE SOZIALGERICHT STUTTGART BETWEEN MRS ANASTASIA PESKELOGLOU , A GREEK NATIONAL RESIDING IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY , AND THE BUNDESANSTALT FUR ARBEIT NURNBERG ( FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT OFFICE , NUREMBERG ) IN RELATION TO MRS PESKELOGLOU ' S ENTITLEMENT TO A WORK PERMIT .   MRS PESKELOGLOU IMMIGRATED INTO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY ON NOVEMBER IN ORDER TO JOIN HER HUSBAND THERE . ON MAY SHE     APPLIED FOR A WORK PERMIT TO ENABLE HER TO WORK IN A STUTTGART UNDERTAKING ; THAT APPLICATION WAS REFUSED BY THE COMPETENT EMPLOYMENT OFFICE ON THE GROUND THAT THE PLAINTIFF ' ' HAD NOT COMPLETED THE WAITING PERIOD OF FOUR OR THREE YEARS APPLICABLE IN THE CASE OF PERSONS JOINING THEIR SPOUSES ' ' .   ACCORDING TO THE SOZIALGERICHT , THE NATIONAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE UNTIL AUGUST , NAMELY ARTICLE OF THE ARBEITSFORDERUNGSGESETZ ( LAW ON THE PROMOTION OF EMPLOYMENT ) AS AMENDED BY THE LAW OF JUNE ( BUNDESGESETZBLATT I , P . ), CONFERRED UPON THE SPOUSE OF A FOREIGN WORKER THE RIGHT TO THE GRANT OF A WORK PERMIT WHERE , REGARD BEING HAD TO THE SITUATION AND LABOUR MARKET DEVELOPMENTS , THE POSITION SOUGHT BY HIM CANNOT BE FILLED BY GERMAN WORKERS OF BY FOREIGN WORKERS HAVING A PRIOR CLAIM TO EMPLOYMENT .   ON THE OTHER HAND , AS A RESULT OF AN AMENDMENT OF THOSE PROVISIONS A WORK PERMIT FOR A FIRST EMPLOYMENT MAY , ACCORDING TO THE LAW IN FORCE ON OCTOBER , BE GRANTED TO SPOUSES OF FOREIGN WORKERS IF THEY HAVE COMPLETED A PERIOD OF LAWFUL RESIDENCE OF FOUR YEARS IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY ; HOWEVER , ' ' IN RESPECT OF EMPLOYMENT IN THOSE SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY IN WHICH THE NUMBER OF VACANCIES NOTIFIED TO THE EMPLOYMENT OFFICE CONSIDERABLY EXCEEDS THE NUMBER OF REGISTERED UNEMPLOYED , A WORK PERMIT MAY BE ISSUED TO SPOUSES AFTER A PERIOD OF LAWFUL RESIDENCE OF TWO YEARS ' ' .   THE SOZIALGERICHT , CONSIDERING THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE THE DISPUTE ON THE BASIS OF THE AMENDED LEGISLATION , TOOK THE VIEW THAT THE MAIN ACTION WAS UNFOUNDED UNDER THE LAW IN FORCE ON OCTOBER . HOWEVER , SINCE IN ITS VIEW THE AMENDMENTS THUS MADE MIGHT BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH ARTICLE ( ) OF THE ACT OF ACCESSION , IT DECIDED TO STAY THE PROCEEDINGS AND TO REFER TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE THE FOLLOWING QUESTION :    ' ' MAY THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE ACT CONCERNING THE CONDITIONS OF ACCESSION OF THE HELLENIC REPUBLIC AND THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE TREATIES , WHICH CONSTITUTE ONE OF THE DOCUMENTS CONCERNING THE ACCESSION OF THE HELLENIC REPUBLIC TO THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY , TO THE EUROPEAN ATOMIC ENERGY COMMUNITY AND TO THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY ( BUNDESGESETZBLATT , PART II , P . ET SEQ .), BE INTERPRETED AS PERMITTING THE EXISTING NATIONAL RULES CONTAINED IN ARTICLE OF THE ARBEITSFORDERUNGSGESETZ ( LAW ON THE PROMOTION OF EMPLOYMENT ), WHICH COVER THE FIRST GRANT OF A WORK PERMIT TO A GREEK NATIONAL , ACCORDING TO WHICH THE WORK PERMIT IS TO BE ISSUED ACCORDING TO THE SITUATION AND EVOLUTION OF THE EMPLOYMENT MARKET IN THE LIGHT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE INDIVIDUAL CASE ,     TO BE MADE MORE STRINGENT BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT BY THE SIXTH LAW AMENDING THE ARBEITSFORDERUNGSGESETZ , NAMELY THE WARTEZEITGESETZ ( LAW ON WAITING PERIODS ) OF AUGUST ( BUNDESGESETZBLATT , PART I , P . ), IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SIXTH ORDER , DATED SEPTEMBER , AMENDING THE ARBEITSERLAUBNISVERORDNUNG ( WORK PERMITS ORDER ) ( BUNDESGESETZBLATT PART I , P . ), THE FIRST GRANT OF A WORK PERMIT IS MADE SUBJECT ALSO IN THE CASE OF A GREEK NATIONAL TO THE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT OF COMPLETION OF A WAITING PERIOD OF AT LEAST TWO YEARS?  ' '   BY THAT QUESTION , THE SOZIALGERICHT STUTTGART IS ASKING WHETHER THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE ACT OF ACCESSION PERMITS NATIONAL RULES IN FORCE BEFORE AUGUST TO BE MADE MORE STRINGENT AS REGARDS GREEK NATIONALS BY THE INTRODUCTION OF AN ADDITIONAL RESIDENCE REQUIREMENT AS ONE OF THE CONDITIONS FOR THE GRANT OF A WORK PERMIT .   THE FIRST SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE ACT OF ACCESSION STATES THAT ARTICLES TO AND TO OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1612/OF THE COUNCIL OF OCTOBER ON FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT FOR WORKERS WITHIN THE COMMUNTY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P . ) ARE TO APPLY IN THE PRESENT MEMBER STATES WITH REGARD TO GREEK NATIONALS ONLY AS FROM JANUARY . THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH PROVIDES THAT DURING THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD THE PRESENT MEMBER STATES MAY MAINTAIN IN FORCE , WITH REGARD TO GREEK NATIONALS , NATIONAL PROVISIONS SUBMITTING TO PRIOR AUTHORIZATION IMMIGRATION UNDERTAKEN WITH A VIEW TO PURSUING AN ACTICITY AS AN EMPLOYED PERSON OR THE TAKING UP AND PURSUIT OF PAID EMPLOYMENT , OR BOTH .   THAT PROVISION IS THEREFORE APPLICABLE TO ALL GREEK WORKERS , WHEREAS THE POSITION OF SPOUSES AND DEPENDENT CHILDREN IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THE ACT OF ACCESSION . THE FIRST SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) PROVIDES THAT ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1612/, WHICH IN PARTICULAR CONFERS ON SPOUSES THE RIGHT TO TAKE UP EMPLOYMENT , IS TO APPLY IN THE PRESENT MEMBER STATES WITH REGARD TO GREEK NATIONALS ONLY AS FROM JANUARY . AS A TRANSITIONAL MEASURE , THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) PROVIDES THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY OF A WORKER WHO IS A NATIONAL OF A MEMBER STATE ARE TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE EMPLOYED IN THE TERRITORY OF THE MEMBER STATE WHERE THEY HAVE SETTLED WITH THE WORKER , IF THEY ARE RESIDENT FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS IN THAT TERRITORY ; THAT PERIOD OF RESIDENCE IS TO     BE REDUCED TO MONTHS AS FROM JANUARY . HOWEVER , THE THIRD SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) EXPRESSLY PROVIDES THAT THE RULES OF PARAGRAPH ( ) ' ' SHALL NOT PREJUDICE MORE FAVOURABLE NATIONAL PROVISIONS ' ' .   IN THIS CASE , THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION IS A GREEK NATIONAL , MARRIED TO A WORKER OF THE SAME NATIONALITY ; SHE IS THEREFORE COVERED BOTH BY ARTICLE ( ) AND BY ARTICLE ( ). AS THE QUESTION SUBMITTED BY THE NATIONAL COURT EXPRESSLY REFERS TO ARTICLE ( ), THAT PROVISION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE FIRST PLACE .   THE TRANSITIONAL PROVISION CONTAINED IN THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE ACT OF ACCESSION AUTHORIZES THE EXISTING MEMBER STATES TO MAINTAIN IN FORCE UNTIL JANUARY WITH REGARD TO GREEK NATIONALS NATIONAL PROVISIONS SUBMITTING TO PRIOR AUTHORIZATION IMMIGRATION UNDERTAKEN WITH A VIEW TO PURSUING AN ACTIVITY AS AN EMPLOYED PERSON OR THE TAKING UP AND PURSUIT OF PAID EMPLOYMENT . IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE SAME RIGHT WAS CONFERRED UPON GREECE IN ITS RELATIONS WITH THE OTHER MEMBER STATES .   THAT PROVISION , WHICH IS INTENDED TO PREVENT DISTURBANCE OF THE LABOUR MARKET BOTH IN GREECE AND IN THE OTHER MEMBER STATES AS A RESULT OF IMMEDIATE AND SUBSTANTIAL MOVEMENTS OF WORKERS FOLLOWING ACCESSION , CONSTITUTES A DEROGATION FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF THE FREE MOVEMENT OF WORKERS LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY . AS SUCH IT MUST BE INTERPRETED RESTRICTIVELY , AS IS APPARENT FROM ARTICLE OF THE ACT OF ACCESSION WHICH LAYS DOWN THE PRINCIPLE THAT ARTICLE OF THE TREATY IS IMMEDIATELY APPLICABLE , SUBJECT TO THE TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS CONTAINED INTER ALIA IN ARTICLE .    FROM THAT IT FOLLOWS THAT THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY IS AUTHORIZED TO MAINTAIN EXISTING RESTRICTIONS BUT MAY NOT IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES DURING THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD MAKE MORE STRINGENT THE CONDITIONS ON THE TAKING UP AND PURSUIT OF EMPLOYMENT BY GREEK NATIONALS THROUGH THE INTRODUCTION OF FRESH RESTRICTIVE MEASURES .   ARTICLE ( ) DOES NOT AFFECT THAT CONCLUSION . INDEED , IT WOULD BE UNREASONABLE TO INTERPRET ARTICLE ( ) AS MEANING THAT THE NATIONAL     LEGISLATURE WAS ENTITLED TO MAKE MORE STRINGENT THE CONDITIONS FOR THE ENTITLEMENT OF SPOUSES AND MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY ALONE TO TAKE UP EMPLOYMENT , SINCE THAT WOULD HAVE THE UNACCEPTABLE CONSEQUENCE THAT THE LATTER WOULD BE IN A MORE UNFAVOURABLE POSITION THAN GREEK NATIONALS IN GENERAL .   THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION SUBMITTED SHOULD THEREFORE BE THAT ARTICLE ( ) OF THE ACT OF ACCESSION MUST BE INTERPRETED AS NOT PERMITTING NATIONAL PROVISIONS CONCERNING THE FIRST GRANT OF A WORK PERMIT TO A GREEK NATIONAL TO BE MADE MORE RESTRICTIVE AFTER THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE ACT OF ACCESSION .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE GREEK GOVERNMENT AND THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , WHICH HAVE SUBMITTED OBSERVATIONS TO THE COURT , ARE NOT RECOVERABLE .

Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ( FOURTH CHAMBER ),   IN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION SUBMITTED TO IT BY THE SOZIALGERICHT STUTTGART BY ORDER OF FEBRUARY , HEREBY RULES :   ARTICLE ( ) OF THE ACT CONCERNING THE CONDITIONS OF ACCESSION OF THE HELLENIC REPUBLIC AND THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE TREATIES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) MUST BE INTERPRETED AS NOT PERMITTING NATIONAL     PROVISIONS CONCERNING THE FIRST GRANT OF A WORK PERMIT TO A GREEK NATIONAL TO BE MADE MORE RESTRICTIVE AFTER THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THAT ACT .
