Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT COMMISSION DECISION 385/81/ECSC OF FEBRUARY CONCERNING CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS TO BE FULFILLED BY COMMUNITY PRODUCERS OF STEEL TUBE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) IS VOID OR , IN THE ALTERNATIVE , THAT IT IS VOID AS REGARDS THE APPLICANTS , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON APRIL , FOUR UNDERTAKINGS , PRODUCERS OF STEEL TUBE , INSTITUTED PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY TO HAVE COMMISSION DECISION 385/81/ECSC OF FEBRUARY CONCERNING CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS TO BE FULFILLED BY COMMUNITY PRODUCERS OF STEEL TUBE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) DECLARED VOID .   THE CONTESTED DECISION WAS ADOPTED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A SYSTEM INSTITUTED BY COMMISSION DECISION 2794/80/ECSC OF OCTOBER ESTABLISHING A SYSTEM OF STEEL PRODUCTION QUOTAS FOR UNDERTAKINGS IN THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ). UNDER THAT SYSTEM , MATERIAL FOR TUBE IS EXEMPTED FROM QUOTAS PROVIDED THAT IT IS ACTUALLY USED     WITHIN THE COMMON MARKET FOR THE PRODUCTION OF TUBES . IN ADDITION , FOR SOME OF THAT MATERIAL , A SPECIAL SUPERVISORY REGIME WAS ESTABLISHED .   IN THE RECITALS IN THE PREAMBLE TO THE CONTESTED DECISION , THE COMMISSION STATES THAT THE EXEMPTION AND THE SPECIAL REGIME REQUIRE THE COMMISSION TO BE INFORMED OF , AND ENABLED TO CHECK , THE ACTUAL USE TO WHICH THE MATERIAL IN QUESTION IS PUT AND THAT SUCH A CHECK CAN BE CARRIED OUT ONLY AMONG TUBE PRODUCERS WHICH , IN THIS CAPACITY , ARE NOT UNDERTAKINGS WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY . FOR THOSE REASONS , THE COMMISSION RESORTED TO ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY SO AS TO EXTEND , BY MEANS OF THE CONTESTED DECISION , THE APPLICATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY TO TUBE PRODUCERS .   ARTICLE OF THE CONTESTED DECISION REQUIRED TUBE PRODUCERS TO FURNISH TO THE COMMISSION , ON A MONTHLY BASIS , INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRODUCTION OF TUBE AND THE ORIGIN OF THE MATERIAL FOR SUCH TUBE . ARTICLE PROVIDES THAT THE COMMISSION , ' ' IN THE EXERCISE OF THE POWERS CONFERRED ON IT BY ARTICLE OF THE TREATY ' ' , IS TO VERIFY THE ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY TUBE PRODUCERS , AND STATES THAT , IN THE EVENT OF NON-COMPLIANCE , THE FINES AND PENALTY PAYMENTS PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF THE TREATY ARE TO APPLY .   BY VIRTUE OF ARTICLE THE DECISION WAS TO CEASE TO APPLY AT THE SAME TIME AS THE SYSTEM OF PRODUCTION QUOTAS AND NOT LATER THAN JUNE . WHILST THE SYSTEM OF PRODUCTION QUOTAS , WHICH UNDER DECISION 2794/80/ECSC WAS TO CEASE TO APPLY AS FROM THE AFOREMENTIONED DATE , WAS EXTENDED SUBJECT TO ESSENTIALLY THE SAME EXCEPTIONS , THE CONTESTED DECISION WAS NOT RENEWED OR REPLACED BY OTHER VERIFICATION MEASURES IMPOSED UPON TUBE PRODUCERS .   IT IS CLEAR FROM THE DOCUMENTS IN THE CASE THAT , DURING THE PERIOD OF VALIDITY OF THE CONTESTED DECISION , THE APPLICANTS DID NOT FURNISH ANY INFORMATION AND THAT THE COMMISSION CONFINED ITSELF TO SENDING THEM A LETTER OF REMINDER . THE COMMISSION DID NOT CARRY OUT ANY VERIFICATION OR CHECKS IN THE CASE OF THE APPLICANTS . NOR DID IT IMPOSE ANY FINE OR PERIODIC PENALTY PAYMENT UPON THEM .       IN THE WRITTEN PROCEDURE , THE APPLICANTS CLAIMED THAT THE DECISION SHOULD BE DECLARED VOID , SUBMITTING THAT THERE HAD BEEN A MISUSE OF POWERS AFFECTING THEM , THAT THE COMMISSION HAD NO COMPETENCE IN REGARD TO THEM AND THAT THE DECISION WAS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE TREATY . THE COMMISSION CONTENDED THAT THE APPLICATION SHOULD BE DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE ON THE GROUND THAT THE APPLICANTS , WHICH ARE NOT UNDERTAKINGS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE TREATY , MAY ONLY CONTEST INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS AND IN ANY EVENT HAVE NOT MADE OUT A PRIMA FACIE CASE THAT THE GENERAL DECISION , WHICH THEY CLAIM SHOULD BE DECLARED VOID , CONSTITUTED A MISUSE OF POWERS AFFECTING THEM WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .   IN THE COURSE OF THE ORAL PROCEDURE , THE COMMISSION EMPHASIZED THAT , IN ITS OPINION , THE WORDING OF THE DECISION DID NOT PERMIT THE MERE FAILURE TO FURNISH THE INFORMATION REQUIRED BY ARTICLE OF THE DECISION TO BE PUNISHED BY THE IMPOSITION OF THE FINES AND PENALTY PAYMENTS PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY . SINCE THE REFERENCE TO ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY APPEARS ONLY IN ARTICLE OF THE DECISION , ONLY NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE DUTY , IMPOSED BY THAT ARTICLE , TO ALLOW VERIFICATION WORK TO BE CARRIED OUT IN SITU , IS CAPABLE OF ATTRACTING A PENALTY . THE COMMISSION , MOREOVER , ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT NO LONGER HAS THE POWER TO UNDERTAKE VERIFICATION WORK IN SITU UNDER THE DECISION . AS A RESULT , IT STATED THAT IT WOULD NO LONGER TAKE ACTION AGAINST THE APPLICANTS ON THE BASIS OF THE DECISION . THE APPLICANTS HAVE NOT RAISED ANY OBJECTION TO THAT STANDPOINT .   IT MUST THEREFORE BE CONCLUDED THAT THE ACTION CONCERNS A DECISION WHICH HAS NOT HAD , AND CAN NO LONGER HAVE , ANY ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE APPLICANTS AND THAT ACCORDINGLY IT HAS CEASED TO HAVE ANY PURPOSE .
