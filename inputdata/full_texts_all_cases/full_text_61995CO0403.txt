Summary
The combined effect of the first paragraph of Article of the Statute of the Court of Justice and Article 112(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure is that an appeal must indicate precisely the contested elements of the judgment of the Court of First Instance which the appellant seeks to have set aside and also the legal arguments advanced in support of the appeal.An appeal which simply repeats or reproduces verbatim the pleas in law and arguments already submitted to the Court of First Instance, including those based on factual allegations expressly dismissed by that Court, does not meet that requirement; such an appeal merely seeks, in reality, reconsideration of the application submitted before the Court of First Instance, which, under Article of the Statute of the Court of Justice, falls outside the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice. Where all the other pleas advanced in an appeal against a judgment of the Court of First Instance have been rejected, the plea concerning the order for costs must, pursuant to the second paragraph of Article of the Statute of the Court of Justice, be declared inadmissible.
