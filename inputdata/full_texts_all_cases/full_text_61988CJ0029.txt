Summary
Article of the EEC Treaty and Regulation No 1408/provide only for the aggregation of insurance periods completed in different Member States . They do not, however, regulate the conditions under which those insurance periods are constituted . The conditions governing the right or obligation to become a member of a social security scheme are a matter to be determined by the legislation of each Member State ( see the judgments of July in Case 266/Brunori v Landesversicherungsanstalt Rheinproving (( )) ECR and of April in Case 110/Coonan v Insurance Officer (( )) ECR ). They are not therefore applicable for the purpose of determining the conditions of affiliation to a social security scheme, whether compulsory or voluntary .
