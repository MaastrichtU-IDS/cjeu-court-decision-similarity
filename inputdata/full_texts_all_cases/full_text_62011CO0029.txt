Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Tribunalul Suceava – Registration of second-hand motor vehicles previously registered
                  in other Member States – National legislation making the first registration of such motor vehicles conditional upon payment
                  of an environmental tax, whereas second-hand motor vehicles already present on the national market are exempt from payment
                  of that tax on the occasion of re-registration – Whether the national legislation is compatible with the first and second
                  paragraphs of Article TFEU – Obstacle to the free movement of goods.
               
Operative part
Article TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a Member State from introducing a pollution tax affecting motor vehicles
         on their first registration in that Member State, if that fiscal measure is so designed as to discourage the putting into
         service, in that Member State, of second-hand vehicles bought in other Member States, without, however, discouraging the purchase
         of second-hand vehicles of the same age and condition on the national market.
