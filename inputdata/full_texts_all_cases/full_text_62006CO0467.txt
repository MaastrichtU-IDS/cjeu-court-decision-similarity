Order of the Court (Seventh Chamber) of March – 
Consel Gi. Emme v SLALA
(Case C‑467/06)
Preliminary rulings – Inadmissibility
Preliminary rulings – Admissibility – Questions referred without sufficient explanation of the factual and legislative context (Art. EC; Statute of the Court

Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Tribunale civile di Genova – Direct award of the management of public services and public
                  infrastructures to a company responsible for the monitoring of the market in question – Conferral on that company of the power
                  to determine the substance of the concession contracts existing between its own competitors and the State and to terminate
                  those contracts.
               
Operative part
The reference for a preliminary ruling brought by the Tribunale civile di Genova by decision of November is manifestly
         inadmissible.
