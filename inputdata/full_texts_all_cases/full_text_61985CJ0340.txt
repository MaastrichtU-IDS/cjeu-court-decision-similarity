Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON NOVEMBER 1985, ACCIAIERIE E FERRIERE DI PORTO NOGARO SPA ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS "PORTO NOGARO "), WHOSE PLACE OF BUSINESS IS IN SAN GIORGIO DI NOGARO ( UDINE ), BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY PRIMARILY FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE COMMISSION' S DECISION OF OCTOBER IMPOSING ON THE APPLICANT A FINE OF 217*ECU, CALCULATED AT THE RATE OF ECU PER TONNE OF EXCESS PRODUCTION OR DELIVERY, FOR EXCEEDING DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF ITS PRODUCTION QUOTA FOR REINFORCING BARS ( CATEGORY V ) BY 1*TONNES, ITS PRODUCTION QUOTA FOR MERCHANT BARS ( CATEGORY VI ) BY 2*TONNES AND ITS DELIVERY QUOTA FOR THE LATTER CATEGORY BY TONNES . IN THE ALTERNATIVE, THE APPLICANT SEEKS A REDUCTION OF THE FINE IMPOSED .  REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING FOR AN ACCOUNT OF THE FACTS, THE SUBMISSIONS AND ARGUMENTS PUT FORWARD BY PORTO NOGARO AND THE ARGUMENTS RELIED UPON BY THE COMMISSION IN ITS DEFENCE .  IN SUPPORT OF ITS APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT, PORTO NOGARO, WHICH DOES NOT DISPUTE THE FIGURES CALCULATED BY THE COMMISSION FOR THE EXCESS PRODUCTION AND DELIVERIES, HAS PUT FORWARD TWO SUBMISSIONS .  IN ITS APPLICATION PORTO NOGARO CONTENDED FIRST OF ALL THAT, BY NOTIFYING IT OF A DECISION AUTHORIZING IT TO CARRY FORWARD ITS QUOTAS TO THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF AND BY LIMITING SUCH AUTHORIZATION TO THAT QUARTER, THE COMMISSION DEPRIVED IT OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DERIVING ANY BENEFIT FROM SUCH AUTHORIZATION . IF THE AUTHORIZATION TO CARRY FORWARD THE QUOTAS HAD NOT BEEN SO RESTRICTED, THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY EXCESS PRODUCTION OR DELIVERIES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF .  IN ITS FIRST SUBMISSION THE APPLICANT IS IN FACT CALLING IN QUESTION THE VALIDITY OF THE DECISION OF MARCH 1983, WHICH HAS BECOME CONCLUSIVE SINCE IT WAS NOT CONTESTED WITHIN THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED BY THE TREATY . THE COURT HAS CONSISTENTLY HELD THAT AN APPLICANT MAY NOT, IN PROCEEDINGS FOR ANNULMENT DIRECTED AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL DECISION, RAISE AN OBJECTION OF ILLEGALITY AGAINST OTHER INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS WHICH WERE ADDRESSED TO IT AND WHICH HAVE BECOME CONCLUSIVE . THE FIRST SUBMISSION MUST THEREFORE BE REJECTED AS UNFOUNDED .  SECONDLY, IN ITS REPLY, PORTO NOGARO ARGUED THAT THE COMMISSION' S FAILURE TO REPLY TO ITS REQUEST TO CARRY FORWARD THE QUOTAS TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF WAS EQUIVALENT TO TACIT AUTHORIZATION WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF NULLIFYING THE EXCESS PRODUCTION AND DELIVERIES IN RESPECT OF WHICH PENALTIES WERE IMPOSED .  ACCORDING TO THE FIRST SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE COURT' S RULES OF PROCEDURE, NO FRESH ISSUE MAY BE RAISED IN THE COURSE OF PROCEEDINGS UNLESS IT IS BASED ON MATTERS OF LAW OR OF FACT WHICH COME TO LIGHT IN THE COURSE OF THE WRITTEN PROCEDURE . AS PORTO NOGARO HAS FAILED TO ESTABLISH THAT THE SECOND SUBMISSION IS BASED ON SUCH MATTERS, THAT SUBMISSION MUST BE REJECTED AS INADMISSIBLE .  IT FOLLOWS FROM THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS THAT THE APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION OF OCTOBER MUST BE DISMISSED .  IN SUPPORT OF ITS APPLICATION FOR A REDUCTION IN THE FINE, PORTO NOGARO PUTS FORWARD SEVERAL ARGUMENTS .  IN THE FIRST PLACE, IT MAINTAINS THAT THE PRODUCTION IN EXCESS OF ITS QUOTA FOR REINFORCING BARS WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FACT THAT IT HAD MISREAD ITS OWN PRODUCTION RECORDS .  THAT ARGUMENT CANNOT BE ACCEPTED, SINCE PORTO NOGARO MAY NOT RELY ON ITS OWN CONDUCT IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY ITS FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ITS PRODUCTION QUOTA .  NEXT, PORTO NOGARO MAINTAINS THAT IT WAS UNFAIR TO IMPOSE PENALTIES ON IT FOR EXCESS PRODUCTION AND DELIVERIES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF SINCE NO SUCH EXCESS WOULD HAVE OCCURRED IF, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICANT' S REQUEST, THE COMMISSION HAD AUTHORIZED IT TO CARRY FORWARD TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE UNUSED PORTIONS OF ITS QUOTAS . PORTO NOGARO ARGUES THAT, IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EXPRESS REFUSAL, IT COULD BELIEVE IN GOOD FAITH THAT ITS REQUEST HAD BEEN ACCEPTED .  THOSE ARGUMENTS ARE IRRELEVANT IN SO FAR AS THE CATEGORY OF REINFORCING BARS IS CONCERNED . WITH REGARD TO THAT CATEGORY, THE COMMISSION IMPOSED PENALTIES ONLY IN REGARD TO THE EXCESS PRODUCTION WHICH WOULD STILL HAVE OCCURRED IF THE COMMISSION HAD AUTHORIZED THE APPLICANT TO CARRY FORWARD ITS QUOTAS TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF . MOREOVER, THE ARGUMENTS ARE UNFOUNDED IN SO FAR AS THE CATEGORY OF MERCHANT BARS IS CONCERNED . THE COMMISSION REDUCED PORTO NOGARO' S QUOTAS FOR THAT CATEGORY BY ITS DECISION OF MARCH .  FINALLY, PORTO NOGARO ARGUES THAT THE FINE SHOULD BE REDUCED BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IT HAS INFRINGED THE LEGISLATION IN QUESTION .  THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF COMMISSION DECISION NO 1696/82/ECSC OF JUNE ON THE EXTENSION OF THE SYSTEM OF MONITORING AND PRODUCTION QUOTAS FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS OF UNDERTAKINGS IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL 1982, L 191, P.*) PROVIDES THAT THE FINE SHOULD GENERALLY BE ECU FOR EACH TONNE IN EXCESS; THE SECOND PARAGRAPH PROVIDES THAT, IN THE EVENT OF A FRESH INFRINGEMENT, THE FINE MAY BE UP TO DOUBLE THAT AMOUNT PER TONNE . IT FOLLOWS FROM THAT PROVISION THAT THE RATE NORMALLY APPLICABLE IN THE EVENT OF A FIRST INFRINGEMENT IS ECU . MOREOVER, IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND THAT IN THIS CASE THE RATE OF THE FINE WAS FIXED AT ONLY ECU PER TONNE OF EXCESS, IN VIEW OF THE "UNCERTAINTY PREVAILING IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTER OF WITH REGARD TO THE EXTENSION OF THE QUOTA SYSTEM ". IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, PORTO NOGARO' S FINAL ARGUMENT MUST ALSO BE REJECTED .  ACCORDINGLY, THE FINE IMPOSED ON PORTO NOGARO SHOULD NOT BE REDUCED .  IT FOLLOWS FROM THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS THAT THE APPLICATION MUST BE DISMISSED IN ITS ENTIRETY .
