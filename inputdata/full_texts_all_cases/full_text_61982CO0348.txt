APPLICATION TO SUSPEND THE OPERATION OF COMMISSION DECISION C() 1631/OF NOVEMBER CONCERNING A FINE IMPOSED ON THE APPLICANT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY , 
Grounds
ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY ACTIONS BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT DO NOT HAVE SUSPENSORY EFFECT . THE COURT MAY , HOWEVER , IF IT CONSIDERS THAT CICRCUMSTANCES SO REQUIRE , ORDER THAT APPLICATION OF THE CONTESTED DECISION BE SUSPENDED AND MAY PRESCRIBE ANY OTHER NECESSARY INTERIM MEASURES .   ALTHOUGH THE COMMISSION CONTENDS THAT THE COURT SHOULD DISMISS THE APPLICATION IT IS CLEAR FROM ITS WRITTEN AND ORAL SUBMISSIONS THAT IT DOES NOT     OBJECT TO THE MAKING OF THE ORDER FOR SUSPENSION PROVIDED THAT THE APPLICANT PRODUCES A BANK GUARANTEE FOR PAYMENT OF THE FINE , IF IT REMAINS PAYABLE , TOGETHER WITH DEFAULT INTEREST IF APPROPRIATE . IN ADOPTING THIS VIEW THE COMMISSION IS ABIDING BY A COURSE OF ACTION WHICH IT ADOPTED IN AND WHICH MAY BE REGARDED AS JUSTIFIED PROVIDED THAT CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN IN APPROPRIATE CASES TO THE QUESTION WHETHER THERE ARE SPECIAL REASONS WHY IT SHOULD NOT BE FOLLOWED . THE APPLICANT , HOWEVER , HAS NOT SUBMITTED ANY ARGUMENT SHOWING SPECIAL REASONS FOR THE SETTING-ASIDE OF THE PROVISO TO WHICH THE COMMISSION WISHES THE SUSPENSION TO BE SUBJECTED . THERE ARE THEREFORE NO GROUNDS FOR DEPARTING FROM THAT CONDITION .
