IN CASE 88/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE CORTE SUPREMA DI CASSAZIONE ( SUPREME COURT OF CASSATION ) FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE PROCEEDINGS PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  AMMINISTRAZIONE DELLE FINANZE ( FINANCE ADMINISTRATION ), IN THE PERSON OF THE MINISTER ,   AND  ARMANDO AND OTTAVIO LEONELLI  
Subject of the case
FOR A PRELIMINARY RULLING ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 71/OF FEBRUARY ON HEALTH PROBLEMS AFFECTING TRADE IN FRESH POULTRYMEAT ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ), 
Grounds
BY ORDER DATED MAY , RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON MARCH , THE CORTE SUPREMA DI CASSAZIONE ( SUPREME COURT OF CASSATION ) REFERRED A QUESTION TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 71/OF FEBRUARY ON HEALTH PROBLEMS AFFECTING TRADE IN FRESH POULTRYMEAT ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ).   THE QUESTION WAS RAISED IN PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY ARMANDO AND OTTAVIO LEONELLI AGAINST THE ITALIAN AMMINISTRAZIONE DELLE FINANZE FOR AN ORDER THAT THE AMMINISTRAZIONE REFUND SUMS PAID AS CHARGES FOR HEALTH INSPECTIONS IN RESPECT OF IMPORTS OF INTER ALIA LIVE POULTRY AND FRESH POULTRYMEAT FROM HUNGARY , MADE BETWEEN AND . MESSRS . LEONELLI CLAIMED THAT THE SAID CHARGES HAD BEEN LEVIED IN BREACH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO     123/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN POULTRYMEAT ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION , P . ). SAVE AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THE REGULATION OR WHERE DEROGATION THEREFROM IS DECIDED UPON BY THE COUNCIL , THAT PROVISION PROHIBITS INTER ALIA THE LEVYING OF ANY CUSTOMS DUTY OR CHARGE HAVING EQUIVALENT EFFECT ON IMPORTS OF POULTRYMEAT FROM NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES .   ARTICLE OF THE AFORESAID COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 71/PROVIDES , HOWEVER , THAT : ' ' UNTIL THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF COMMUNITY PROVISIONS CONCERNING IMPORTS OF FRESH POULTRYMEAT FROM THIRD COUNTRIES , MEMBER STATES SHALL APPLY TO SUCH IMPORTS PROVISIONS WHICH ARE AT LEAST EQUIVALENT TO THOSE OF THIS DIRECTIVE . ' '   UNDER ARTICLE OF THE SAME DIRECTIVE THE MEMBER STATES WERE REQUIRED TO BRING INTO FORCE THE LAWS , REGULATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THE DIRECTIVE IN RESPECT OF INTRA-COMMUNITY TRADE WITHIN TWO YEARS FOLLOWING NOTIFICATION OF THE DIRECTIVE .   THE CORTE SUPREMA DI CASSAZIONE , TAKING THE VIEW THAT ITS JUDGMENT DEPENDED UPON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE AFORESAID PROVISIONS OF COMMUNITY LAW AND IN PARTICULAR THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THOSE PROVISIONS , THEREUPON STAYED THE PROCEEDINGS AND PUT TO THE COURT THE FOLLOWING QUESTION :    ' ' IS ARTICLE OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 71/118/EEC ON HEALTH PROBLEMS AFFECTING TRADE IN FRESH POULTRYMEAT TO BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT THE DEROGATION PROVIDED FOR THEREIN FROM THE PROHIBITION OF THE LEVYING OF CUSTOMS DUTIES , OTHER THAN THOSE SPECIFIED IN THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF , AND NATIONAL CHARGES HAVING EQUIVALENT EFFECT ( A PROHIBITION LAID DOWN BY REGULATION NO 123/67/EEC OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN POULTRYMEAT ) AND , THEREFORE , THE RIGHT OF EACH MEMBER STATE TO CONTINUE TO LEVY SUCH CHARGES ARE SUBJECT TO THE ADDITIONAL CONDITION THAT THE MEMBER STATE IN QUESTION HAS ALREADY ADOPTED THE LAWS , REGULATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH THE AFORESAID DIRECTIVE?  ' '   THAT QUESTION BASICALLY ASKS WHETHER AS REGARDS IMPORTS OF FRESH POULTRYMEAT FROM NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES THE DEROGATION CONTAINED IN ARTICLE OF DIRECTIVE 71/TO THE PROHIBITION OF LEVYING CUSTOMS DUTIES OR CHARGES HAVING AN EQUIVALENT EFFECT IN ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 123/APPLIES     FROM NOTIFICATION OF THE SAID DIRECTIVE TO THE PARTICULAR MEMBER STATE IN QUESTION OR WHETHER ITS APPLICATION DEPENDS ON THE ADDITIONAL CONDITION THAT THE MEMBER STATE HAS ALREADY ADOPTED THE MEASURES NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE SAID DIRECTIVE .   AS THE COURT FOUND IN THE JUDGMENT OF JANUARY IN CASE 30/WIGEI ( ) ECR , ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 123/IN FACT PROHIBITS , SUBJECT TO ANY DEROGATION DECIDED BY THE COUNCIL , THE LEVYING , IN TRADE WITH NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES IN FRESH POULTRYMEAT , OF CUSTOMS DUTIES OTHER THAN THOSE LAID DOWN BY THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF OR DOMESTIC CHARGES HAVING EQUIVALENT EFFECT . ACCORDING TO ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW OF THE COURT THE CONCEPT OF CHARGE HAVING AN EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO A CUSTOMS DUTY COVERS ALL PECUNIARY CHARGES , WHATEVER THEIR AMOUNT , IMPOSED BY REASON OF VETERINARY OR PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTIONS OF ANIMALS AND MEAT IMPORTED FROM NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES , UNLESS THEY RELATE TO A GENERAL SYSTEM OF INTERNAL TAXATION APPLIED SYSTEMATICALLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SAME CRITERIA AND AT THE SAME STAGE OF MARKETING TO DOMESTIC AND IMPORTED PRODUCTS ALIKE .   THE DEROGATION TO THAT PROHIBITION INTRODUCED BY ARTICLE OF DIRECTIVE 71/IS INTENDED , AS THE COURT HAS ALSO ALREADY FOUND IN ITS AFORESAID JUDGMENT OF JANUARY , TO LAY DOWN , ON A PROVISIONAL BASIS PENDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMMUNITY SYSTEM OF HEALTH INSPECTION OF IMPORTS OF FRESH MEAT FROM NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES , A RULE APPLICABLE TO THE NATIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR HEALTH INSPECTION REMAINING IN FORCE . THE OBJECT OF THE RULE IS TO ENSURE THAT INSPECTIONS EFFECTED ON IMPORTS FROM NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES AND CHARGES LEVIED IN RESPECT OF SUCH INSPECTIONS SHOULD NOT BE MORE FAVOURABLE THAN THOSE WHICH APPLY UNDER THE DIRECTIVE TO INTRA-COMMUNITY TRADE AND THUS THE RULE SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT TRADERS WHO PUT ON THE MARKET FRESH MEAT ORIGINATING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY ARE NOT TREATED LESS FAVOURABLY THAN THEIR COMPETITORS WHO IMPORT MEAT FROM NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES .   IT IS APPARENT FROM THE ACTUAL WORDING OF ARTICLE OF DIRECTIVE 71/AND ITS POSITION WITHIN THE DIRECTIVE THAT THE OBLIGATION WHICH IT IMPOSES ON MEMBER STATES TO SUBJECT IMPORTS FROM NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES TO THEIR NATIONAL SYSTEMS , BEING AT LEAST AS STRICT AND EXACTING AS THE SYSTEM IMPOSED     BY THE DIRECTIVE IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE CONDITION THAT THE NECESSARY MEASURES HAVE ALREADY BEEN TAKEN TO COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE DIRECTIVE AND DOES NOT DEPEND ON ANY CONDITION OTHER THAN THAT OF NOTIFICATION OF THE DIRECTIVE TO THE MEMBER STATE .   THAT IDEA IS CONSISTENT WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROVISION IN QUESTION , THE EFFICACY OF WHICH WOULD BE COMPROMISED IF THE DEROGATION THEREIN CONTAINED WERE TO APPLY ONLY AFTER THE MEMBER STATE IN QUESTION HAS COMPLIED WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE DIRECTIVE . IF SUCH AN INTERPRETATION WERE ACCEPTED PRODUCTS FROM NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES WOULD BE ABLE TO ENTER THE COMMUNITY THROUGH A MEMBER STATE WHICH HAD NOT YET COMPLIED AND CIRCULATE FREELY WITHOUT HAVING TO BEAR THE COSTS RELATING TO THEIR HEALTH INSPECTION EVEN THOUGH OTHER MEMBER STATES HAD ALREADY COMPLIED WITH THE DIRECTIVE . THAT WOULD PENALIZE IMPORTS FROM THE LATTER MEMBER STATES NOT ONLY IN RELATION TO PRODUCTS FROM THE MEMBER STATE IN QUESTION BUT ALSO AS REGARDS PRODUCTS FRON NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES IMPORTED INTO THE COMMUNITY THROUGH THAT MEMBER STATE AND WOULD BE CONTRARY TO THE PRINCIPLE OF COMMUNITY PREFERENCE .   IT SHOULD BE ADDED THAT THE DEROGATION CONTAINED IN ARTICLE OF DIRECTIVE 71/APPLIES ONLY TO IMPORTS OF FRESH POULTRYMEAT AND NOT TO LIVE POULTRY AS IS CLEARLY APPARENT BOTH FROM THE WORDING OF THE PROVISION AND THE OBJECTIVE OF THE SAID DIRECTIVE AS DEFINED IN ARTICLE THEREOF .   THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION PUT BY THE CORTE SUPREMA DI CASSAZIONE SHOULD THEREFORE BE THAT AS REGARDS IMPORTS OF FRESH POULTRYMEAT FROM NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES THE DEROGATION INTRODUCED BY ARTICLE OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 71/OF FEBRUARY FROM THE PROHIBITION OF THE LEVYING OF CUSTOMS DUTIES AND CHARGES HAVING EQUIVALENT EFFECT CONTAINED IN ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 123/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE APPLIES FROM THE DATE OF THE NOTIFICATION OF THE SAID DIRECTIVE TO THE MEMBER STATE IN QUESTION , WHETHER OR NOT THAT MEMBER STATE HAS ALREADY ADOPTED THE NECESSARY MEASURES TO COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE DIRECTIVE .
