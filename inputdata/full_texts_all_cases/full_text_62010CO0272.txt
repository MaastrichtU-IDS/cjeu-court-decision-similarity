Operative part
1.
	Article 155(2) TFEU and the Framework Agreement on fixed-term work concluded on March 1999, which is annexed to Council
                     Directive 1999/70/EC of June concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work concluded by ETUC, UNICE and CEEP,
                     must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation, such as Article 11(2) of Presidential Decree No 164/laying
                     down provisions concerning workers employed under fixed-term contracts in the public sector, which provides that an application
                     by a worker to convert a succession of fixed‑term employment contracts that may be considered to constitute an abuse into
                     an employment contract of indefinite duration must be made to the competent authority within a time-limit of two months from
                     the date of entry into force of that decree, provided that that time-limit is not less favourable than that governing similar
                     domestic actions regarding employment law and does not render impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred
                     by Union law, which it is for the referring court to determine.
                  
2.
	Clause 8(3) of the Framework Agreement on fixed-term work must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation, such
                     as Article 11(2) of Presidential Decree No 164/2004, which provides that an application by a worker to convert a succession
                     of fixed-term employment contracts that may be considered to constitute an abuse into an employment contract of indefinite
                     duration must be made to the competent authority within a time‑limit of two months from the date of entry into force of that
                     decree, whereas the corresponding time-limits laid down by similar national legislative measures which preceded that date
                     were extended, in so far as that legislation does not affect the general level of protection afforded to fixed-term workers.
