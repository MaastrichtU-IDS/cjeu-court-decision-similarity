Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 71/305/EEC OF JULY CONCERNING THE COORDINATION OF PROCEDURES FOR THE AWARD OF PUBLIC WORKS CONTRACTS ( OJ , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P . , 
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE REGISTRY ON FEBRUARY THE COMMISSION HAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY AN ACTION SEEKING A DECLARATION THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER DIRECTIVE NO 71/305/EEC OF THE COUNCIL OF JULY ( OJ , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION , ( II ), P . ).   IN CONJUNCTION WITH DIRECTIVE NO 71/304/EEC OF THE SAME DATE CONCERNING THE ABOLITION OF RESTRICTIONS ON FREEDOM TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN RESPECT OF PUBLIC WORKS CONTRACTS , DIRECTIVE NO 71/305/EEC SEEKS TO COORDINATE THE NATIONAL PROCEDURES FOR THE AWARD OF THESE CONTRACTS . UNDER ARTICLE MEMBER STATES WERE TO ADOPT THE MEASURES NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THE DIRECTIVE WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS OF ITS NOTIFICATION TO THEM , WHICH PERIOD EXPIRED ON JULY .    SUBSEQUENT TO THIS DIRECTIVE THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC ADOPTED THE LAW OF FEBRUARY RELATING TO THE PROCEDURES FOR THE AWARD OF PUBLIC CONTRACTS BY RESTRICTED INVITATION TO TENDER ( LICITAZIONE PRIVATA ) THE TEXT OF WHICH WAS CONVEYED TO THE COMMISSION ON AUGUST .   IN APPLICATION OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY THE COMMISSION , HOWEVER , INFORMED THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC BY LETTER OF JUNE THAT IT CONSIDERED THAT THE OBLIGATIONS ARISING FROM THE ABOVEMENTIONED DIRECTIVE HAD NOT BEEN SATISFIED BY THE ADOPTION OF THE LAW .   IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WAS CLAIMED THAT THE DEFENDANT HAD EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE OF THE LAW PROCEDURES FOR THE AWARD OF PUBLIC WORKS CONTRACTS OTHER THAN BY RESTRICTED INVITATION TO TENDER .   SECONDLY , IT WAS ALLEGED THAT THE DEFENDANT HAD NOT COMPLIED WITH ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE WHEREBY THE ITALIAN ' ANONYMOUS ENVELOPE '  PROCEDURE HAD TO BE ABOLISHED BY JULY OR JULY ACCORDING TO THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE CONTRACT AS THE ITALIAN LAW OF FEBRUARY MADE NO PROVISION IN THIS RESPECT .   IN ADDITION , UNDER ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE , AUTHORITIES AWARDING CONTRACTS WHO WISH TO AWARD A PUBLIC WORKS CONTRACT BY OPEN OR RESTRICTED PROCEDURE MUST MAKE THEIR INTENTION KNOWN BY MEANS OF A NOTICE PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNITIES WHEREAS THE ITALIAN LAW LIMITS ITSELF TO PROVIDING FOR THE PUBLICATION OF A NOTICE IN THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC .   THE ITALIAN LAW DOES NOT CONTAIN THE PROVISIONS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLES , , AND OF THE DIRECTIVE CONCERNING THE TIME-LIMIT FOR THE RECEIPT OF REQUESTS TO PARTICIPATE , THE FORM REQUIRED FOR TENDERS AND THE COMPULSORY INDICATION OF THE TIME-LIMIT FOR THE COMPLETION OF THE WORKS PUT OUT TO TENDER .   FINALLY , ARTICLES , , AND OF THE DIRECTIVE LAY DOWN THE CRITERIA FOR QUALITATIVE SELECTION WHICH ALLOW CERTAIN UNDERTAKINGS TO BE EXCLUDED FROM PARTICIPATION IN THE CONTRACTS , WHILE THE ITALIAN LAW CONTAINS NO PROVISION TO THIS EFFECT AND RETAINS THE WIDE DISCRETION CONFERRED ON AUTHORITIES AWARDING CONTRACTS BY ARTICLE OF THE ROYAL DECREE OF MAY .    THE DEFENDANT DID NOT CONTEST THE ALLEGED FAILURES AND , ON JULY , CONVEYED TO THE COMMISSION A PRELIMINARY DRAFT OF A BILL ' CONTAINING THE COMMUNITY RULES IN FULL . '   THE DRAFT , WHICH ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSION SATISFIES THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE DIRECTIVE , WAS CONVEYED TO THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT ON AUGUST BUT HAS STILL NOT BEEN ADOPTED WITH THE RESULT THAT THE MEASURES INTENDED TO ENSURE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DIRECTIVE ARE NOT YET IN FORCE AT THE DATE OF THIS JUDGMENT .   ARTICLE OF THE TREATY PROVIDES THAT A DIRECTIVE SHALL BE BINDING , AS TO THE RESULT TO BE ACHIEVED , UPON EACH MEMBER STATE TO WHICH IT IS ADDRESSED BUT LEAVES TO THE NATIONAL AUTHORITIES THE CHOICE OF FORM AND METHODS .   THE MANDATORY NATURE OF DIRECTIVES ENTAILS THE OBLIGATION FOR ALL MEMBER STATES TO COMPLY WITH THE TIME-LIMITS CONTAINED THEREIN IN ORDER THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION SHALL BE ACHIEVED UNIFORMLY WITHIN THE WHOLE COMMUNITY .   IT FOLLOWS THAT AS THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO ADOPT , WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD , THE MEASURES NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH DIRECTIVE NO 71/305/EEC OF THE COUNCIL CONCERNING THE COORDINATION OF PROCEDURES FOR THE AWARD OF PUBLIC WORKS CONTRACTS , IT HAS FAILED TO FULFIL AN OBLIGATION UNDER THE TREATY .
