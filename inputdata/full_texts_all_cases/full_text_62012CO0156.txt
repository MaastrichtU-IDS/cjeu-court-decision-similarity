Re:
Request for a preliminary ruling — Landesgericht Salzburg — Interpretation of the first sentence of Article 51(1) and of Article of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union or, in the alternative, of Article 43(1) of Council Regulation
                  (EC) No 44/of December on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial
                  matters (OJ L 12, p. 1) and of Article 6(1) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms —
                  Scope of the Charter of Fundamental Rights — Procedure for enforcement of a ruling made in another Member State — Right to
                  legal aid — Whether national legislation refusing that right to legal persons is lawful.
               
Operative part 
The action, brought under Article of Council Regulation (EC) No 44/of December on jurisdiction and the recognition
         and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, in order to contest a decision holding that a seizure order
         was enforceable under Articles to of that regulation and making attachment orders constitutes implementation of European
         Union law for the purposes of Article of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
      
The principle of effective judicial protection, as enshrined in Article of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European
         Union, may include the right to be exempted from payment of procedural costs and/or fees due for obtaining the assistance
         of a lawyer in respect of such an action.
      
However, it is for the national court to ascertain whether the conditions for grant of such aid constitute a restriction of
         the right of access to courts and tribunals which infringes the very essence of that right, whether they pursue a legitimate
         aim and whether there is a reasonable degree of proportionality between the means used and the aim pursued.
      
In carrying out that assessment, the national court may take into consideration the subject-matter of the dispute, any reasonable
         chances of the applicant’s success, the gravity of what is at stake for him, the complexity of the law and procedure applicable
         and the ability of the applicant effectively to defend his cause. In order to assess the proportionality, the national court
         may also take into account the extent of the procedural costs to be advanced and whether or not they constitute an insurmountable
         obstacle to access to justice.
      
Having regard more specifically to legal persons, the national court may take account of their situation. Thus, it may take
         into consideration, in particular, the legal form of the legal person in question and whether it is for profit or not and
         the financial capabilities of its members or shareholders and whether it is possible for them to obtain the sums necessary
         to bring the court proceedings.
