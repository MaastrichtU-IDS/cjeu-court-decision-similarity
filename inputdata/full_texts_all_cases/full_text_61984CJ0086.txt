Parties
IN JOINED CASES AND 87/REFERENCES TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE ECONOMISCHE POLITIERECHTER ( MAGISTRATE DEALING WITH COMMERCIAL OFFENCES ) AT THE ARRONDISSEMENTSRECHTBANK ( DISTRICT COURT ) MIDDELBURG FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST  I . BOUT EN ZONEN BV ,   
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 171/OF JANUARY LAYING DOWN CERTAIN TECHNICAL MEASURES FOR THE CONSERVATION OF FISHERY RESOURCES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), 
Grounds
BY TWO ORDERS DATED MARCH , WHICH WERE RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON MARCH , THE ECONOMISCHE POLITIERECHTER ( MAGISTRATE DEALING WITH COMMERCIAL OFFENCES ) AT THE ARRONDISSEMENTSRECHTBANK ( DISTRICT COURT ) MIDDELBURG REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY A QUESTION ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 171/OF JANUARY LAYING DOWN CERTAIN TECHNICAL MEASURES FOR THE CONSERVATION OF FISHERY RESOURCES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P.).   THAT QUESTION WAS RAISED IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT AGAINST I.BOUT EN ZONEN BV . THAT COMPANY IS CHARGED WITH HAVING INFRINGED ARTICLE ( ) OF COUNCIL REGULATION NO 171/BY FISHING FOR SOLE OR PLAICE , OR BOTH , WITH BEAM TRAWLS WITHIN THE 12-MILE ZONE ALONG THE NETHERLANDS COAST FROM A VESSEL EXCEEDING GRT ( GROSS REGISTERED TONNAGE ).   SINCE THE QUESTION RAISED IN THE TWO ORDERS FOR REFERENCE WAS IDENTICAL , THE COURT , BY ORDER OF SEPTEMBER , JOINED THE CASES FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE PROCEDURE AND THE JUDGMENT .   THE MAGISTRATE DEALING WITH COMMERCIAL OFFENCES AT THE ARRONDISSEMENTSRECHTBANK MIDDELBURG , BEFORE WHOM THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS WERE BROUGHT , POINTS OUT THAT IT IS NOT CLEAR FROM COUNCIL REGULATION NO 171/HOW OR UNDER WHICH PROVISIONS THE GRT ARE TO BE CALCULATED . HE THEN STATES THAT THE METHOD OF MEASURING TONNAGE LAID DOWN BY THE OSLO CONVENTION OF JUNE , INTRODUCING A UNIFORM SYSTEM FOR MEASURING THE TONNAGE OF SHIPS , WHICH WAS APPLIED UNDER NETHERLANDS LEGISLATION AT THE MATERIAL TIME , MAY CAUSE THE GRT TONNAGE OF IDENTICAL FISHING VESSELS HAVING THE SAME BASIC DIMENSIONS TO VARY , NOT ON THE BASIS OF DISPLACEMENT , SPEED OR TRUE CAPACITY BUT ON THE BASIS OF THE BREADTH OF THE RIBS AND OF THE FLOOR     PLATE . IT IS THEREFORE POSSIBLE FOR FISHING VESSELS OF THE SAME NATURE AND TYPE TO BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY . IN HIS VIEW , THIS MIGHT GIVE RISE TO DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT BETWEEN NETHERLANDS VESSELS , SOME BEING PERMITTED TO FISH IN THE COASTAL WATERS WHILST OTHER IDENTICAL VESSELS ARE NOT . THAT POSSIBILITY INDUCED HIM TO PUT THE FOLLOWING QUESTION TO THE COURT :    ' HOW IS THE TONNAGE OF FISHING VESSELS TO BE DETERMINED FOR THE PURPOSES OF COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 171/OF JANUARY LAYING DOWN CERTAIN TECHNICAL MEASURES FOR THE CONSERVATION OF FISHERY RESOURCES?  '   AS THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES AND THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT RIGHTLY POINT OUT , THERE IS NO PROVISION OF COMMUNITY LAW DEFINING THE METHOD OF CALCULATING THE GRT REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE ( ) OF COUNCIL REGULATION NO 171/. SINCE THERE ARE NO COMMUNITY RULES , THE MEMBER STATES MUST THEMSELVES DECIDE WHICH METHOD OF CALCULATION IS USED .   WITH REGARD TO THE FEARS OF UNEQUAL TREATMENT OF IDENTICAL VESSELS EXPRESSED BY THE COURT MAKING THE REFERENCE , IT NEED ONLY BE STATED THAT THAT POSSIBILITY DOES NOT ARISE FROM THE LIMIT OF GRT LAID DOWN BY COUNCIL REGULATION NO 171/BUT SOLELY FROM THE METHOD OF CALCULATION PRESCRIBED BY NATIONAL LAW .   THE REPLY TO THE QUESTION RAISED BY THE ECONOMISCHE POLITIERECHTER AT THE ARRONDISSEMENTSRECHTBANK MIDDELBURG MUST THEREFORE BE THAT , IN THE PRESENT STATE OF COMMUNITY LAW , THE METHOD OF CALCULATING THE GRT LAID DOWN AS A MAXIMUM TONNAGE IN ARTICLE ( ) OF COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 171/OF JANUARY , LAYING DOWN CERTAIN TECHNICAL MEASURES FOR THE CONSERVATION OF FISHERY RESOURCES , MUST BE DETERMINED BY THE MEMBER STATES .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES AND THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT , WHICH HAVE SUBMITTED OBSERVATIONS TO THE COURT , ARE NOT RECOVERABLE . SINCE THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE , IN SO FAR AS THE PARTIES TO THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS ARE CONCERNED , IN THE NATURE OF A STEP IN THE PROCEEDINGS PENDING BEFORE THE NATIONAL COURT , THE DECISION ON COSTS IS A MATTER FOR THAT COURT .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ( FIRST CHAMBER ),   IN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION REFERRED TO IT BY THE ECONOMISCHE POLITIERECHTER AT THE ARRONDISSEMENTSRECHTBANK MIDDELBURG BY TWO ORDERS DATED MARCH , HEREBY RULES :   IN THE PRESENT STATE OF COMMUNITY LAW , THE METHOD OF CALCULATING THE GRT LAID DOWN AS A MAXIMUM TONNAGE IN ARTICLE ( ) OF COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 171/OF JANUARY , LAYING DOWN CERTAIN TECHNICAL MEASURES FOR THE CONSERVATION OF FISHERY RESOURCES , MUST BE DETERMINED BY THE MEMBER STATES .
