                  Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/of the European Parliament and of the Council (‘Unfair Commercial Practices Directive’)

Operative part
Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of May concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial
         practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC and Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC
         of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/of the European Parliament and of the Council
         (‘Unfair Commercial Practices Directive’) must be interpreted as precluding a national provision, such as that at issue in
         the main proceedings, which lays down a general prohibition of announcements of price reductions or announcements suggesting
         such reductions during the period preceding sales, in so far as that provision pursues objectives relating to consumer protection.
