Grounds
THE FUTURE OF KC COULD BE IRREPARABLY DAMAGED IF THE DECISION TAKEN WAS IMMEDIATELY PUT INTO EFFECT, SINCE THERE IS NO READY SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE RISKS INVOLVED FOR THE EXPLOITATION OF THE MINE AND THOSE RELATING TO THE HURRIED RECONVERSION OF THE UNDERTAKING .  IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT SUCH A RECONVERSION WOULD BE IRREVERSIBLE .  BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBILITIES OFFERED BY THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COURT THE SETTLEMENT OF THE MAIN ACTION CAN BE EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE WITHIN A SHORT TIME .  
Decision on costs
AT THIS STAGE, IT IS APPROPRIATE TO RESERVE COSTS . 
Operative part
THE PRESIDENT  AS AN INTERIM RULING,  ORDERS  . THE OPERATION OF ARTICLE OF THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION OF DECEMBER ( IV/795-OJEC OF JANUARY ) IS SUSPENDED UNTIL JULY .  . THE COSTS ARE RESERVED .
