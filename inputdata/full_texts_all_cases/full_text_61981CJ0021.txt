Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2527/OF SEPTEMBER LAYING DOWN TECHNICAL MEASURES FOR THE CONSERVATION OF FISHERY RESOURCES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ) AND AS TO THE COMPATIBILITY WITH COMMUNITY LAW OF MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE BELGIAN ROYAL DECREE OF APRIL LAYING DOWN MEASURES FOR THE PROTECTION OF RESOURCES IN FISH , CRUSTACEANS AND MOLLUSCS IN THE BELGIAN FISHING ZONE , AS AMENDED BY THE ROYAL DECREE OF DECEMBER LAYING DOWN SIMILAR TEMPORARY MEASURES IN RESPECT OF THE NORTH SEA , 
Grounds
BY JUDGMENT OF JANUARY , RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON FEBRUARY , THE RECHTBANK VAN EERSTE AANLEG ( COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE ), BRUGES , REFERRED TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING TWO QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE INTERPRETATION , IN THE LIGHT OF THE BELGIAN MEASURES RELATING TO FISHERIES , OF ARTICLE OF THE ACT CONCERNING THE CONDITIONS OF ACCESSION AND THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE TREATIES OF  JANUARY AND OF COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2527/OF SEPTEMBER LAYING DOWN TECHNICAL MEASURES FOR THE CONSERVATION  OF FISHERY RESOURCES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ).       THOSE QUESTIONS WERE RAISED IN THE COURSE OF CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT AGAINST DANIEL BOUT , THE CAPTAIN OF THE NETHERLANDS FISHING VESSEL CHRISTINA , FOR OFFENCES AGAINST , INTER ALIA , THE BELGIAN KONINKLIJKE BESLUIT ( ROYAL DECREE ) OF APRIL ADOPTING MEASURES FOR THE PROTECTION OF RESOURCES OF FISH , CRUSTACEANS AND MOLLUSCS IN THE BELGIAN FISHING ZONE ( BELGISCH STAATSBLAD ( BELGIAN GAZETTE ) OF MAY AT P . ), AS AMENDED BY THE ROYAL DECREE OF DECEMBER ADOPTING SIMILAR TEMPORARY MEASURES  IN RESPECT OF THE NORTH SEA ( BELGISCH STAATSBLAD ( BELGIAN GAZETTE ) OF  FEBRUARY AT P . ). THE FORMER DECREE PROHIBITED , INTER ALIA , FISHING FOR SOLE AND PLAICE IN BELGIAN COASTAL WATERS WITH A VESSEL HAVING A GROSS REGISTERED TONNAGE ( GRT ) OF MORE THAN REGISTERED TONNES , AS WELL AS THE USE OF DOUBLE-TWINE NETS WITH AN AVERAGE MESH-SIZE SMALLER THAN MM . THE LATTER DECREE , OF DECEMBER , RAISED THE MINIMUM MESH-SIZE FROM TO MM .   ON MAY THE FISHING VESSEL CHRISTINA , HAVING A TONNAGE OF GRT , FISHED FOR SOLE AND PLAICE IN BELGIAN COASTAL WATERS USING A DOUBLE-TWINE NET HAVING A MESH-SIZE OF MORE THAN MM BUT LESS THAN MM .   IN THE COURSE OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS , THE ACCUSED CLAIMED THAT THE AFOREMENTIONED COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2527/OF SEPTEMBER , WHICH ENTERED INTO FORCE ON OCTOBER , CONTAINED PROVISIONS MORE FAVOURABLE TO HIM INASMUCH AS IT RAISED THE TONNAGE LIMIT TO GRT AND FIXED THE MINIMUM MESH-SIZE FOR DOUBLE-TWINE NETS AT MM . CONSIDERING THAT A RULING OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE WAS NECESSARY NOT MERELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ADJUDICATING UPON THAT SUBMISSION BUT ALSO AND ABOVE ALL OF JUDGING WHETHER THE BELGIAN MEASURES MENTIONED ABOVE WERE COMPATIBLE WITH COMMUNITY LAW , THE RECHTBANK VAN EERSTE AANLEG REQUESTED THE COURT TO GIVE A PRELIMINARY RULING ON THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS :    ' ' . DID THE MEMBER STATES AT THE TIME OF THE OCCURRENCES SUBMITTED FOR JUDGMENT TO THIS COURT REMAIN COMPETENT TO ENACT PROVISIONS FOR THE LIMITATION OF FISHING SUCH AS THOSE EMBODIED IN THE ROYAL DECREE OF  APRIL LAYING DOWN MEASURES FOR THE PROTECTION OF RESOURCES IN FISH , CRUSTACEANS AND MULLOSCS IN THE BELGIAN FISHING ZONE ( BELGISCH STAATSBLAD ( BELGIAN GAZETTE ) OF MAY ) AND WERE THEY ENTITLED TO ENFORCE COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH PROVISIONS WITHIN THE ZONE COMING WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION HAVING REGARD TO ARTICLES , , TO OF THE EEC     TREATY OF MARCH , ARTICLE OF THE ACT OF ACCESSION AND OF REGULATIONS ( EEC ) NOS 100/AND 101/ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN FISHERY PRODUCTS AND LAYING DOWN A COMMON STRUCTURAL POLICY FOR THE FISHING INDUSTRY RESPECTIVELY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L 20)?    2.MAY RETROACTIVE EFFECT BE CONFERRED UPON COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2527/LAYING DOWN TECHNICAL MEASURES FOR THE CONSERVATION OF FISHERY RESOURCES OR ANY SUBSEQUENT REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE SAME MATTERS?  ' '  THE FIRST QUESTION   THE FIRST QUESTION INQUIRES WHETHER THE MEMBER STATES STILL RETAINED POWER AFTER DECEMBER TO ADOPT CONSERVATION MEASURES OF THE KIND CONTAINED IN THE BELGIAN ROYAL DECREES IN QUESTION .   AS THE COURT HAS ALREADY HELD IN ITS JUDGMENT OF MAY IN CASE 804/COMMISSION V UNITED KINGDOM ( ) ECR , THE POWER TO ADOPT , AS PART OF THE COMMON FISHERIES POLICY , MEASURES RELATING TO THE CONSERVATION OF THE RESOURCES OF THE SEA HAS BELONGED FULLY AND DEFINITIVELY TO THE COMMUNITIES SINCE THE EXPIRATION ON JANUARY OF THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD LAID DOWN BY ARTICLE OF THE ACT OF ACCESSION SO THAT AFTER THAT DATE THE MEMBER STATES ARE NO LONGER ENTITLED TO EXERCISE ANY POWER OF THEIR OWN IN THIS MATTER AND MAY HENCEFORTH ONLY ACT AS TRUSTEES OF THE COMMON INTEREST , IN THE ABSENCE OF APPROPRIATE ACTION ON THE PART OF THE COUNCIL .   THE COURT CONSEQUENTLY HELD THAT , IN A SITUATION CHARACTERIZED BY THE INACTION OF THE COUNCIL AND BY THE MAINTENANCE , IN PRINCIPLE , OF THE CONSERVATION MEASURES IN FORCE THE MEMBER STATES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO UNDERTAKE DETAILED CONSULTATIONS WITH THE COMMISSION AND TO SEEK ITS APPROVAL IN GOOD FAITH AND ALSO A DUTY NOT TO LAY DOWN NATIONAL CONSERVATION MEASURES IN SPITE OF OBJECTIONS , RESERVATIONS OR CONDITIONS WHICH MAY BE FORMULATED BY THE COMMISSION .       AS REGARDS THE BELGIAN ROYAL DECREE OF APRIL , IT IS APPARENT FROM THE COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION , PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES OF JUNE , ( C , P . ), THAT THE COMMISSION WAS CONSULTED CONCERNING THAT DECREE ON JANUARY AND APRIL AND THAT IT WAS APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION ON JULY . IT FOLLOWS THEREFORE THAT THE DECREE WAS ADOPTED IN CONFORMITY WITH THOSE OBLIGATIONS OF THE MEMBER STATES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE .   HOWEVER , IT IS CLEAR FROM THE INFORMATION GIVEN BY THE COMMISSION THAT THE ROYAL DECREE OF DECEMBER WAS NOT THE SUBJECT OF CONSULTATION . A NATIONAL MEASURE ADOPTED UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS DOES NOT COMPLY WITH THE ABOVE-MENTIONED OBLIGATIONS .   THE NATIONAL COURT ALSO ASKS WHETHER THE MEMBER STATES ARE ENTITLED TO ENFORCE COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH NATIONAL PROVISIONS IN THE ZONE COMING WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION .   IN THAT RESPECT THE COURT HAS ALREADY HELD , MOST RECENTLY IN ITS JUDGMENT OF DECEMBER IN CASE 269/ROBERT TYMEN ( ) ECR ( NON-PUBLISHED ), THAT WHERE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS ARE BROUGHT BY VIRTUE OF A NATIONAL MEASURE WHICH IS HELD TO BE CONTRARY TO COMMUNITY LAW , A CONVICTION IN THOSE PROCEEDINGS IS LIKEWISE INCOMPATIBLE WITH COMMUNITY LAW . ON THE CONTRARY , IT IS FOR THE MEMBER STATE TO ENFORCE COMPLIANCE IN THE ZONE COMING WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION WITH THOSE MEASURES ADOPTED BY IT IN CONFORMITY WITH ITS COMMUNITY OBLIGATIONS .   THE REPLY TO THE FIRST QUESTION MUST ACCORDINGLY BE THAT , AFTER THE EXPIRY OF THE PERIOD REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE OF THE ACT OF ACCESSION , A MEMBER STATE DOES NOT HAVE POWER TO ADOPT AND BRING INTO FORCE , WITHOUT APPROPRIATE PRIOR CONSULTATION WITH THE COMMISSION AND IN SPITE OF OBJECTIONS , RESERVATIONS OR CONDITIONS FORMULATED BY THE COMMISSION , FISHERY CONSERVATION MEASURES OF THE KIND CONTAINED IN THE BELGIAN ROYAL DECREES OF APRIL AND DECEMBER ADOPTING MEASURES FOR THE PROTECTION OF RESOURCES IN FISH , CRUSTACEANS AND MOLLUSCS , AND THAT THE MEMBER STATE IS NOT ENTITLED TO ENFORCE COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH MEASURES IN THE ZONE COMING WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION , IF THE MEASURES HAVE NOT BEEN ADOPTED IN CONFORMITY WITH THE ABOVE-MENTIONED OBLIGATIONS .      THE SECOND QUESTION   THE SECOND QUESTION RAISES THE ISSUE WHETHER REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2527/MENTIONED ABOVE MUST BE INTERPRETED AS HAVING RETROACTIVE EFFECT . IN THAT RESPECT IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT , ACCORDING TO WELL-ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW OF THE COURT , CONFIRMED MOST RECENTLY IN THE COURT ' S JUDGMENT OF NOVEMBER IN JOINED CASES AND 217/SALUMI AND OTHERS ( ) ECR ( NON-PUBLISHED ), SUBSTANTIVE RULES OF COMMUNITY LAW MUST BE INTERPRETED , IN ORDER TO ENSURE RESPECT FOR THE PRINCIPLES OF LEGAL CERTAINTY AND THE PROTECTION OF LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION , AS APPLYING TO SITUATIONS EXISTING BEFORE THEIR ENTRY INTO FORCE ONLY IN SO FAR AS IT CLEARLY FOLLOWS FROM THEIR TERMS , OBJECTIVES OR GENERAL SCHEME THAT SUCH AN EFFECT MUST BE GIVEN TO THEM .   BY VIRTUE OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2527/, THAT REGULATION ENTERED INTO FORCE ON OCTOBER . THERE IS NOTHING IN THE REGULATION , OR IN SUBSEQUENT REGULATIONS EXTENDING ITS VALIDITY , TO JUSTIFY THE CONCLUSION THAT IT IS INTENDED TO APPLY TO SITUATIONS EXISTING PRIOR TO THAT DATE .   THE REPLY TO THE SECOND QUESTION MUST ACCORDINGLY BE THAT NEITHER COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2527/OF SEPTEMBER LAYING DOWN TECHNICAL MEASURES FOR THE CONSERVATION OF FISHERY RESOURCES NOR ANY SUBSEQUENT REGULATIONS EXTENDING ITS VALIDITY HAVE RETROACTIVE EFFECT .
