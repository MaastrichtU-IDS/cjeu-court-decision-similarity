Summary
1.Although a decision is duly notified when it is communicated to its addressee and when the addressee is able to take note of it, the onus of proof of the date on which the decision was notified lies with the party which claims that an application is out of time ( see the judgment of June in Case 108/Belfiore v Commission (( )) ECR ).  . Recruitment procedures based on Article 29() of the Staff Regulations, which authorize the appointing authority to adopt a procedure other than the competition procedure for the recruitment of Grade A and A officials and, in exceptional cases, also for recruitment to posts which require special qualifications, are not subject to any condition as to publication ( see the judgment of October in Joined Cases to 88/Marenco and Others v Commission (( )) ECR ).
