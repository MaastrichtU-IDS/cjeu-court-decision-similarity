Hewlett, Administrator,  after hearing the Opinion of the Advocate General,  makes the following  Order  
Grounds
On October 1995, the Court (Sixth Chamber) delivered a judgment in Case C-19/P.  The judgment contains an obvious slip which it is appropriate for the Court to rectify of its own motion pursuant to Article of the Rules of Procedure.  
Operative part
On those grounds,  THE COURT (Sixth Chamber)  hereby orders:  (1) Paragraph shall read as follows:  "With regard to the second limb of the objection raised, the Court found in the Almelo and Others judgment that it was inconsistent with Article of the Treaty, and likewise with Article 86, in so far as the national court had established the existence of a collective dominant position, for a regional electricity distributor to apply an exclusive purchasing clause contained in the general conditions of sale which prohibited a local distributor from importing electricity for public supply purposes. That judgment thus requires the national court to declare the clause in question null and void in the context of the contractual relationship between the parties to the main proceedings, in so far as it finds that the restriction of competition is not necessary in order to enable that undertaking to perform its task of general interest within the meaning of Article 90(2) of the Treaty."  (2) The original of this order shall be annexed to the original of the rectified judgment. A note of this order shall be made in the margin of the original of the judgment.  Luxembourg, April 1996.
