Order of the Court (Sixth Chamber) of March – Pignataro v Ufficio centrale circoscrizionale presso il Tribunale di
            Catania and Others
(Case C‑535/08)
Eligibility requirements for regional elections – Requirement of residence in the region concerned – Articles EC and EC – Fundamental rights – No link with Community law – Court clearly lacking jurisdiction
1.                     European Union citizenship – Treaty provisions – Substantive scope – Exclusion of purely internal situations (Arts EC and
            EC) (see paras 14-18, operative part 1)
2.                     Preliminary rulings – Jurisdiction of the Court – Limits – Question referred in the course of a dispute relating to the application
            of a national provision which is not within the scope of Community law – Excluded (Art. EC) (see paras 22-24, operative
            part 2)
Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Tribunale Amministrativo Regionale per la Sicilia – Interpretation of Article EU, Article
                  of the First Additional Protocol and Article of the Fourth Additional Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights
                  and Article of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights – Interpretation of Articles EC and EC –
                  Compatibility of regional legislation restricting the right of an Italian national to be nominated for election on the basis
                  of a requirement of residence in the region.
               
Operative part: 
1.
	Articles EC and EC do not preclude national legislation which, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings,
                     includes among the requirements for eligibility for election to a regional assembly, the obligation to reside in the region
                     concerned at the time when nominations are put forward. 
                  
2.
	The Court of Justice of the European Communities clearly does not have jurisdiction to reply to the first question referred
                     by the Tribunale amministrativo regionale per la Sicilia.
