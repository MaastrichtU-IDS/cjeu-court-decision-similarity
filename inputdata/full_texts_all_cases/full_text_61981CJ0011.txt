Summary
FOR A NEW FACT TO BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY THE RAISING OF A FRESH ISSUE DURING THE PROCEEDINGS THE FACT MUST NOT HAVE EXISTED OR MUST NOT HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO THE APPLICANT WHEN THE ACTION WAS COMMENCED . SINCE MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS ARE PRESUMED TO BE VALID UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE COURT  MAY DECLARE THEM INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE TREATIES ESTABLISHING THE COMMUNITIES , A JUDGMENT OF THE COURT FINDING THAT THERE IS NOTHING CAPABLE OF AFFECTING THE VALIDITY OF A MEASURE CANNOT BE REGARDED AS A MATTER ALLOWING THE RAISING OF A FRESH ISSUE IN OTHER PROCEEDINGS .

Subject of the case
APPLICATION PURSUANT TO THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGE WHICH THE APPLICANT CONSIDERS IT HAS SUFFERED AND WILL SUFFER AS A RESULT OF PROTECTIVE MEASURES AGAINST THE IMPORTATION OF DESSERT APPLES FROM CHILE , ADOPTED BY COMMISSION REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 687/OF APRIL ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), AS AMENDED BY COMMISSION REGULATIONS ( EEC ) NO 797/OF APRIL ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) AND NO 1152/OF JUNE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JANUARY THE UNDERTAKING ANTON DURBECK ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' ' DURBECK ' ' ), WHOSE REGISTERED OFFICE IS IN FRANKFURT AM MAIN , BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGE WHICH IT CONSIDERED IT HAD SUFFERED OR WOULD SUFFER AS A RESULT OF PROTECTIVE MEASURES APPLICABLE TO THE IMPORTATION OF DESSERT APPLES ORIGINATING FROM CHILE ADOPTED BY COMMISSION REGULATION NO 687/OF APRIL ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) AS AMENDED BY COMMISSION REGULATIONS NOS 797/OF APRIL ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) AND 1152/OF JUNE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ).   IN SUPPORT OF ITS ACTION DURBECK SUBMITS THAT REGULATION NO 687/, BY WHICH THE PROTECTIVE MEASURES WERE ADOPTED , AND REGULATIONS NOS 797/AND 1152/, IN SO FAR AS THEY DID NOT CONTAIN TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS OF WHICH THE APPLICANT IN PARTICULAR MIGHT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE , WERE UNLAWFUL FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS :   LACK OF LEGAL BASIS FOR THE CONCLUSION OF AGREEMENTS ON VOLUNTARY RESTRAINT ;  BREACH OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1035/IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLES , AND OF REGULATION NO 2707/;  BREACH OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE PROTECTION OF LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION ;  BREACH OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1035/IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLES AND OF THE EEC TREATY ;  BREACH OF THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF NON-DISCRIMINATION .   ON MAY IN CASE 112/THE COURT RULED , IN REPLY TO A PRELIMINARY QUESTION PUT TO IT BY THE HESSISCHES FINANZGERICHT ( FINANCE COURT , HESSE ) ON THE VALIDITY OF THE REGULATIONS , THAT : ' ' CONSIDERATION OF THE QUESTION RAISED HAS DISCLOSED NO FACTOR OF SUCH A KIND AS TO AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF COMMISSION REGULATIONS NOS 687/, 797/AND 1152/' ' .       AT THE HEARING ON NOVEMBER DURBECK STATED THAT IN VIEW OF THE JUDGMENT GIVEN BY THE COURT IN CASE 112/IT WAS ABANDONING ITS SUBMISSION IN CASE 11/THAT REGULATIONS NOS 687/, 797/AND 1152/WERE INVALID . IT NEVERTHELESS MAINTAINED ITS CLAIM FOR COMPENSATION , ARGUING THAT SOME OF THE SUBMISSIONS PLEADED IN ITS APPLICATION , IN PARTICULAR THE SUBMISSIONS BASED ON BREACH OF THE PRINCIPLES OF NON-DISCRIMINATION AND THE PROTECTION OF LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION , COULD BE RELIED UPON EVEN WITHOUT CHALLENGING THE VALIDITY OF THE AFOREMENTIONED REGULATIONS . IT ALSO PUT FORWARD A FRESH SUBMISSION RELATING TO THE POSSIBILITY OF HOLDING THE COMMUNITY LIABLE EVEN FOR LAWFUL MEASURES .   IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS NECESSARY FIRST OF ALL TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE SUBMISSIONS WHICH THE APPLICANT STATES IT IS PURSUING IN FACT CORRESPOND TO THE SUBMISSIONS MADE IN ITS APPLICATION OR WHETHER THEY ARE INDEED FRESH SUBMISSIONS RAISED IN THE COURSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS , WHICH , TO BE ACCEPTED , MUST SATISFY THE CONDITIONS LAID DOWN BY ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE . IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO EMPHASIZE THAT ANY SUBMISSION WHICH AMOUNTS TO CHALLENGING THE VALIDITY OF REGULATIONS NOS 687/, 797/AND 1152/FOR REASONS IDENTICAL TO THOSE WHICH THE COURT HAS ALREADY CONSIDERED AND DISMISSED IN ITS JUDGMENT OF MAY MUST BE REJECTED .  BREACH OF THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-DISCRIMINATION   THE APPLICANT CLAIMS THAT THE FINDING IN PARAGRAPHS TO OF THE JUDGMENT OF MAY THAT REGULATIONS NOS 797/AND 1152/WERE DESIGNED SOLELY TO ADJUST THE APPLICATION OF THE PROTECTIVE MEASURES TO GOODS ALREADY IN TRANSIT TO THE COMMUNITY WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE 3() OF REGULATION NO 2707/IS BASED PARTLY ON A FACTUAL ERROR BECAUSE IT IS IN FACT WELL KNOWN THAT THE GOODS ALLOWED TO BE IMPORTED PURSUANT TO REGULATION NO 1152/WERE NOT IN TRANSIT TO THE COMMUNITY UNTIL AFTER APRIL , BY WHICH DATE , ACCORDING TO REGULATION NO 797/, THE DESSERT APPLES OUGHT TO HAVE LEFT CHILE .   IN THIS RESPECT , DURBECK STRESSES THAT BY TELEX MESSAGE OF APRIL IT ASKED THE COMMISSION FOR AUTHORIZATION TO IMPORT BEFORE OR MAY SOME TONNES OF CHILEAN DESSERT APPLES WHICH WERE READY TO BE SHIPPED AND THE COMMISSION , THE SAME DAY , REFUSED , SAYING THAT THE GOODS REFERRED     TO IN THE APPLICANT ' S TELEX MESSAGE COULD NOT BE REGARDED AS GOODS IN TRANSIT TO THE COMMUNITY .   THE ABOVE-MENTIONED SUBMISSION WAS INCLUDED IN THE APPLICATION AND IS THEREFORE ADMISSIBLE . MOREOVER , ALTHOUGH IT AMOUNTS IN SUBSTANCE TO CHALLENGING REGULATION NO 1152/AS DISCRIMINATORY , IT IS BASED ON A FACTOR WHICH WAS NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN CASE 112/. IT IS RIGHT THEREFORE TO CONSIDER THE SUBMISSION IN THE PRESENT ACTION .   THE COMMISSION HAS RIGHTLY OBSERVED THAT THE TREATMENT OF DURBECK IS NOT DISCRIMINATORY . IT EXPLAINED AT THE HEARING THAT THE CHILEAN APPLES SHIPPED AFTER APRIL HAD FIRST OF ALL BEEN HELD UP IN THE CUSTOMS WAREHOUSES OF A MEMBER STATE AND THEIR IMPORTATION WAS SUBSEQUENTLY AUTHORIZED ONLY ON OBJECTIVE GROUNDS NOT CONNECTED WITH THE IDENTITY OF THE UNDERTAKINGS CONCERNED AFTER IT HAD BEEN FOUND THAT PART OF THE APPLES ALREADY IMPORTED WOULD BE RE-EXPORTED OUTSIDE THE COMMUNITY . THE SMALL ADDITIONAL QUANTITY OF APPLES WHICH IT THUS BECAME POSSIBLE TO IMPORT COULD NOT REASONABLY HAVE BEEN SHARED AMONG A LARGE NUMBER OF FIRMS AND IT ACCORDINGLY APPEARED REASONABLE TO GIVE PREFERENCE TO GOODS WHICH HAD ALREADY REACHED A COMMUNITY PORT .   THE SOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION DOES NOT EXCEED THE LIMITS OF THE DISCRETION WHICH IT ENJOYS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THE TASKS ENTRUSTED TO IT BY REGULATION NO 1035/OF THE COUNCIL ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN FRUIT AND VEGETABLES .   IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES REGULATION NO 1152/CANNOT BE REGARDED AS DISCRIMINATORY AND THE SUBMISSION MUST ACCORDINGLY BE REJECTED .  BREACH OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE PROTECTION OF LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION   DURBECK SUBMITS THAT THE COMMISSION WAS IN BREACH OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE PROTECTION OF LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION BY NEGLECTING TO INFORM IT THAT A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF APPLES MIGHT STILL BE IMPORTED IN THE EVENT OF ITS SUBSEQUENTLY BEING FOUND THAT QUANTITIES OF APPLES ALREADY IMPORTED WERE NOT INTENDED FOR THE COMMUNITY MARKET .       THAT CLAIM DOES NOT CORRESPOND TO THAT PUT FORWARD IN THE APPLICATION , WHICH SOUGHT TO SHOW THAT THE LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION OF THE APPLICANT WAS DISREGARDED BY THE COMMISSION BY THE VERY ADOPTION OF THE PROTECTIVE MEASURES ; IT MUST THEREFORE BE REGARDED AS A FRESH SUBMISSION .   ARTICLE 42() OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COURT PROVIDES THAT : ' ' NO FRESH ISSUE MAY BE RAISED IN THE COURSE OF PROCEEDINGS UNLESS IT IS BASED ON MATTERS OF LAW OR OF FACT WHICH COME TO LIGHT IN THE COURSE OF THE WRITTEN PROCEDURE . ' '  IN THE PRESENT CASE THE APPLICANT HAS PUT FORWARD NO FRESH MATTER OF LAW OR FACT WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE AFOREMENTIONED PROVISION . THE SUBMISSION IS THEREFORE NOT ADMISSIBLE .  POSSIBLE LIABILITY OF THE COMMISSION AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF LAWFUL MEASURES   IT MUST BE OBSERVED THAT THIS ISSUE WAS RAISED ONLY DURING THE ORAL PROCEDURE AND IS THEREFORE ALSO A FRESH SUBMISSION BASED ON THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF MAY .    THE JUDGMENT GIVEN BY THE COURT IN CASE 112/CANNOT HOWEVER BE REGARDED AS A FACTOR ALLOWING A FRESH ISSUE TO BE RAISED PURSUANT TO THE AFORESAID ARTICLE 42().   FOR A NEW FACT TO BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY THE RAISING OF A FRESH ISSUE DURING THE PROCEEDINGS THE FACT MUST NOT HAVE EXISTED OR MUST NOT HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO THE APPLICANT WHEN THE ACTION WAS COMMENCED . SINCE MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS ARE PRESUMED TO BE VALID UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE COURT MAY DECLARE THEM INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE TREATIES ESTABLISHING THE COMMUNITIES , THE JUDGMENT GIVEN BY THE COURT IN CASE 112/MERELY CONFIRMED THE LAW WHICH WAS KNOWN TO THE APPLICANT WHEN IT BROUGHT ITS ACTION .   IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES DURBECK COULD HAVE SAFEGUARDED ITS POSITION ONLY BY PLEADING IN THE APPLICATION CLAIMS IN THE ALTERNATIVE WHICH IT CONSIDERED IT WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO ARGUE IF THE CONTESTED MEASURES WERE DECLARED LAWFUL .       THIS SUBMISSION MUST THEREFORE ALSO BE DECLARED INADMISSIBLE .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  ARTICLE 69() OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE PROVIDES THAT THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS IF THEY HAVE BEEN ASKED FOR IN THE SUCCESSFUL PARTY ' S PLEADINGS . IN THE PRESENT CASE THE APPLICANT HAS FAILED IN ITS SUBMISSIONS AND MUST BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .
