Summary of the Judgment
Freedom of movement for persons – Freedom of establishment – Freedom to provide services – Doctors – Recognition of diplomas
            and other evidence of formal qualifications – Directive 93/–  General practitioners – Requirement that Member States should
            make the exercise of the activities of general practitioner under their national social security scheme conditional on possession
            of a specific diploma – Limits – Acquired rights of doctors not in possession of a specific diploma but who have exercised
            their right of establishment before January – Extent – No requirement that Member States should consider acquired rights
            to be equivalent to obtaining a specific diploma – Granting of advantages to doctors in possession of a specific diploma and
            of acquired rights – Whether permissible 
(Council Directive 93/16, Art. 36(2))
The first paragraph of Article 36(1) of Directive 93/to facilitate the free movement of doctors and the mutual recognition
         of their diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications provides that, as from January 1995, and subject
         to the acquired rights it has recognised, each Member State is to make the exercise of general medical practice under its
         national social security scheme conditional on possession of a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualification
         awarded on completion of the specific training in general medicine practice that each Member State dispensing within its territory
         the complete training governing access to and pursuit of a medical profession is to institute in accordance with Article of that directive.
      
Article 36(2) provides that every Member State is to specify acquired rights, subject to only one condition, namely, that
         it should recognise the acquired rights of those doctors who do not hold such a diploma, certificate or other evidence of
         formal qualification but who, before January 1995, were recognised in that Member State as having a diploma, certificate
         or other evidence of formal qualification issued to them in another Member State and who, also before that date, obtained
         the right to exercise the activities of general medical practitioner under the national social security scheme.
      
That provision does not, however, require that the Member States should accord the same weight to acquired rights as to the
         obtaining of the certificate of specific training in general medical practice.  It does not, consequently, require the Member
         States to consider authorisation obtained before January to carry on the profession of general medical practitioner
         under the national health system to be equivalent to obtaining the certificate of specific training in general medical practice.
      
Thus, the mere fact that holders of the certificate of specific training in general medical practice, on the one hand, and
         persons in possession of the equivalent qualification only, on the other, did not, with regard to the allocation of doctors’
         posts, enjoy an equal chance of success is not contrary to the abovementioned provision.
      
In particular, it is not contrary to Article 36(2) for Member States to provide for doctors in possession of both that certificate
         and authorisation:
      
–      a pool of reserved posts more extensive than that provided either for doctors in possession of that certificate or for doctors
         who have been granted authorisation, by permitting them to compete in those two classes of reserved posts simultaneously;
      
–      yet more advantageous treatment by awarding them, when they compete for the quota of posts reserved to doctors authorised
         on December to practise the profession, the number of additional points attributed on account of their having obtained
         that certificate.

having heard the Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting on April 2004,
gives the following
Judgment
            
 The two references for a preliminary ruling concern the interpretation of Article 36(2) of Council Directive 93/16/EEC of
         April to facilitate the free movement of doctors and the mutual recognition of their diplomas, certificates and other
         evidence of formal qualifications (OJ L 165, p. 1), as most recently amended by Commission Directive 1999/46/EC of May (OJ L 139, p. 25, ‘Directive 93/16’), a provision which replaced Article 7(2) of Council Directive 86/457/EEC
         of September on specific training in general medical practice (OJ L 267, p. 26).
         
            
 Those two references were made in connection with two sets of disputes between, first, Ms Berardi and Others and Ms Vaira
         and Others and the Azienda Unità Sanitaria locale BA/and Others (Case C-11/02) and, second, Ms Fascicolo and Others and
         Mr De Benedictis and Others and the Regione Puglia (region of Apulia) and Others (Case C-10/02), concerning decisions made
         by various administrative authorities of that Region for the years and respectively with regard to the allocation
         under the national health system of posts for general practitioner posts in under-served areas.
         
The legal framework
The relevant provisions of Community law
            
 Directive 93/consolidates various directives on the qualifications of doctors, including Directive 86/457.
         
            
 According to Article of Directive 93/16, every Member State is to recognise the diplomas, certificates and other evidence
         of formal qualifications awarded to nationals of Member States by the other Member States in accordance with Article of
         that directive, by giving such qualifications, so far as the right to take up and pursue the activity of a doctor is concerned,
         the same effect in its territory as those that the Member State itself awards.
         
            
 Article 9(1) of Directive 93/lays down the general rule that, in the case of nationals of Member States whose diplomas,
         certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications do not satisfy all the minimum training requirements laid down in
         Article of that directive, each Member State is to recognise, as being sufficient proof, the diplomas, certificates and
         other evidence of formal qualifications in medicine awarded by those Member States when they attest to training which began
         before the dates mentioned in Article 9(1), accompanied by a certificate stating that those nationals have actually and lawfully
         been engaged in the activities in question for at least three consecutive years during the five years prior to the date of
         issue of the certificate.
         
            
 Article of Directive 93/provides that each Member State which dispenses within its territory the complete training governing
         access to the activities of a doctor and to their practice pursuant to Article of that directive is to institute specific
         training in general medical practice meeting requirements at least as stringent as those laid down in Articles and of
         that directive, in such a manner that the first diplomas, certificates or other evidence of formal qualifications awarded
         on completion of the course are issued no later than January 1990.
         
            
 The first paragraph of Article 36(1) Directive 93/16, which provision replaced Article 7(1) of Directive 86/457, recapitulating
         its terms, states that:
         ‘From January 1995, and subject to the acquired rights it has recognised, each Member State shall make the exercise of general
         medical practice under its national social security scheme conditional on possession of a diploma, certificate or other evidence
         of formal qualification as referred to in Article 30.’
         
            
 Article 36(2), which replaced Article 7(2) of Directive 86/457, while in substance repeating its content, provides:
         ‘Each Member State shall specify the acquired rights that it recognises.  However, it shall recognise the right to exercise
         the activities of general medical practitioner under its national social security scheme without the diploma, certificate
         or other evidence of formal qualification referred to in Article as having been acquired by all those doctors who on December possess such a right pursuant to Articles to and who are established on its territory on that date by virtue
         of Article or (1).’
         
The relevant provisions of national law
            
 Directive 86/was transposed into the Italian legal order by Legislative Decree No of August (GURI No of
         August 1991, ‘Legislative Decree No 256/91’).  The first paragraph of Article thereof lays down, as a general rule, that
         as from January it is possession of the certificate of specific training in general medicine that constitutes the qualification
         necessary for the purposes of practising the corresponding activity in the national health system.
         
            
 Nevertheless, according to Article of Legislative Decree no 256/91, the right to practise general medicine is also extended
         to doctors who, as at December 1994, had the right under the national health system to practise as general medical practitioners,
         that is to say, they held authorisation recognised to be equivalent to that certificate (‘equivalent qualification’).
         
            
 In Italy, practice of the profession of general medical practitioner officially recognised by the national health service
         is regulated, pursuant to Article 8(1) of Legislative Decree No of December (GURI No of December 1992),
         as amended by Legislative Decree no of December (GURI No of December 1993), by national collective agreements
         falling to be reviewed every three years.
         
            
 The national collective agreement in force at the time of the facts in the case in the main proceedings (‘the collective agreement’)
         was brought into force by Presidential Decree No of July (GURI No of September 1996, p. 1).  According
         to that agreement:
         
–
the procedure for filling empty posts is to begin with the publication, by region, of the regional single list of doctors
               classified according to a system of points computed pursuant to Article of that agreement (Article of the agreement);
            
–
for the purposes of drawing up the lists and classifying the doctors, points are to be allocated for the certificate of
               training in general medicine as an academic qualification.  In addition, by way of service qualifications, the persons concerned
               are awarded 0.points for every month of practice as a health service doctor in charge of primary care.  Extra points may
               be acquired by reason of certain special activities performed as a general practitioner (Article 3(1) of the collective agreement).
            
            
 So far as the allocation of posts in under-served areas in primary health care and medical cover is concerned, the collective
         agreement provides also that:
         
–
the Aziende Sanitarie Locali (local public health authorities) reserve a variable percentage of 20% to 40% of posts for doctors
               holding the certificate of training in general medicine referred to in Article of Legislative Decree No 256/and a corresponding
               variable percentage of to 60% for doctors holding the equivalent qualification (Article 3(6) of the collective agreement).
                If the agreement should not be renewed in good time, provision is made for a quota equal to 50% of the posts to be filled
               to be allocated to each of the two categories of doctors for the following year (final provision No of that agreement);
            
–
the list of posts to be filled, establishment by establishment, is drawn up by adding to the number of points obtained by
               the candidate on the regional list mentioned in Article of Legislative Decree No 256/the number of points awarded on
               account of living in the region and the number of points awarded on account of the candidate’s living in the under-served
               territory (Article 20(6) of the collective agreement).
            
            
 By resolution No of its regional council of April (BURP (Official Gazette of the Region of Apulia) No of May 1998) the Regione Puglia (the Region of Apulia) decided that in 40% of the posts intended to guarantee cover for
         under-served areas and of the unfilled posts should be allocated to doctors holding the certificate of training in general
         medicine and 60% of the posts should be allocated to doctors holding the equivalent qualification.  For the percentages
         of posts reserved for doctors in those two categories were altered so that the percentage of posts allocated for each was
         50%.
         
The disputes in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling
            
 The disputes in the main proceedings arise out of the fact that, with regard to the posts to be filled in the under-served
         areas, certain doctors who, while in possession of the certificate of specific training in general medicine mentioned in Article
         of Legislative Decree No 256/91, were entitled also on December to practise medicine under the national social security
         scheme tried to apply both for posts reserved for doctors possessing that certificate and for those reserved for doctors holding
         the equivalent qualification.  Those doctors sought moreover to obtain the twelve points awarded to holders of the certificate,
         even when they were competing for the quota of posts reserved to those who held the abovementioned qualification.
         
            
 The Regione Puglia at first decided that, although the doctors possessing both the certificate of specific training in general
         medicine and the right on December to practise medicine under the national social security scheme could take part
         in both quotas, they none the less were not entitled, if they chose to compete for the quota of posts reserved to doctors
         holding the equivalent qualification, to claim the twelve points awarded for possession of the certificate.  The Regione therefore
         ordered its local public health authorities to deduct the twelve points which had previously been awarded to those doctors.
         
            
 Acting in accordance with the instructions of the Regione Puglia, those authorities therefore refused to award, in connection
         with the quotas reserved to doctors holding the equivalent qualification, to doctors holding both the qualifications mentioned
         above, the twelve points attributed to holders of the training certificate.
         
            
 It was to challenge the decisions of certain of those authorities, including the Azienda Unità Sanitaria Locale BA/4, that
         Ms Berardi and Others and Ms Vaira and Others brought actions before the Tribunale amministrativo regionale per la Puglia
         (regional administrative court for Apulia), maintaining that those decisions were unlawful because adopted contrary to and
         as a result of misapplication of Articles 2, and of the collective agreement.
         
            
 Called upon to rule on the lawfulness of the position taken by the Regione Puglia, the national court originally concluded
         that doctors possessing both qualifications were entitled to compete for all reserved posts, but that they could not be awarded
         the twelve points awarded to holders of the training certificate when they competed for posts kept for holders of the equivalent
         qualification.
         
            
 Now, in the meantime the Consiglio di Stato (Council of State, Italy) held, in decision No of March (‘the decision
         of the Consiglio di Stato’), on an appeal against the judgment of another regional administrative court, that doctors to be
         chosen to fill posts in under-served areas must be drawn from a single regional list, even if it is laid down that, for the
         purposes of allocating those posts, two separate quotas must be reserved for doctors holding the certificate of specific training
         in general medicine and doctors holding the equivalent qualification, respectively, and that, as a result, doctors in the
         first of those categories who also had the right to practise, on December 1994, general medicine under the national health
         system, could compete for both quotas of posts, with the result that, according to the Consiglio di Stato, it was in that
         case necessary to award them all the twelve points provided for under Article 3(1) of the collective agreement, for the legislation
         in force did not draw any distinction in this respect between the two qualifications.
         
            
 Having taken cognisance of that decision, the Regione Puglia resolved to change its earlier policy and no longer to refuse
         to take into account the twelve points awarded to holders of the certificate of specific training in general medical practice
         in respect of the procedures for 1999.  The public health authorities of that Region therefore adopted that new way of allocating
         posts for doctors in under-served areas.  Nevertheless, the procedure for remained unaltered.
         
            
 It was to challenge that new position taken up by the Regione Puglia and the measures adopted in consequence by its local
         public health authorities that Ms Fascicolo and Others and Mr De Benedictis and Others, doctors in possession of the equivalent
         qualification only, also brought an action before the court making the reference.  They argue, essentially, that if doctors
         authorised before January and holding the certificate of specific training in general medical practice, and, what is
         more, obtaining the number of points awarded for acquisition of that certificate, were to compete for the two quotas of reserved
         posts, the result would be to render it quite impossible to apply the principle of equivalence introduced by Directives 86/and 93/16.
         
            
 In relation to the two sets of proceedings brought before it, the court making the reference agrees with the Consiglio di
         Stato’s view that doctors in possession of the certificate of training in general medical practice may apply for all the reserved
         posts to be filled in under-served areas.  Nevertheless, it cannot accept the Consiglio’s reasoning concerning the allocation
         of the twelve points to those doctors when they compete for the quota of posts reserved to doctors holding the equivalent
         qualification.  On that last point, the national court believes that the Consiglio di Stato’s decision seems to ignore the
         fact that, in Directives 86/and 93/16, the Community legislature considered worthy of protection the acquired right to
         practise general medicine possessed by doctors with no diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualifications, who
         enjoyed that right on December 1994, thus making it impossible to draw any hierarchical distinction between the two classes
         of doctors.
         
            
 In those circumstances, the Tribunale amministrativo regionale per la Puglia has decided to stay proceedings and to refer
         to the Court for a preliminary ruling the three following questions, which have the same wording in each of the two orders
         for reference:
         
‘(1)
Under Article 7(2) of Directive 86/457/EEC and Article 36(2) of Directive 96/13, for the purposes of practising as a general
               medical practitioner, is authorisation to practise obtained on or before December to be regarded as equivalent to
               the acquisition of the certificate of specific training in general medical practice?
            
(2)
In accordance with those provisions of Community law, does the acquisition of the certificate of specific training in general
               medical practice allow the Member States, as from January 1995, to grant to doctors in possession also of authorisation
               to practise acquired on or before December 1994, more favourable terms with regard to access to a wider range of reserved
               posts than the access granted to the holders of one or other of the qualifications respectively?
            
3)
If the answer given to the previous question should be “Yes”, then, in view of the rules on acquired rights, does the condition
               set out above permit the Member States to afford those doctors further special treatment by the award in every case of a number
               of additional points on account of their having obtained the certificate of training in general medical practice?’
            
            
 By order of the President of the Court of February 2002, Cases C-10/and C-11/were joined for the purposes of the
         written and oral procedures and of the judgment.
         
On the questions referred for a preliminary rulingOn the first question
            
 By its first question the national court asks whether authorisation, obtained before January 1995, to carry on the profession
         of general medical practitioner under the national health system has, pursuant to Article 36(2) of Directive 93/16, to be
         considered for the purposes of practising that profession to be equivalent to obtaining the certificate of specific training
         in general medical practice.
         
            
 It is not in dispute that possession of one or the other of the two qualifications mentioned in the previous paragraph is
         a minimum condition for the practice of the profession of general practitioner.  It is clear from the orders for reference
         that that question seeks in essence to ascertain whether the national system applicable in the circumstances of this case
         in order to fill posts for doctors in the national health system is compatible with Article 36(2) of Directive 93/16, having
         regard to the fact that under that national health system candidates in possession of the certificate of specific training
         in general medical practice and those in possession of the equivalent qualification only do not necessarily, so far as allocation
         of the posts in question is concerned, have the same chance of success.
         
            
 It is advisable at the outset to state that Articles to of Directive 93/are intended to harmonise the minimum conditions
         for the issuing of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications awarded on completion of specific training
         in general medical practice, with a view to facilitating the free movement of doctors (see recitals to in the preamble
         to that directive).  In accordance with that objective, the first paragraph of Article 36(1) requires, subject to acquired
         rights, that the exercise of general medical practice under a national social security scheme should be conditional on possession
         of such a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualifications awarded on completion of that specific training.
         
            
 It is in that context that Article 36(2) of Directive 93/states that ‘[e]ach Member State shall specify the acquired rights
         that it recognises. However, it shall recognise the right to exercise the activities of general medical practitioner under
         its national social security scheme … as having been acquired by all those doctors who on December possess such a
         right pursuant to Articles to and who are established on its territory on that date by virtue of Article or (1).’
         
            
 That provision confers on every Member State discretion to specify acquired rights, a discretion subject to only one condition,
         namely, that each Member State should recognise the acquired rights of those doctors who do not hold a general medical practitioner's
         diploma but who, before January 1995, were recognised in that Member State as having a diploma, certificate or other evidence
         of formal qualification issued to them in another Member State and who, also before that date, obtained the right to exercise
         the activities of general medical practitioner under the national social security scheme (Joined Cases C-69/to C-79/Garofalo and Others [1997] ECR I-5603, paragraphs and 30).
         
            
 In order to answer the first question, it ought first to be noted that, as is made clear by its wording, Article 36(2) of
         Directive 93/does not require that the Member States should accord the same weight to acquired rights as to the obtaining
         of the certificate of specific training in general medical practice. The minimum condition referred to in that provision,
         concerning the category of doctors who must be recognised as having acquired rights, does not attempt to specify the extent
         of the protection to be afforded those rights by the Member State concerned.
         
            
 Second, that requirement is intended to avoid situations in which doctors who have enjoyed the freedom of establishment guaranteed
         by the Community directives and, before January 1995, acquired a right to practise general medicine under the social security
         scheme of a Member State, are deprived of that right because they do not hold the new diplomas, certificates or other evidence
         of qualification provided for by Directive 93/(see Garofalo and Others, paragraph 31).
         
            
 It is therefore sufficient to observe that, even if that condition may, given such a cross-border aspect, require more extensive
         protection to be given to acquired rights, in the present case, as was confirmed at the hearing, the actions brought before
         the national court concern purely internal situations.
         
            
 In those circumstances it is to be remarked that the mere fact that, on account of the features of the applicable national
         scheme for the filling of posts for doctors in under-served areas, holders of the certificate of specific training in general
         medical practice, on the one hand, and persons in possession of the equivalent qualification only, on the other, did not,
         with regard to the allocation of those posts, enjoy an equal chance of success is not contrary to Article 36(2) of Directive
         93/16.
         
            
 In the light of the foregoing, the reply to be given to the first question has to be that Article 36(2) of Directive 93/does not require the Member States to consider authorisation obtained before January to carry on the profession of
         general medical practitioner under the national health system to be equivalent to obtaining the certificate of specific training
         in general medical practice for the purposes of access to general practitioner posts.
         
On the second and third questions
            
 By its second and third questions, which may appropriately be examined together, the national court asks, in substance, whether
         it is contrary to Article 36(2) of Directive 93/for Member States to provide for doctors in possession of both the certificate
         of specific training in general medical practice and authorisation on December to practise as general practitioners
         under the national health system:
         
–
a pool of reserved posts more extensive than that provided either for doctors in possession of that certificate or for doctors
               who have been granted authorisation, by permitting them to compete in those two categories of reserved posts simultaneously;
            
–
yet more advantageous treatment by awarding them, when they compete for the quota of posts reserved to doctors authorised
               on December to practise the profession, the number of additional points attributed on account of their having obtained
               that certificate.
            
            
 According to Ms Berardi and Others and to Ms Vaira and Others, the obligation referred to in Article 36(2) of Directive 93/16,
         viz., to recognise that doctors from other Member States, established in the host Member State and authorised before January
         to practise as general practitioners, are entitled to practise the profession of general practitioner, is not compromised
         by the system of reserved posts.
         
            
 Those applicants maintain, moreover, that it is legitimate for candidates ‘with dual qualifications’ to be offered a quota
         of posts of wider range.  All the effort dedicated to obtaining the certificate is justification for the certificate’s being
         accorded greater weight than that given to the equivalent period of medical practice.  In addition, if the twelve additional
         points were not awarded for acquiring the certificate, those in possession of it would be placed at a disadvantage in comparison
         to those who, instead of undertaking the required two years’ training, have practised medicine and thus accumulated additional
         points for experience.
         
            
 To the same effect, the Commission of the European Communities considers that, having regard to the Member States’ discretion
         in the specifying of acquired rights, neither the detailed rules for the participation in open competitions for access to
         a Member State’s social security scheme of doctors in possession only of authorisation to practise the profession granted
         before January 1995, nor any quotas reserved to them or the points awarded them in selection procedures, fall within the
         ambit of Directive 93/16.
         
            
 By contrast, Mr De Benedictis and Others argue that, as from January 1995, the Member States cannot grant doctors in possession
         of the certificate of training in general medicine who also obtained authorisation on or before December to practise
         the profession of general practitioner favourable terms with regard to access to a wider range of reserved posts than those
         allocated to the holders of one or other of the qualifications respectively.
         
            
 As has been stated in paragraph above, the discretion given to the Member States by Article 36(2) of Directive 93/to
         specify acquired rights is subject to one condition only, which affects solely those doctors who, having made use of their
         right to freedom of movement, have acquired the right to practise the profession of general practitioner under the host Member
         State’s social security scheme.  In keeping with the objective pursued by the Community legislature (see paragraph above),
         that condition cannot, therefore, concern situations that have no cross-border feature.
         
            
 In consequence, in purely internal situations such as those at issue in the main proceedings, the host Member State remains
         free to determine the extent of acquired rights.
         
            
 In this respect, it is true that – inasmuch as the national authorities’ reasons for drawing up, in these cases, two separate
         quotas for posts, one for holders of the certificate of training in general medical practice and the other for holders of
         the equivalent qualification, are based on the wish to protect that second category of doctors’ acquired rights – to allow
         a category of doctors to apply for the two quotas of posts simultaneously would lead to a reduction of the protection afforded
         to those who hold the equivalent qualification alone.  Such rules cannot, however, in themselves be contrary to Article 36(2)
         of Directive 96/13, a provision which, in purely internal situations, leaves the Member States free to specify acquired rights.
         
            
 In addition, it is necessary to make it clear that the fact of granting to doctors, when they compete for posts reserved for
         those who were, on December 1994, authorised to practise as general practitioners under the national social security scheme,
         the additional points awarded on account of having obtained the certificate of training in general medical practice is not
         contrary to Article 36(2) of Directive 93/either.
         
            
 In the light of the foregoing, the answer to be given to the second and third questions has to be that it is not contrary
         to Article 36(2) of Directive 93/for Member States to provide for doctors in possession of both the certificate of specific
         training in general medical practice and authorisation on December to practise as general practitioners under the
         national health system:
         
–
a pool of reserved posts more extensive than that provided either for doctors in possession of that certificate or for doctors
               who have been granted authorisation, by permitting them to compete in those two classes of reserved posts simultaneously;
            
–
yet more advantageous treatment by awarding them, when they compete for the quota of posts reserved to doctors authorised
               on December to practise the profession, the number of additional points attributed on account of their having obtained
               that certificate.
            
Costs
            
 Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the actions pending before the national court,
         the decision on costs is a matter for that court.  Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the
         costs of those parties, are not recoverable.
         
 On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) rules as follows:
         
 
1.
Article 36(2) of Council Directive 93/16/EEC of April to facilitate the free movement of doctors and the mutual recognition
                     of their diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications does not require the Member States to consider
                     authorisation obtained before January to carry on the profession of general medical practitioner under the national
                     health system to be equivalent to obtaining the certificate of specific training in general medical practice for the purpose
                     of access to general practitioner posts.
                  
 
2.
It is not contrary to Article 36(2) of Directive 93/for Member States to provide for doctors in possession of both the
                     certificate of specific training in general medical practice and authorisation on December to practise as general
                     practitioners under the national health system:
                  
 
–
a pool of reserved posts more extensive than that provided either for doctors in possession of that certificate or for doctors
                           who have been granted authorisation, by permitting them to compete in those two classes of reserved posts simultaneously;
                        
 
–
yet more advantageous treatment by awarding them, when they compete for the quota of posts reserved to doctors authorised
                           on December to practise the profession, the number of additional points attributed on account of their having obtained
                           that certificate.
