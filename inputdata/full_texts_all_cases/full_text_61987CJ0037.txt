Summary
THE PURPOSE OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS IS TO GOVERN THE POSITION OF AN EMPLOYEE WHEN HE FIRST BECOMES AN OFFICIAL OF THE COMMUNITIES . NO PROVISION OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS ENABLES ACCOUNT TO BE TAKEN, IN THE FORM OF ACCUMULATED SENIORITY AS PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE 44, OF A PERIOD DURING WHICH AN OFFICIAL PREVIOUSLY SERVED HIS INSTITUTION AS A MEMBER OF ITS TEMPORARY STAFF . EXPERIENCE ACQUIRED DURING THAT PERIOD CAN GIVE RISE ONLY TO THE ADDITIONAL SENIORITY PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .

BOSCO, PRESIDENT OF CHAMBER, R . JOLIET AND F . SCHOCKWEILER, JUDGES,  ADVOCATE GENERAL : G.F . MANCINI  REGISTRAR : H.A . ROEHL, PRINCIPAL ADMINISTRATOR  HAVING REGARD TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING AND FURTHER TO THE HEARING ON DECEMBER 1987,  AFTER HEARING THE OPINION OF THE ADVOCATE GENERAL DELIVERED AT THE SITTING ON MARCH 1988,  GIVES THE FOLLOWING  JUDGMENT  
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON FEBRUARY 1987, ECKHARD SPERBER, AN OFFICIAL OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE, BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION WHICH THE COURT, AS APPOINTING AUTHORITY, ADOPTED ON MARCH 1986, CLASSIFYING HIM IN GRADE L/A 6, STEP 3, AND, IN SO FAR AS NECESSARY, OF THE DECISION OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE COURT RESPONSIBLE FOR DEALING WITH COMPLAINTS OF NOVEMBER REJECTING THE COMPLAINT AGAINST THE CLASSIFICATION DECISION .  AFTER PASSING OPEN COMPETITION CJ 15/BASED ON QUALIFICATIONS AND TESTS, FOR THE CONSTITUTION OF A RESERVE FOR THE RECRUITMENT OF GERMAN LANGUAGE LAWYER-LINGUISTS, AND BEING INCLUDED ON A RESERVE LIST DRAWN UP ON JUNE 1983, MR SPERBER WAS, SINCE NO PERMANENT POST WAS IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE, ENGAGED BY THE COURT ON OCTOBER AS A MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF, IN GRADE L/A 6, STEP . AS FROM OCTOBER 1985, MR SPERBER WAS CLASSIFIED, AS A MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF, IN STEP .  BY A DECISION ADOPTED AT ITS ADMINISTRATIVE MEETINGS OF AND NOVEMBER AND MARCH 1986, THE COURT, AS APPOINTING AUTHORITY, APPOINTED MR SPERBER A PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL, WITH EFFECT FROM DECEMBER 1985, IN GRADE L/A 6, STEP .  THE COMMITTEE OF THE COURT RESPONSIBLE FOR DEALING WITH COMPLAINTS, BY DECISION OF NOVEMBER 1986, REJECTED THE COMPLAINT SUBMITTED BY MR SPERBER UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AGAINST THAT CLASSIFICATION DECISION WHEREUPON HE BROUGHT THE PRESENT ACTION FOR ANNULMENT .  REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING FOR A FULLER ACCOUNT OF THE FACTS, THE PROCEDURE AND THE SUBMISSIONS AND ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES, WHICH ARE MENTIONED OR DISCUSSED HEREINAFTER ONLY IN SO FAR AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE REASONING OF THE COURT .  THE APPLICANT' S ACTION FOR ANNULMENT IS BASED ON FIVE SUBMISSIONS, NAMELY INFRINGEMENT OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS, BREACH OF THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-DISCRIMINATION, INFRINGEMENT OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS, BREACH OF THE PRINCIPLES OF GOOD MANAGEMENT, SOUND ADMINISTRATION AND FAIRNESS, AND INFRINGEMENT OF VESTED RIGHTS .  IN HIS FIRST AND LAST SUBMISSIONS, THE APPLICANT ESSENTIALLY CHALLENGES THE COURT' S REFUSAL TO TAKE ACCOUNT, WHEN APPOINTING HIM AN OFFICIAL, OF THE SENIORITY ACQUIRED BY HIM AS A MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF . HE CONSIDERS THAT, AS A RESULT, THE COURT APPLIED ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS TWICE AND INFRINGED HIS VESTED RIGHTS .  IN DECIDING WHETHER THOSE SUBMISSIONS ARE WELL FOUNDED, IT IS APPROPRIATE TO BEAR IN MIND THE FACT THAT OFFICIALS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES AND MEMBERS OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF ARE GOVERNED BY DIFFERENT CONDITIONS OF SERVICE .  AS REGARDS, IN PARTICULAR, RECRUITMENT, THE ENGAGEMENT OF TEMPORARY STAFF IS GOVERNED BY ARTICLES TO OF THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OTHER SERVANTS, WHICH DO NOT REQUIRE THE PASSING OF A COMPETITION, WHEREAS THE RECRUITMENT OF OFFICIALS IS GOVERNED BY ARTICLES TO OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS WHICH, AS A GENERAL RULE, REQUIRE SUCCESSFUL PARTICIPATION IN A COMPETITION .  EVEN THOUGH ARTICLE OF THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OTHER SERVANTS REFERS, FOR THE PURPOSE OF CLASSIFICATION OF A MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF UPON ENGAGEMENT, TO ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS, ARTICLE CANNOT BE DEEMED INAPPLICABLE WHERE A MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF IS APPOINTED AN OFFICIAL, ON THE GROUND RELIED UPON BY THE APPLICANT, NAMELY THAT A MEMBER OF STAFF HAS ONLY ONE CAREER AND THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLE WOULD DUPLICATE THE PREVIOUS APPLICATION OF ARTICLE OF THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OTHER SERVANTS .  IT IS CLEAR FROM THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF JULY ( CASE 17/ANGELIDIS V COMMISSION (( )) ECR ) THAT THE PURPOSE OF ARTICLE IS TO GOVERN THE POSITION OF AN EMPLOYEE WHO HAS BECOME AN OFFICIAL OF THE COMMUNITIES FOR THE FIRST TIME .  BY VIRTUE OF THE JUDGMENT OF JUNE ( CASE 146/DE SANTIS V COURT OF AUDITORS (( )) ECR ), NO PROVISION OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS ALLOWS ACCOUNT TO BE TAKEN, IN THE FORM OF ACCUMULATED SENIORITY AS PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE 44, OF A PERIOD DURING WHICH AN OFFICIAL PREVIOUSLY SERVED HIS INSTITUTION AS A MEMBER OF ITS TEMPORARY STAFF .  THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE REFERRED TO BY THE APPLICANT, NAMELY THE FACT THAT WHEN HE WAS ENGAGED AS A MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF HE HAD PASSED THE COMPETITION FOR ADMISSION AND THEREFORE WAS ELIGIBLE FOR APPOINTMENT AS AN OFFICIAL, DOES NOT CHANGE THAT FINDING IN ANY WAY SINCE, IN THE ABSENCE OF A VACANT POST, HE COULD NOT BE APPOINTED AN OFFICIAL .  THE EXPERIENCE WHICH THE APPLICANT ACQUIRED AS A MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF OF THE COURT COULD THEREFORE ONLY BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION ON THE BASIS OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS WHICH, FOR THE PURPOSES OF CLASSIFICATION, LIMITS ADDITIONAL SENIORITY IN STEP GRANTED TO AN OFFICIAL TO MONTHS IN GRADES OTHER THAN A TO A 4, L/A AND L/A .  THE SUBMISSIONS BASED ON THE MISAPPLICATION OF ARTICLE AND INFRINGEMENT OF THE APPLICANT' S VESTED RIGHTS ARE THEREFORE UNFOUNDED .  IN HIS SECOND, THIRD AND FOURTH SUBMISSIONS, THE APPLICANT CLAIMS IN SUBSTANCE THAT HE WAS DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BY COMPARISON WITH THE OTHER SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATES IN THE COMPETITION WHO WERE OFFERED PERMANENT POSTS IMMEDIATELY AND BY COMPARISON WITH OTHER OFFICIALS WHOSE PERIODS SPENT AS MEMBERS OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT . THE COURT' S PRACTICE IN THAT RESPECT, MOREOVER, IS IN BREACH OF THE PRINCIPLES OF GOOD MANAGEMENT, SOUND ADMINISTRATION AND FAIRNESS .  AS REGARDS THE ALLEGED DISCRIMINATION BY COMPARISON WITH THE SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATES ENGAGED IMMEDIATELY, IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY CAN RECRUIT A PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL ONLY IF A POST IS VACANT . HAVING TAKEN PART IN A COMPETITION ORGANIZED WITH A VIEW TO CONSTITUTING A RESERVE LIST, THE APPLICANT WAS ELIGIBLE TO BE APPOINTED A PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL ONLY IF AND WHEN A PERMANENT POST BECAME VACANT DURING THE PERIOD OF VALIDITY OF THAT LIST AND ACCORDING TO HIS POSITION ON THAT LIST .  WITHOUT ITS BEING NECESSARY TO CONSIDER THE OTHER ARGUMENT PUT FORWARD BY THE APPLICANT, IT NEED MERELY BE NOTED THAT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS, AS INTERPRETED BY THE COURT IN ITS JUDGMENTS IN ANGELIDIS AND DE SANTIS ( CITED ABOVE ), THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY WAS UNDER AN OBLIGATION TO CLASSIFY THE PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE AND WAS NOT ENTITLED TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE SENIORITY ACQUIRED BY THE OFFICIAL IN THE MEANTIME AS A MEMBER OF THE TEMPORARY STAFF .  SINCE THE SECOND, THIRD AND FOURTH SUBMISSIONS ARE LIKEWISE UNFOUNDED, THE APPLICATION MUST BE DISMISSED .
