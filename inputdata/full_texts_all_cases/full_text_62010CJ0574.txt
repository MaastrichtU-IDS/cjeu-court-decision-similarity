                     of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts, without conducting
                     a Europe-wide invitation to tender, the Federal Republic of Germany has failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles 2,
                     and in conjunction with Articles to of that directive;
