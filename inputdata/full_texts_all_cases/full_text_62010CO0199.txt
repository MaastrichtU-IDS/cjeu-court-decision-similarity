Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Supremo Tribunal Administrativo –Compatibility with Articles EC, EC, EC, 58(3)
                  EC (now Articles 18, 49, and 65(3) TFEU) and with Article 5(1) of Council Directive 90/435/EEC of July on the common
                  system of taxation applicable in the case of parent companies and subsidiaries of different Member States (OJ L 225,
                  p. 6) of national fiscal legislation on the taxation of dividends distributed by a resident company to a non‑resident company
                  having a holding in the company paying the dividends of less than 25% – Taxation by deduction at source at the rate of 15%
                  provided for by the double taxation agreement concluded between the two Member States at issue ‑ Exemption of dividends paid
                  to resident companies.
               
Operative part: 
Articles EC and EC must be interpreted as precluding a tax scheme under a double-taxation agreement concluded between
         two Member States, which provides for a withholding tax of % on the dividends distributed by a company established in one
         Member State to a company established in another Member State, whereas the national legislation of the first Member State
         exempts from that tax dividends paid to a resident company. It would be otherwise only if the tax withheld at source might
         be set off against the tax payable in the second Member State in the full amount of the difference in treatment. It is for
         the court making the reference to determine whether such a neutralisation of the difference in treatment has been effected
         by the application of all the provisions of the convention for the avoidance of double taxation and prevention of the avoidance
         or evasion of taxes with respect to taxes on income, concluded on October between the Portuguese Republic and the
         Kingdom of Spain.
