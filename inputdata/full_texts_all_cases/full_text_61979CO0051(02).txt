Grounds
ACCORDING TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS THE COURT HAS JURISDICTION IN ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN THE COMMUNITIES AND AN OFFICIAL REGARDING THE LEGALITY OF AN ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING SUCH PERSON .  THIS ACTION DOES NOT CONCERN THE DECISIONS WHICH THE COMMISSION MIGHT HAVE ADOPTED CONSEQUENT UPON THE REPORT DRAWN UP BY PACTEL AND IN RESPECT OF WHICH IT IS IN ANY CASE ESTABLISHED THAT THEY HAD NOT YET BEEN ADOPTED AT THE TIME WHEN THE ACTION WAS BROUGHT . ON THE CONTRARY THE ACTION IS BASED ON THE CONTENT OF THE DISPUTED REPORT WHICH , ACCORDING TO THE APPLICANTS , CONTAINS UNFOUNDED ASSERTIONS AMOUNTING TO DEFAMATION IN RESPECT OF THEM .  A REPORT OF A STUDY DRAWN UP BY A PRIVATE COMPANY AT THE REQUEST OF THE COMMISSION CANNOT HOWEVER CONSTITUTE AN ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING AN OFFICIAL . THE APPLICANTS HAVE NOT INDICATED THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS ON THE PART OF THE     COMMISSION OF WHICH THEY WISH TO COMPLAIN . IN THE NOTE TO THE TWO DIRECTORS GENERAL HAVING AUTHORITY IN THE MATTER OF INFORMATICS , WHICH WAS SENT BY THE APPLICANTS TO THE COMMISSION BY WAY OF A COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , THEY ASKED FOR CONFIRMATION THAT THE REPORT WOULD NOT BE DISSEMINATED TO PERSONS OUTSIDE THE SERVICE OR USED IN ANY MANNER WHATSOEVER . THE APPLICATION IS NOT DIRECTED AGAINST ANY DECISION OF THE COMMISSION .  IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE COURT CLEARLY HAS NO JURISDICTION TO TAKE COGNIZANCE OF THE APPLICATION . CONSEQUENTLY THE COURT MUST APPLY ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE AND DECLARE , OF ITS OWN MOTION , AND WITHOUT OPENING THE ORAL PROCEDURE , THAT THE APPLICATION IS INADMISSIBLE .  
Decision on costs
