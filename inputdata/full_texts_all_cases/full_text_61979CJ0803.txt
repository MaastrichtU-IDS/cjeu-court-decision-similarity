ON THE INTERPRETATION OF REGULATIONS OF THE COMMISSION NOS , , , , , AND 3205/( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ; L , P . ; L , P . ; L , P . ; L , P . ; L , P . ; AND L ,  P . ) AND NOS , AND 735/( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ; L , P . ; AND L , P . ) FIXING THE EXPORT REFUNDS ON BEEF AND VEAL , IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER CUTS OF FROZEN , BONED OR BONELESS BEEF OR VEAL SPECIFIED AS INSIDES OF CHEEKS , THIN FLANKS AND SHINS , WHEN NOT PACKED SEPARATELY , QUALIFY FOR EXPORT REFUNDS , 
Grounds
BY AN ORDER OF NOVEMBER WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON THE 12TH OF THAT MONTH , THE EXAMINING MAGISTRATE AT THE TRIBUNAL DE GRANDE INSTANCE , PARIS , REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY A QUESTION ON THE INTERPRETATION OF SUBHEADING EX 02.A II ( A ) ( DD ) EX , APPEARING IN THE ANNEXES TO REGULATIONS OF THE COMMISSION FIXING THE EXPORT REFUNDS ON BEEF AND VEAL FOR THE PERIOD FROM AUGUST TO APRIL .      THE QUESTION AROSE IN THE COURSE OF A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION CONCERNING THE CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR OF A FRENCH COMPANY , CHARGED WITH HAVING MADE FALSE DECLARATIONS DURING THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PERIOD IN ORDER TO OBTAIN EXPORT REFUNDS FOR FROZEN , BONED OR BONELESS BEEF AND VEAL EXPORTED TO GREECE . THE CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES ASCERTAINED THAT THE EXPORTED MEAT INCLUDED THE INSIDES OF CHEEKS , SHIN AND THIN FLANKS , WHICH IN ITS OPINION DID NOT QUALIFY FOR REFUNDS UNDER THE ABOVE-MENTIONED REGULATIONS .   THE ACCUSED IN THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS CHALLENGES THAT INTERPRETATION . HE MAINTAINS THAT THE PRODUCTS IN QUESTION WOULD ONLY HAVE FAILED TO QUALIFY FOR THE REFUNDS IF THEY HAD BEEN PACKAGED SEPARATELY .   THE QUESTION ASKED BY THE COURT MAKING THE REFERENCE IS WHETHER THE WORDING OF SUBHEADING EX 02.A II ( A ) ( DD ) EX IN THE ANNEXES TO REGULATIONS OF THE COMMISSION NOS , , , , , AND 3205/( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ; L , P . ; L , P . ; L , P . ; L , P . ; L , P . ; AND L , P . ) AND NOS , AND 735/( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ; L , P . ; AND L , P . ) FIXING THE EXPORT REFUNDS ON BEEF AND VEAL MAY BE REGARDED AS COVERING EXPORTS IN CARDBOARD BOXES OF CUTS OF FOREQUARTERS OF FROZEN , BONED OR BONELESS BEEF OR VEAL , INCLUDING CERTAIN CUTS SPECIFIED AS INSIDES OF CHEEKS , THIN FLANKS AND SHIN , WHEN THE LATTER WERE NOT PACKAGED SEPARATELY , AND WHETHER THEY THEREFORE QUALIFY FOR EXPORT REFUNDS .   DURING THE PERIOD IN QUESTION IN THE PRESENT CASE THERE WERE TWO VERSIONS OF THE DISPUTED SUBHEADING , THE FIRST , WHICH APPEARED IN REGULATIONS NOS AND 2243/, BEING WORDED IN THE SIX LANGUAGES OF THE COMMUNITIES AS FOLLOWS :    ' ' . . .  MORCEAUX DESOSSES , A L ' EXCEPTION DES JOUES , DES ABATS , DU FLANCHET ET DU JARRET , EMBALLES SEPAREMENT : ' '      ' ' . . .  PEZZI DISOSSATI , ESCLUSI LE GUANCE , LE FRATTAGLIE , LA PANCIA , LA TIBIA E IL MUSCOLO ADERENTE , CONFEZIONATI SEPARATAMENTE . ' '   ' ' . . .  DELEN , ZONDER BEEN , MET UITZONDERING VAN KOPVLESS , SLACHTAFVALLEN , DE WANG ON DE SCHENKEL , AFZONDERLIJK VERPAKT . ' '   ' ' . . .  TEILSTUCKE OHNE KNOCHEN , MIT AUSNAHME VON KOPFFLEISCH , SCHLACHTABFALLEN FLEISCH- UND KNOCHENDUNNUNG UND DIE HESSE , GETRENNT VERPACKT . ' '   ' ' . . .  BONED OR BONELESS , EXCLUDING THE CHAPS , THE OFFALS , THE THIN FLANKS AND THE SHIN , PACKAGED SEPARATELY . ' '   ' ' . . .  UDBENET MED UNDTAGELSE AF KAEBER , SLAGTEAFFALD , SLAG OG SKANK , STYKKERNE EMBALLERET HVER FOR SIG ' ' .   IN A SECOND VERSION , REGULATIONS NOS , , , AND 3205/AND NOS , AND 734/INCORPORATED THE SAME MODIFICATION IN ALL THE LANGUAGE VERSIONS . IT READS ( IN FRENCH ) AS FOLLOWS :    ' ' . . .  MORCEAUX DESOSSES :   - A L ' EXCEPTION DES JOUES ET DES ABATS POUR LES EXPORTATIONS A DESTINATION DES ETATS-UNIS  - A L ' EXCEPTION DES JOUES , DES ABATS , DU FLANCHET ET DU JARRET , EMBALLES SEPAREMENT , . . . ' '   FROM A LINGUISTIC POINT OF VIEW THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE WORDS ' ' EMBALLES SEPAREMENT ' '  ( PACKAGED SEPARATELY ) REFER TO ' ' MORCEAUX DESOSSES ' '  ( BONED OR     BONELESS CUTS ) OR WHETHER THEY REFER ON THE CONTRARY TO THE EXCEPTION MADE FOR ' ' LES JOUES , LES ABATS , LE FLANCHET ET LE JARRET ' '  ( THE CHAPS ,  THE OFFALS , THE THIN FLANKS AND THE SHIN ). ALTHOUGH IN THE DIFFERENT VERSIONS THERE ARE GRAMMATICAL INDICATIONS , PARTICULARLY THE PUNCTUATION , WHICH SEEM TO SUPPORT THE FORMER INTERPRETATION , THE TEXT WHEN READ AS A WHOLE REMAINS AMBIGUOUS . THE FUNCTION OF THE WORDS IN QUESTION MUST THEREFORE BE EXAMINED IN THE LIGHT OF THE INTENTION AND PURPOSE OF THE REGULATIONS IN QUESTION .   IN THAT CONTEXT THE COMMISSION CLAIMS IN ITS OBSERVATIONS THAT THE COMMUNITY REGULATIONS RESTRICT THE GRANTING OF REFUNDS TO QUALITY CUTS OF MEAT . THESE DO NOT INCLUDE CHEEKS , OFFALS , THIN FLANKS AND SHIN , WHICH ARE USED FOR PROCESSING AND FOR WHICH AS SUCH THERE ARE IN ANY CASE MANY USES WITHIN THE COMMUNITY ITSELF . ON THAT GROUND THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR GRANTING EXPORT REFUNDS . MOREOVER , AS THE BONED OR BONELESS CUTS ARE SMALL AND PRACTICALLY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM EACH OTHER AFTER FREEZING , IT IS NECESSARY FOR EACH PIECE TO BE PACKAGED SEPARATELY IN ORDER TO ENABLE THEM TO BE INSPECTED .   THE COURT IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE COMMISSION HAS DEMONSTRATED SUFFICIENTLY THE REASON FOR THE REQUIREMENT CONCERNING SEPARATE PACKAGING : IT IS INTENDED TO FACILITATE INSPECTION AND MUST THEREFORE APPLY TO ALL CUTS WHICH QUALIFY FOR REFUNDS . THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS VIEW IS ALL THE MORE APPARENT IN SO FAR AS THE INTERPRETATION , WHEREBY THE WORDS ' ' EMBALLES SEPAREMENT ' '  REFER TO THE EXCEPTION , DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE SUCH AS TO GIVE THOSE WORDS ANY REAL PURPOSE . IT WOULD MEAN THAT CHEEKS , OFFALS , THIN FLANKS AND SHIN WOULD QUALIFY FOR REFUNDS WHEN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH CUTS IS CONCEALED , BUT THAT THEY WOULD FAIL SO TO QUALIFY WHEN THEIR PRESENCE IS EASY TO ESTABLISH , SOMETHING WHICH IS HARDLY IN THE INTERESTS OF THE COMMUNITY .   THE REPLY TO THE QUESTION WHICH HAS BEEN ASKED SHOULD THEREFORE BE THAT THE WORDING OF SUBHEADING EX 02.A II ( A ) ( DD ) EX IN THE ANNEXES TO REGULATIONS OF THE COMMISSION NOS , , , , , / AND 3205/AND NOS , AND 735/, FIXING THE EXPORT REFUNDS ON BEEF AND VEAL COULD NOT BE REGARDED AS COVERING EXPORTS OF CUTS OF FOREQUARTERS OF FROZEN , BONED OR BONELESS BEEF OR VEAL , SPECIFIED AS INSIDES OF CHEEKS , THIN FLANKS AND SHIN , OR AS ENABLING THEM TO QUALIFY FOR EXPORT REFUNDS .  
Decision on costs
THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , WHICH HAS SUBMITTED OBSERVATIONS TO THE COURT , ARE NOT RECOVERABLE ; AS THE PROCEEDINGS ARE , IN SO FAR AS THE ACCUSED IN THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS IS CONCERNED , A STEP IN THE PROCEEDINGS PENDING BEFORE THE NATIONAL COURT , THE DECISION ON COSTS IS A MATTER FOR THAT COURT .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ( SECOND CHAMBER )   IN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION REFERRED TO IT BY THE EXAMINING MAGISTRATE AT THE TRIBUNAL DE GRANDE INSTANCE , PARIS , BY AN ORDER OF NOVEMBER , HEREBY RULES :   THE WORDING OF SUBHEADING EX 02.A II ( A ) ( DD ) EX IN THE ANNEXES TO REGULATIONS OF THE COMMISSION NOS , , , , , AND 3205/AND NOS , AND 735/FIXING THE EXPORT REFUNDS ON BEEF AND VEAL COULD NOT BE REGARDED AS COVERING EXPORTS OF CUTS OF FOREQUARTERS OF FROZEN , BONED OR BONELESS BEEF OR VEAL , SPECIFIED AS INSIDES OF CHEEKS , THIN FLANKS AND SHIN , OR AS ENABLING THEM TO QUALIFY FOR EXPORT REFUNDS .
