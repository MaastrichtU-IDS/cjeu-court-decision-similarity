IN CASE 319/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE OBERLANDESGERICHT ( HIGHER REGIONAL COURT ) SAARBRUCKEN FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  SOCIETE DE VENTE DE CIMENTS ET BETONS DE L ' EST SA  AND  KERPEN & KERPEN GMBH & CO . KG  
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY , 
Grounds
BY ORDER OF DECEMBER , WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON DECEMBER , THE OBERLANDESGERICHT ( HIGHER REGIONAL COURT ) SAARBRUCKEN REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY THREE QUESTIONS ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY , IN ORDER TO ENABLE IT TO ASSESS THE COMPATIBILITY WITH THAT PROVISION OF A CONTRACT OF SALE AND THE CONSEQUENCES IF THAT CONTRACT SHOULD BE VOID .   THOSE QUESTIONS AROSE IN THE COURSE OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN THE SOCIETE DE VENTE DE CIMENTS ET BETONS DE L ' EST , SA , THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION , A COMPANY ESTABLISHED IN FRANCE WHICH SELLS CEMENT , AND KERPEN & KERPEN GMBH & CO . KG , THE DEFENDANT IN THE MAIN ACTION , WHICH IS ESTABLISHED IN     THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY , CONCERNING A CONTRACT CONCLUDED ON MARCH FOR THE ANNUAL DELIVERY OF APPROXIMATELY TONNES OF CEMENT FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS .   UNDER THE TERMS OF THAT CONTRACT , THE DEFENDANT IN THE MAIN ACTION , WHICH WAS DESCRIBED AS SOLE IMPORTER INTO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY , AGREED :   TO USE THE CEMENT SUPPLIED PRINCIPALLY TO COVER ITS OWN REQUIREMENTS ;  NOT TO SELL THE CEMENT OBTAINED FROM THE PLAINTIFF IN THE SAARLAND ; AND  IN THE EVENT OF DELIVERIES IN THE KARLSRUHE AREA , TO HAVE REGARD TO THE INTERESTS OF THE WORKS IN WOSSINGEN ( GERMANY ), PARTLY OWNED BY THE PLAINTIFF , AND TO CONSULT THE PLAINTIFF BEFORE SOLICITING BUSINESS THERE .   AFTER THE DEFENDANT HAD TAKEN DELIVERY OF AND PAID FOR PART OF THE QUANTITY AGREED FOR , IT RECEIVED , BUT FAILED TO PAY FOR , A FURTHER 051.TONNES OF CEMENT , TO THE VALUE OF DM 224., BETWEEN AUGUST AND OCTOBER . ON OCTOBER , THE PLAINTIFF TERMINATED THE CONTRACT OF MARCH AND CLAIMED THE ABOVE-MENTIONED SUM OF DM 244.. IN ADDITION TO PLEADING A SET OFF IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT , THE DEFENDANT CONTENDED THAT THE CONTRACT WAS VOID FOR INFRINGEMENT OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .   THE LANDGERICHT ( REGIONAL COURT ) SAARBRUCKEN GAVE JUDGMENT IN FAVOUR OF THE PLAINTIFF AND THE DEFENDANT LODGED AN APPEAL . CONSIDERING THAT THE OUTCOME DEPENDED UPON THE INTERPRETATION OF COMMUNITY LAW , THE OBERLANDESGERICHT SAARBRUCKEN REFERRED THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING :       ' ' . IS ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY TO BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT A FIVE-YEAR AGREEMENT FOR ANNUAL DELIVERIES OF APPROXIMATELY TONNES OF CEMENT MUST BE CONSIDERED VOID WHERE AN UNDERTAKING ESTABLISHED IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY AGREES WITH AN UNDERTAKING ESTABLISHED IN FRANCE AND ENGAGED IN THE SALE OF CEMENT NOT TO DELIVER THE CEMENT WHICH IT RECEIVES TO THE SAARLAND , AND IN THE CASE OF DELIVERIES IN THE KARLSRUHE AREA TO HAVE REGARD TO THE FRENCH UNDERTAKING ' S PART-OWNERSHIP OF WORKS IN WOSSINGEN ( GERMANY ) AND ON EACH OCCASION TO CONSULT THE FRENCH UNDERTAKING BEFORE SOLICITING BUSINESS THERE?    2.IF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED AGREEMENT IS TO BE REGARDED AS A BASIC CONTRACT AND IF IT IS VOID UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE EEC TREATY , ARE INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS OF SALE MADE IN PERFORMANCE OF THAT CONTRACT LIKEWISE TO BE REGARDED AS VOID?    3.IF QUESTION IS ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE : IS ARTICLE ( ) OF THE EEC TREATY TO BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT THE NULLITY WHICH IT STIPULATES IS SUCH AS TO AFFECT PHYSICAL TRANSACTIONS MADE IN PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CONTRACT OF SALE , SO THAT A SUPPLIER IS NOT TO BE PERMITTED , IN SO FAR AS HE HAS MADE DELIVERIES , TO CLAIM RECOVERY OF HIS ASSETS ( ON THE BASIS OF THE RULES GOVERNING UNJUST ENRICHMENT IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY ) UNDER THE VOID CONTRACT OF SALE?  ' '  FIRST QUESTION   IT IS CLEAR FROM PREVIOUS JUDGMENTS OF THE COURT THAT CLAUSES IN CONTRACTS OF SALE RESTRICTING THE BUYER ' S FREEDOM TO USE THE GOODS SUPPLIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN ECONOMIC INTERESTS ARE RESTRICTIONS ON COMPETITION WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY . A CONTRACT WHICH IMPOSES UPON THE BUYER AN OBLIGATION TO USE THE GOODS SUPPLIED FOR HIS OWN NEEDS , NOT TO RESELL THE GOODS IN A SPECIFIED AREA AND TO CONSULT THE SELLER BEFORE SOLICITING BUSINESS IN ANOTHER SPECIFIED AREA HAS AS ITS OBJECT THE PREVENTION OF COMPETITION WITHIN THE COMMON MARKET .   SUCH CONTRACT IS THEREFORE PROHIBITED BY ARTICLE ( ) IF IT IS CAPABLE OF AFFECTING TRADE BETWEEN MEMBER STATES .       THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION CLAIMS THAT , IN THIS CASE , THE CONTRACT DOES NOT FALL WITHIN THE PROHIBITION IMPOSED BY ARTICLE BY REASON OF THE WEAK POSITION OF THE PARTIES ON THE MARKET IN THE PRODUCTS IN QUESTION . IN THAT REGARD , IT WAS STATED IN THE COURSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS , WITHOUT CONTRADICTION , THAT FRENCH EXPORTS OF CEMENT TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY AT THE MATERIAL TIME AMOUNTED TO ABOUT TONNES PER YEAR . THE QUANTITY COVERED BY THE CONTRACT AT ISSUE THEREFORE REPRESENTED MORE THAN 10% OF FRENCH EXPORTS TO GERMANY . UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES , IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE THE VIEW THAT SUCH A CONTRACT COULD NOT APPRECIABLY AFFECT TRADE BETWEEN MEMBER STATES .   THE ANSWER TO THE FIRST QUESTION MUST THEREFORE BE THAT PROVISIONS IN A CONTRACT MADE BETWEEN A FRENCH EXPORTER AND AN IMPORTER ESTABLISHED IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY IMPOSING ON THE BUYER , DESCRIBED IN THE CONTRACT AS SOLE IMPORTER , AN OBLIGATION TO USE THE GOODS SUPPLIED FOR HIS OWN NEEDS , NOT TO RESELL THE GOODS IN A SPECIFIED AREA , AND TO CONSULT THE SELLER BEFORE SOLICITING BUSINESS IN ANOTHER SPECIFIED AREA , BOTH AREAS BEING IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY , HAVE AS THEIR OBJECT THE PREVENTION , RESTRICTION OR DISTORTION OF TRADE WITHIN THE COMMON MARKET . THEY ARE THEREFORE CONTRARY TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TREATY AND ARE VOID WHEN THE CONTRACT IS CAPABLE OF AFFECTING TRADE BETWEEN MEMBER STATES . WHERE SUCH A CONTRACT RELATES TO SOME 10% OF EXPORTS OF THE GOODS IN QUESTION TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY FROM FRANCE , IT IS CAPABLE OF AFFECTING TRADE BETWEEN MEMBER STATES APPRECIABLY .  SECOND AND THIRD QUESTIONS   IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUESTIONS THE NATIONAL COURT ASKS WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE NULLITY OF SUCH A CONTRACT UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TREATY , IN PARTICULAR IN RELATION TO ORDERS AND DELIVERIES MADE ON THE BASIS OF THE CONTRACT .   IN ITS JUDGMENT OF NOVEMBER IN CASE 22/( BEGUELIN IMPORT COMPANY AND OTHERS V SAGL IMPORT-EXPORT AND OTHERS ( ) ECR ), THE COURT RULED THAT AN AGREEMENT FALLING UNDER THE PROHIBITION IMPOSED BY     ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TREATY IS VOID AND THAT , SINCE THE NULLITY IS ABSOLUTE , THE AGREEMENT HAS NO EFFECT AS BETWEEN THE CONTRACTING PARTIES . IT ALSO FOLLOWS FROM PREVIOUS JUDGMENTS OF THE COURT , AND IN PARTICULAR FROM THE JUDGMENT OF JUNE IN CASE 56/( SOCIETE TECHNIQUE MINIERE V MASCHINENBAU ULM ( ) ECR ), THAT THE AUTOMATIC NULLITY DECREED BY ARTICLE ( ) APPLIES ONLY TO THOSE CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS WHICH ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH ARTICLE ( ). THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH NULLITY FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE AGREEMENT ARE NOT A MATTER FOR COMMUNITY LAW . THE SAME APPLIES TO ANY ORDERS AND DELIVERIES MADE ON THE BASIS OF SUCH AN AGREEMENT AND TO THE RESULTING FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS .   THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND AND THIRD QUESTIONS MUST THEREFORE BE THAT THE AUTOMATIC NULLITY DECREED BY ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TREATY APPLIES ONLY TO THOSE CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS WHICH ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH ARTICLE ( ). THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH NULLITY FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE AGREEMENT , AND FOR ANY ORDERS AND DELIVERIES MADE ON THE BASIS OF THE AGREEMENT , AND THE RESULTING FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS ARE NOT A MATTER FOR COMMUNITY LAW . THOSE CONSEQUENCES ARE TO BE DETERMINED BY THE NATIONAL COURT ACCORDING TO ITS OWN LAW .
