Subject of the case
APPLICATION , PRIMARILY , FOR AN ORDER SUSPENDING THE DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING DUTY IMPOSED BY ARTICLE OF COUNCIL REGULATION NO 1698/OF JUNE IMPOSING A DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING DUTY ON IMPORTS OF ELECTRIC TYPEWRITERS ORIGINATING IN JAPAN , INCLUDING THOSE OF THE APPLICANTS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), IN SO FAR AS THAT DUTY EXCEEDS THE LEVEL OF THE PROVISIONAL ANTI-DUMPING DUTY IMPOSED BY ARTICLE ( ) OF COMMISSION REGULATION NO 3643/OF DECEMBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), 
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION DATED AUGUST , TOKYO ELECTRIC COMPANY LTD , TEC BELGIUM , TEC ELECTRONIC GMBH , TEC EUROPE LIMITED AND TEC FRANCE REQUESTED THE COURT , PRIMARILY , TO SUSPEND THE DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING DUTY IMPOSED BY ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1698/, CITED ABOVE , ON IMPORTS OF ELECTRONIC TYPEWRITERS MANUFACTURED BY TOKYO ELECTRIC COMPANY LTD , IN SO FAR AS THAT DUTY EXCEEDS THE LEVEL OF THE PROVISIONAL ANTI-DUMPING DUTY IMPOSED BY ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 3643/OR , IN THE ALTERNATIVE , TO SUSPEND THE TIME-LIMIT OF THREE MONTHS FOR APPLICATIONS FOR REIMBURSEMENT UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF COUNCIL REGULATION NO 2176/OF JULY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) IN RESPECT OF THE PROVISIONAL AND DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES COLLECTED ON THE PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY THE APPLICANTS .  THAT APPLICATION , WHICH WAS LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON AUGUST , WAS MADE UNDER ARTICLES AND OF THE EEC TREATY AND ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE .  THE APPLICANTS REFER TO THE APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF ARTICLES AND OF THE AFORESAID REGULATION NO 1698/, WHICH APPLICATION THEY LODGED ON AUGUST .   BY AN ORDER DATED SEPTEMBER UTAX WAS GRANTED LEAVE , UNDER THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE STATUTE OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EEC , TO INTERVENE IN CASE 260/R IN SUPPORT OF THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE APPLICANTS . IT LODGED WRITTEN OBSERVATIONS ON SEPTEMBER .   BY TWO ORDERS DATED SEPTEMBER , THE COMMISSION AND CETMA WERE GRANTED LEAVE , UNDER THE FIRST AND THE SECOND PARAGRAPHS OF ARTICLE OF THE STATUTE OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EEC RESPECTIVELY , TO INTERVENE IN CASE 260/R IN SUPPORT OF THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE DEFENDANT . THE COMMISSION LODGED WRITTEN OBSERVATIONS ON SEPTEMBER .   BY TWO TELEX MESSAGES OF OCTOBER THE COURT PUT QUESTIONS TO CETMA AND THE COMMISSION . CETMA WAS REQUESTED TO SUBMIT ITS REPLIES IN WRITING BY 9.AM ON OCTOBER , AND THE COMMISSION WAS REQUESTED TO REPLY AT THE HEARING ON THE SAME DATE .  THE DEFENDANT LODGED WRITTEN OBSERVATIONS ON SEPTEMBER . THE PARTIES PRESENTED ORAL ARGUMENT ON OCTOBER .   IT IS NECESSARY TO SET OUT THE STAGES WHICH LED UP TO THE COUNCIL ' S ADOPTION OF REGULATION NO 1698/. ON FEBRUARY , A COMPLAINT WAS LODGED WITH THE COMMISSION BY CETMA ALLEGING THE DUMPING OF TYPEWRITERS ORIGINATING IN JAPAN , INCLUDING THOSE OF THE APPLICANTS . ON THE BASIS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS CONDUCTED AS A RESULT OF THAT COMPLAINT , THE COMMISSION ADOPTED , ON DECEMBER , REGULATION NO 3643/( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ). ARTICLE ( ) OF THAT REGULATION IMPOSED A PROVISIONAL ANTI-DUMPING DUTY OF 6.9% ON TYPEWRITERS EXPORTED BY THE APPLICANTS , A DUTY WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF AN APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT PENDING BEFORE THE COURT OF JUSTICE . ON JUNE THE COUNCIL ADOPTED REGULATION NO 1698/. ARTICLE ( ) OF THAT REGULATION IMPOSES A DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING DUTY OF 21% ON TYPEWRITERS EXPORTED BY THE APPLICANTS AND ARTICLE PROVIDES FOR THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION OF THE PROVISIONAL ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES WHICH HAD BEEN IMPOSED BY REGULATION NO 3643/.   THE APPLICANTS CLAIM THAT , IF THEY ARE NOT TO SUFFER SERIOUS AND IRREPARABLE DAMAGE , THE EFFECT OF THAT REGULATION MUST BE SUSPENDED AS REGARDS THEM UNTIL THE COURT HAS GIVEN JUDGMENT ON THE MAIN APPLICATION .  ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY , ACTIONS BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT OF JUSTICE SHALL NOT HAVE SUSPENSORY EFFECT . THE COURT OF JUSTICE MAY , HOWEVER , IF IT CONSIDERS THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES SO REQUIRE , ORDER THAT APPLICATION OF THE CONTESTED ACT BE SUSPENDED AND PRESCRIBE ANY OTHER INTERIM MEASURE PURSUANT TO ARTICLES AND OF THE TREATY .  AS A CONDITION ENABLING SUCH MEASURES TO BE GRANTED , ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE PROVIDES THAT AN APPLICATION FOR INTERIM MEASURES MUST STATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO URGENCY AND THE FACTUAL AND LEGAL GROUNDS ESTABLISHING A PRIMA FACIE CASE FOR THE INTERIM MEASURES APPLIED FOR .  IN THAT CONNECTION THE CHIEF GROUND WHICH , IN THE APPLICANTS '  SUBMISSION , ESTABLISHES A PRIMA FACIE CASE FOR THE MEASURES WHICH THEY SEEK IS THE FACT THAT THEY WERE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST , AS COMPARED WITH NAKAJIMA ALL , WHICH WAS THE ONLY JAPANESE PRODUCER OF ELECTRONIC TYPEWRITERS ON WHOM NO PROVISIONAL OR DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING DUTY WAS IMPOSED . IN SUPPORT OF THAT ARGUMENT , THEY STATE IN PARTICULAR THAT THE REASONABLE MARGIN OF PROFIT - AS REFERRED TO BY ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) ( II ) OF COUNCIL REGULATION NO 2176/OF JULY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), THE BASIC REGULATION ON DUMPING - WHICH THE COMMISSION APPLIED IN CALCULATING THE NORMAL VALUE OF THEIR PRODUCTS WAS NEVER THE SAME AS THAT APPLIED IN THE CASE OF NAKAJIMA ALL .  IN THAT REGARD IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE COMMISSION ADOPTED , ON OCTOBER , REGULATION NO 2812/( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), ARTICLE ( ) OF WHICH IMPOSES A PROVISIONAL ANTI-DUMPING DUTY OF 28% ON IMPORTS OF ELECTRONIC TYPEWRITERS MANUFACTURED BY NAKAJIMA ALL . RECITAL OF THAT REGULATION STATES THAT THE PROFIT MARGIN APPLIED TO NAKAJIMA ALL IS THAT REFERRED TO IN RECITAL OF COUNCIL REGULATION NO 1698/, CITED ABOVE .  WHILE THE DUTY IMPOSED BY REGULATION NO 2812/IS ONLY PROVISIONAL , THE ECONOMIC IMPACT WHICH IT WILL HAVE DURING THE PERIOD LAID DOWN IN THAT REGULATION WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THE ECONOMIC EFFECT OF THE DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING DUTY IMPOSED ON THE APPLICANTS '  PRODUCTS BY COUNCIL REGULATION NO 1698/, IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT IT IS POSSIBLE , OR EVEN LIKELY , THAT THE COUNCIL WILL IMPOSE DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES ON NAKAJIMA ALL ' S ELECTRONIC TYPEWRITERS AND ORDER THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION OF THE PROVISIONAL ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES .  WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE APPLICANTS MAY AT ONE TIME HAVE BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST , AS COMPARED WITH NAKAJIMA ALL , IT MUST BE STATED THAT THERE IS NO LONGER ANY DIFFERENCE IN TREATMENT AT THE DATE OF THE PRESENT ORDER . THERE IS THEREFORE NO PURPOSE IN CONSIDERING WHETHER THAT GROUND MIGHT HAVE ESTABLISHED A PRIMA FACIE CASE FOR THE INTERIM MEASURES REQUESTED BY THE APPLICANTS .  AS REGARDS THE APPLICANTS '  REQUEST FOR AN ORDER SUSPENDING THE TIME-LIMIT OF THREE MONTHS , PRESCRIBED FOR APPLICATIONS FOR REIMBURSEMENT UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF COUNCIL REGULATION NO 2176/IN RESPECT OF THE PROVISIONAL AND DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES COLLECTED ON ELECTRONIC TYPEWRITERS PRODUCED BY THE APPLICANTS , IT APPEARS THAT THAT PROBLEM WILL ONLY ARISE IF THE COURT , IN THE JUDGMENT ON THE MAIN APPLICATION , DECIDES THAT ARTICLES AND OF COUNCIL REGULATION NO 1698/SHOULD BE ANNULLED IN PART . IN ORDER TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM SHOULD IT ARISE , THE COMMISSION ' S REPRESENTATIVE STATED AT THE HEARING THAT THE COMMISSION WAS PREPARED TO ALLOW THE APPLICANTS TO LODGE PRO FORMA APPLICATIONS FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF THE ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES , WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED TIME-LIMIT , IN PLACE OF THE LONGER AND MORE COMPLICATED APPLICATIONS WHICH MUST NORMALLY BE COMPLETED . IF SUCH PRO FORMA APPLICATIONS ARE TO BE VALID , HOWEVER , THEY WOULD HAVE TO CONTAIN THE ESSENCE OF THE INFORMATION THAT IS NEEDED . THE COMMISSION STATED THAT IT WAS PREPARED TO DISCUSS WITH COUNSEL FOR THE APPLICANTS PRECISELY WHAT INFORMATION WOULD HAVE TO BE GIVEN IN SUCH PRO FORMA APPLICATIONS . THE PRESIDENT TAKES FORMAL NOTE OF THOSE STATEMENTS , WHICH WILL ENABLE THE POSSIBLE DANGER REFERRED TO BY THE APPLICANTS TO BE AVERTED . IT WOULD THEREFORE SERVE NO USEFUL PURPOSE FOR THE PRESIDENT TO EXAMINE THE QUESTION WHETHER THEIR APPLICATION FOR INTERIM MEASURES SATISFIES THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR THE GRANT THEREOF .  ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS , IT APPEARS THAT , AS REGARDS THEIR FIRST REQUEST , THE APPLICANTS HAVE NOT PUT FORWARD FACTUAL AND LEGAL GROUNDS ESTABLISHING A PRIMA FACIE CASE FOR THE INTERIM MEASURES WHICH THEY SEEK , AND THAT , AS REGARDS THEIR SECOND REQUEST , THEY HAVE FAILED TO ESTABLISH SUFFICIENTLY THAT THEY WOULD SUFFER IRREPARABLE DAMAGE .  
Operative part
