Subject of the case
APPLICATION  - FOR THE CONVENING OF AN INVALIDITY COMMITTEE PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ), PARAGRAPH 4, OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS,  - FOR THE REPAYMENT TO THE APPLICANT OF THE SUM OF FB BEING MEDICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL EXPENSES INCURRED BY HIM AND NOT REIMBURSED,  
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED ON JUNE THE APPLICANT REQUESTED THE ANNULMENT OF SEVERAL IMPLICIT AND EXPRESS DECISIONS OF THE COMMISSION RELATING TO THE APPOINTMENT OF AN INVALIDITY COMMITTEE WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND THE INSTITUTION OF THE PROCEDURE FOR THE CONVENING OF SUCH A COMMITTEE .  BY LETTERS DATED SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER 1971, AND BY TWO LETTERS DATED JANUARY 1972, SENT BY THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL FOR ADMINISTRATION AND PERSONNEL TO DOCTOR BELENGER AND DOCTOR D'AVANZO, THE COMMISSION INSTITUTED THE PROCEDURE FOR CONVENING AN INVALIDITY COMMITTEE .  IT WAS THE TASK OF THIS COMMITTEE TO ASSESS :  ( A ) WHETHER THE APPLICANT IS SUFFERING A TOTAL PERMANENT INVALIDITY;  ( B ) IF IT SHOULD TRANSPIRE THAT HE IS NOT SUFFERING A TOTAL PERMANENT INVALIDITY, WHETHER THE APPLICANT IS SUFFERING A PARTIAL PERMANENT INVALIDITY SUCH AS WOULD NEVERTHELESS RENDER HIM INCAPABLE OF PERFORMING THE DUTIES CORRESPONDING TO A POST IN HIS CAREER BRACKET;  ( C ) OR, FURTHER, WHETHER HE IS SUFFERING A PARTIAL PERMANENT INVALIDITY AS THE DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE ACCIDENT WHICH HE SUFFERED ON NOVEMBER 1962; THE PURPOSE OF THIS BEING TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO ASSESS THE COMPENSATION WHICH HE IS ENTITLED TO CLAIM UNDER ARTICLE ( ) ( C ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS ( IT MIGHT, IF APPROPRIATE, BE NECESSARY TO ASSESS THE EXTENT OF THE PARTIAL PERMANENT INVALIDITY RESULTING FROM THE ACCIDENT );  ( D ) THE DATE, IF ANY, WHEN THE MEDICAL POSITION RESULTING FROM THE INJURIES CAUSED BY THE ACCIDENT OF NOVEMBER 1962, HAD BEEN STABILIZED, AS WELL AS TO ASSESS WHETHER CONTINUING MEDICAL TREATMENT IS NECESSARY THEREAFTER;  ( E ) WHETHER MEDICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL EXPENSES, THE REIMBURSEMENT OF WHICH IS CLAIMED, SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE ACCIDENT AND COVERED BY ARTICLE ( ), AND, IF THIS IS NOT SO, TO MAKE A SEPARATE EVALUATION OF THESE EXPENSES ACCORDING TO THEIR ORIGIN .  BY THESE LETTERS THE COMMISSION SATISFIED ALL THE APPLICANT' S CLAIMS IN SO FAR AS LAY IN ITS POWER .  HOWEVER, THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COURT WERE SUSPENDED TO AWAIT THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE' S REPORT, BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVENE IT, SINCE THE DOCTORS APPOINTED BY THE COMMISSION AND BY THE APPLICANT RESPECTIVELY COULD NOT REACH AGREEMENT ON THE CHOICE OF A THIRD DOCTOR .  DURING THE COURSE OF THE HEARING AT WHICH PROCEEDINGS WERE REOPENED THE AGENT FOR THE COMMISSION STATED THAT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE ATTITUDE OF THE APPLICANT AND OF HIS DOCTOR THE PROCEDURE UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS WAS DEADLOCKED AND THAT, THIS BEING THE CASE, THE COMMISSION WAS BOUND TO KEEP THE APPLICANT IN EMPLOYMENT AND PAY HIM, IN SPITE OF REPEATED ABSENCES ATTESTED BY CERTIFICATES MADE OUT BY A VARIETY OF DOCTORS .  UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE DEFENDANT, WHILE MAINTAINING THAT THE INITIAL APPLICATION HAD BECOME DEVOID OF PURPOSE, SUBMITTED THAT THE COURT SHOULD TAKE SUCH MEASURES AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO CONVENE AN INVALIDITY COMMITTEE AS PROVIDED FOR BY ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS, ITS TASK BEING THAT SET OUT ABOVE .  AT THE SAME HEARING, THE APPLICANT, ADMITTING THAT IN FACT THE TWO DOCTORS COULD NOT REACH AGREEMENT AS TO THE CHOICE OF A THIRD, AGREED THAT THE COURT SHOULD TAKE SUCH MEASURES AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO BRING TO A CLOSE THE PROCEDURE FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF INVALIDITY .  THE STAFF REGULATIONS DO NOT PROVIDE A SOLUTION TO THE DIFFICULTIES INDICATED BY THE PARTIES .  ARTICLE - LAST INDENTATION - OF ANNEX II EXPLICITLY PROVIDES FOR THE INTERVENTION BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE IN THE EVENT OF FAILURE BY THE OFFICIAL CONCERNED TO APPOINT A DOCTOR, BUT REMAINS SILENT AS TO THE HYPOTHESIS OF A FAILURE BY THE TWO APPOINTED DOCTORS TO AGREE AS TO THE APPOINTMENT OF THE THIRD .  HAVING REGARD TO THE JOINT SUBMISSION OF THE TWO PARTIES AS REGARDS THE APPOINTMENT OF THE THIRD DOCTOR BY THE COURT, ARTICLE - LAST INDENTATION - OF ANNEX II SHOULD BE APPLIED BY ANALOGY AND MEASURES SHOULD BE TAKEN TO BRING THE PROCEDURE FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF INVALIDITY TO A CLOSE .  ACCORDINGLY, BEFORE ARRIVING AT A JUDGMENT IN THIS MATTER, THE NECESSARY MEASURES MUST BE ORDERED .  HAVING REGARD TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE IT IS ORDERED THAT IF THE DOCTORS APPOINTED BY BOTH PARTIES HAVE NOT AGREED ON THE APPOINTMENT OF A THIRD DOCTOR BEFORE DECEMBER THE COURT OF JUSTICE, FIRST CHAMBER, WILL UNDERTAKE THIS APPOINTMENT, THE TWO DOCTORS HAVING THE RIGHT TO MAKE WRITTEN OBSERVATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS TO THE COURT BY DECEMBER AT THE LATEST .  THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE SHALL PRESENT ITS REPORT WITHIN THREE MONTHS FOLLOWING THE DATE UPON WHICH IT IS CONSTITUTED BY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE THIRD DOCTOR .  IF MEANWHILE FRESH DIFFICULTIES THREATEN TO JEOPARDIZE THE NORMAL PROGRESS OF THE WORK OF THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE, THE PARTIES, THE COMMITTEE OR ITS MEMBERS SHALL BE AT LIBERTY TO NOTIFY THIS FACT TO THE COURT, WHICH RESERVES TO ITSELF THE POWER TO ORDER THE NECESSARY MEASURES .
