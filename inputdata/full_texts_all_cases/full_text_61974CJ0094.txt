Summary
. ( A ) THE PROHIBITION CONTAINED IN ARTICLE ( ) IS AIMED AT ANY TAX DEMANDED AT THE TIME OR BY REASON OF IMPORTATION AND WHICH, BEING IMPOSED SPECIFICALLY ON AN IMPORTED PRODUCT TO THE EXCLUSION OF A SIMILAR DOMESTIC PRODUCT, RESULTS IN THE SAME RESTRICTIVE CONSEQUENCES ON THE FREE MOVEMENT OF GOODS AS A CUSTOMS DUTY BY ALTERING THE COST PRICE OF THAT PRODUCT .  THIS PROHIBITION ATTACHES SOLELY TO THE EFFECT OF SUCH A FISCAL CHARGE AND NOT TO THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS IMPOSED; THE FACT THAT THE DUTY IS LEVIED BY AN INDEPENDENT INSTITUTION GOVERNED BY PUBLIC LAW RATHER THAN BY THE STATE ITSELF HAS NO EFFECT ON ITS DEFINITION .  ( B ) A DUTY FALLING WITHIN A GENERAL SYSTEM OF INTERNAL TAXATION APPLYING SYSTEMATICALLY TO DOMESTIC AND IMPORTED PRODUCTS ACCORDING TO THE SAME CRITERIA IS SUBJECT TO THE RULE OF NON-DISCRIMINATION IN MATTERS OF INTERNAL TAXATION LAID DOWN BY ARTICLE 95; IT MAY NEVERTHELESS CONSTITUTE A CHARGE HAVING AN EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO A CUSTOMS DUTY ON IMPORTS WHEN SUCH DUTY IS INTENDED EXCLUSIVELY TO SUPPORT ACTIVITIES WHICH SPECIFICALLY BENEFIT THE TAXED DOMESTIC PRODUCT .  . AS FROM JANUARY 1970, THE DATE OF EXPIRATION OF THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD, ARTICLE ( ) HAS, BY ITS VERY NATURE, PRODUCED DIRECT EFFECTS IN THE LEGAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE MEMBER STATES AND THOSE SUBJECT TO THEIR JURISDICTION .  . A DUE IMPOSED BY A MEMBER STATE HAS NOT THE CHARACTER OF A CHARGE HAVING AN EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO A CUSTOMS DUTY BY REASON SOLELY OF THE FACT THAT IT IS UTILIZED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FINANCING A SYSTEM OF AID WHICH IS RECOGNIZED AS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE TREATY .

IN CASE 94/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE PRETORE OF ABBIATEGRASSO ( ITALY ) FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  INDUSTRIA GOMMA ARTICOLI VARI, IGAV, A LIMITED COMPANY, HAVING ITS REGISTERED OFFICE IN ABBIATEGRASSO ( MILAN ),  AND  ENTE NAZIONALE PER LA CELLULOSA E PER LA CARTA, ENCC, ( NATIONAL BOARD FOR CELLULOSE AND PAPER ) HAVING ITS REGISTERED OFFICE IN ROME,  
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLES ( ), AND OF THE EEC TREATY IN RELATION TO A DOMESTIC CHARGE OF A FISCAL NATURE LEVIED ON CERTAIN PAPER AND CARDBOARD AND ON CELLULOSE, 
Grounds
1/BY ORDER OF NOVEMBER RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON DECEMBER THE PRETORE OF ABBIATEGRASSO, REFERRED SEVERAL QUESTIONS UNDER ARTICLE OF THE TREATY . THESE QUESTIONS WERE RAISED IN THE COURSE OF PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION AGAINST ENTE NAZIONALE PER LA CELLULOSA E PER LA CARTA, ( ENCC ), IN RELATION TO DUTIES CLAIMED BY THAT INSTITUTION AT THE MARKETING STAGE OF PAPER PRODUCTS COMING FROM OTHER MEMBER STATES OF THE COMMUNITY, UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF LAW NO OF JUNE ( GAZZETTA UFFICIALE NO OF JULY ) AND LAW NO OF MARCH ( GAZZETTA UFFICIALE NO OF APRIL ).  IN ORDER TO ENABLE IT TO JUDGE WHETHER THE FISCAL MECHANISM INSTITUTED BY THESE LEGISLATIVE MEASURES IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY, THE NATIONAL COURT HAS ASKED THIS COURT TO DEFINE THE CONCEPT OF 'CHARGES HAVING AN EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO CUSTOMS DUTIES' AS DEFINED IN THE JUDGMENT OF JUNE IN CASE 77/( CAPOLONGO V MAYA ( ) ECR ), TO STATE WHETHER ARTICLE ( ), DEALING WITH THE ABOLITION OF SUCH CHARGES, HAS DIRECT EFFECT, TO INDICATE THE DATE FROM WHICH SUCH EFFECT MAY BE INVOKED AND, FINALLY, TO DETERMINE IN CERTAIN RESPECTS THE SCOPE OF THE RULES ON COMPETITION LAID DOWN BY ARTICLE AND .  4/IT MUST BE REMEMBERED IN THIS CONTEXT THAT BY NOTICE PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF SEPTEMBER ( C 98, P . ) THE COMMISSION INITIATED A PROCEDURE UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TREATY IN RELATION TO THE ITALIAN SYSTEM OF AID, ADMINISTERED BY THE ENCC AND FINANCED BY A CHARGE OF A QUASI-FISCAL NATURE ON CERTAIN TYPES OF PAPER AND CARDBOARD AS WELL AS ON PULP . FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY WHICH IT HAD UNDERTAKEN, THE COMMISSION REQUIRED CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS IN RELATION TO THIS SYSTEM OF AID, WHICH WERE ACCEPTED BY THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC AS IS SHOWN BY A MEMORANDUM OF NOVEMBER FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THAT MEMBER STATE . IN THAT MEMORANDUM THE COMMISSION FOUND THAT 'THE MODIFICATIONS MADE BY THE ITALIAN AUTHORITIES TO THE SYSTEM IN QUESTION RENDER IT COMPATIBLE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY WITH REGARD TO AID '. IN RELATION TO THE FOREGOING IT MUST BE POINTED OUT THAT THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE PRETORE OF ABBIATEGRASSO RELATE TO THE PERIOD PRIOR TO THE MODIFICATION OF THE SYSTEM IN QUESTION .  THE CONCEPT OF CHARGES HAVING AN EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO CUSTOMS DUTIES  THE FIRST QUESTION ASKS FOR AN INTERPRETATION OF THE CONCEPT IN ARTICLE ( ) OF 'CHARGES HAVING AN EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO CUSTOMS DUTIES' IN RELATION TO DUES SUCH AS THE DUTY LEVIED BY THE ENCC AT THE MARKETING STAGE OF IMPORTED PAPER, CARDBOARD AND PULP, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT BOTH THE MANNER OF COLLECTING THESE DUES AND THE PURPOSE TO WHICH THE REVENUE DERIVED THEREFROM IS APPLIED .  IN ORDER TO INTERPRET THIS CONCEPT THE FOLLOWING THREE FACTORS MUST BE REMEMBERED IN CONNEXION WITH THE DUTY IN DISPUTE :  ( A ) THE DUTY IS LEVIED BY AN AUTONOMOUS INSTITUTION GOVERNED BY PUBLIC LAW, DEVOID OF ANY COMMERCIAL CHARACTER,  ( B ) IT IS APPLIED WITHOUT DISTINCTION TO DOMESTIC PRODUCTS AND TO PRODUCTS FROM OTHER MEMBER STATES,  ( C ) THE PROCEEDS ARE ALLOCATED TO CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH ACTIVITIES OF INTEREST TO THE CELLULOSE AND PAPER INDUSTRY, THE MAJOR PART HOWEVER BEING RESERVED FOR THE PAYMENT OF SUBSIDIES TO NEWSPRINT, WHICH IS ITSELF EXEMPT FROM THE DUTY .  AS WAS RULED IN THE JUDGMENT OF JUNE TO WHICH THE NATIONAL COURT REFERS, THE PROHIBITION CONTAINED IN ARTICLE ( ) IS AIMED AT ANY TAX DEMANDED AT THE TIME OF OR BY REASON OF IMPORTATION AND WHICH, BEING IMPOSED SPECIFICALLY ON AN IMPORTED PRODUCT TO THE EXCLUSION OF A SIMILAR DOMESTIC PRODUCT, RESULTS IN THE SAME RESTRICTIVE CONSEQUENCES ON THE FREE MOVEMENT OF GOODS AS A CUSTOMS DUTY BY ALTERING THE COST PRICE OF THAT PRODUCT .  THE FACT THAT A DUTY IS LEVIED BY AN INDEPENDENT INSTITUTION GOVERNED BY PUBLIC LAW RATHER THAN LEVIED BY THE STATE ITSELF AND IS USED BY THAT INSTITUTION FOR PURPOSES INTENDED BY THE RELEVANT LEGISLATION INVOLVES NO DIFFERENCE WITH REGARD TO THE POSSIBLE DEFINITION OF THAT FISCAL CHARGE AS A CHARGE HAVING AN EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO CUSTOMS DUTIES, SINCE THE PROHIBITION UNDER ARTICLE ( ) ATTACHES SOLELY TO THE EFFECT OF SUCH CHARGES AND NOT TO THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY ARE IMPOSED .  12/ON THE OTHER HAND, THE FACT THAT A CHARGE APPLIED WITHOUT DISTINCTION TO DOMESTIC PRODUCTS AS WELL AS TO PRODUCTS FROM OTHER MEMBER STATES GIVES RISE TO THE QUESTION WHETHER THE TAXATION AT ISSUE FALLS WITHIN THE PROHIBITION OF ARTICLE ( ) OR THE RULE AGAINST DISCRIMINATION IN MATTERS OF INTERNAL TAXATION LAID DOWN BY ARTICLE .  ONE AND THE SAME SCHEME OF TAXATION CANNOT, UNDER THE SYSTEM OF THE TREATY, BELONG SIMULTANEOUSLY TO BOTH THE CATEGORIES MENTIONED, HAVING REGARD TO THE FACT THAT THE CHARGES REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE ( ) MUST BE PURELY AND SIMPLY ABOLISHED WHILST, FOR THE PURPOSE OF APPLYING INTERNAL TAXATION, ARTICLE PROVIDES SOLELY FOR THE ELIMINATION OF ANY FORM OF DISCRIMINATION, DIRECT OR INDIRECT, IN THE TREATMENT OF THE DOMESTIC PRODUCTS OF THE MEMBER STATES AND OF PRODUCTS ORIGINATING IN OTHER MEMBER STATES .  FINANCIAL CHARGES WITHIN A GENERAL SYSTEM OF INTERNAL TAXATION APPLYING SYSTEMATICALLY TO DOMESTIC AND IMPORTED PRODUCTS ACCORDING TO THE SAME CRITERIA ARE NOT TO BE CONSIDERED AS CHARGES HAVING EQUIVALENT EFFECT .  15/THE SITUATION WOULD BE DIFFERENT, HOWEVER, IF SUCH A DUTY, WHICH IS LIMITED TO PARTICULAR PRODUCTS, HAD THE SOLE PURPOSE OF FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE SPECIFIC ADVANTAGE OF THE TAXED DOMESTIC PRODUCTS, SO AS TO MAKE GOOD, WHOLLY OR IN PART, THE FISCAL CHARGE IMPOSED UPON THEM . SUCH A FISCAL DEVICE WOULD IN FACT ONLY APPEAR TO BE A SYSTEM OF INTERNAL TAXATION AND ACCORDINGLY COULD BY REASON OF ITS PROTECTIVE CHARACTER BE TERMED A CHARGE HAVING AN EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO CUSTOMS DUTIES, SO AS TO BRING ARTICLE ( ) INTO OPERATION . SUCH A DEFINITION WOULD NEVERTHELESS IMPLY A CLEARLY ESTABLISHED CONNEXION BETWEEN, ON THE ONE HAND, THE COLLECTION OF A FISCAL DUTY LEVIED WITHOUT DISTINCTION ON THE PRODUCTS IN QUESTION, WHETHER DOMESTIC OR IMPORTED AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE ADVANTAGE WHICH ENURES ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE DOMESTIC PRODUCTS BY REASON OF THE PROCEEDS OF THAT SAME DUTY .  ACCORDINGLY THE ANSWER TO THE FIRST QUESTION MUST BE THAT A DUTY FALLING WITHIN A GENERAL SYSTEM OF INTERNAL TAXATION APPLYING SYSTEMATICALLY TO DOMESTIC AND IMPORTED PRODUCTS ACCORDING TO THE SAME CRITERIA CAN NEVERTHELESS CONSTITUTE A CHARGE HAVING AN EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO A CUSTOMS DUTY ON IMPORTS WHEN SUCH DUTY IS INTENDED EXCLUSIVELY TO SUPPORT ACTIVITIES WHICH SPECIFICALLY BENEFIT THE TAXED DOMESTIC PRODUCT .  19/THE SECOND QUESTION ASKS WHETHER ARTICLE ( ) IS DIRECTLY APPLICABLE AND IF IT CONFERS ON PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS A SUBJECTIVE RIGHT OF IMMUNITY TO CHARGES PROHIBITED BY THIS PROVISION . IT FURTHER ASKS WHETHER THIS SUBJECTIVE RIGHT DATES FROM DECEMBER ( THE DATE WHEN THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD CAME TO AN END ) OR FROM JULY 1968, THE DATE WHEN CUSTOMS DUTIES WITHIN THE COMMUNITY WERE ABOLISHED . THESE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE EVENT THAT THE DUTY IN QUESTION BE CONSIDERED AS A CHARGE HAVING AN EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO A CUSTOMS DUTY .  IT IS A MATTER FOR THE NATIONAL COURT TO DEFINE THE DUTY IN QUESTION, EITHER AS A CHARGE HAVING AN EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO A CUSTOMS DUTY OR, ON THE BASIS OF THE LEGAL CRITERIA OUTLINED ABOVE, AS INTERNAL TAXATION WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE . ACCORDINGLY, IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS BEING RELEVANT, AN ANSWER MUST BE GIVEN TO THE QUESTION PUT .  22/AS THE COURT HAS ALREADY INDICATED IN ITS JUDGMENT OF JUNE TO WHICH REFERENCE HAS BEEN MADE, ARTICLE ( ) LENDS ITSELF, BY ITS VERY NATURE, TO PRODUCING DIRECT EFFECTS IN THE LEGAL RELATIONS BETWEEN MEMBER STATES AND THEIR SUBJECTS . SUBJECT TO ANY SPECIFIC PROVISIONS, SUCH EFFECT OCCURRED AS FROM THE END OF THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD, NAMELY JANUARY . IN FACT THE COUNCIL'S DECISION OF JULY ON THE ABOLITION OF CUSTOMS DUTIES IN LINE WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF ON JULY ( OJ P . ) IS BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF A SELECTIVE ACCELERATION OF ACTIONS WHICH AS A WHOLE WERE TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD AT THE LATEST . IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT DECISION ONLY APPLIES TO MEASURES TO WHICH IT SPECIFICALLY REFERS, THAT IS TO SAY, TO CUSTOMS DUTIES AS SUCH AND TO QUANTITATIVE RESTRICTIONS .  IN PRINCIPLE THE REPLY MUST THEREFORE BE THAT THE DIRECT EFFECT OF ARTICLE ( ) CAN ONLY BE INVOKED AS FROM JANUARY .  27/THE APPLICANT IN THE MAIN ACTION PUT FORWARD IN ADDITION A WIDE RANGE OF CRITICISMS IN RELATION TO THE SYSTEM OF IMPORTATION OF PAPER, CARDBOARD AND PULP INTO ITALY . IT CONSIDERS THAT THE FISCAL SYSTEM APPLIED UNDER THE ITALIAN LEGISLATION IS DISCRIMINATORY WITH REGARD TO PRODUCTS IMPORTED FROM OTHER MEMBER STATES AND THAT THE INTERPOSITION OF THE ENCC HAS SO RESTRICTIVE AN EFFECT ON TRADE AS PRACTICALLY TO ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITIES OF INTRA-COMMUNITY TRADE ON THE ITALIAN MARKET . IN PARTICULAR IT POINTS OUT THAT THE CHANGES MADE IN THE ITALIAN LEGISLATION FOLLOWING THE STEPS TAKEN BY THE COMMISSION ARE A RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT, AT ANY RATE UP TO THE TIME OF THE ELIMINATION OF THE INCOMPATIBILITIES FOUND TO HAVE EXISTED, THIS SYSTEM WAS CONTRARY TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY RELATING TO PUBLIC AID . FROM THIS IT DRAWS THE CONCLUSION THAT A DUTY INTENDED TO FINANCE THE FUNCTIONING OF SUCH A SYSTEM MUST BE CONSIDERED A CHARGE PROHIBITED BY THE TREATY .  29/THE FACT THAT A DUE IMPOSED BY A MEMBER STATE IS UTILIZED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FINANCING A SYSTEM OF AID WHICH IS RECOGNIZED AS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE TREATY DOES NOT ATTACT TO SUCH DUE THE CHARACTER OF A CHARGE HAVING AN EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO A CUSTOMS DUTY . MOREOVER, WHATEVER DOUBTS MAY BE FELT AS REGARDS THE COMPATIBILITY WITH THE TREATY OF THE SYSTEM IN QUESTION AND AS REGARDS THE ENCC'S INTERVENTION IN THE FIELD OF INTRA-COMMUNITY TRADE, ESPECIALLY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE PROHIBITION OF MEASURES HAVING AN EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO QUANTITATIVE RESTRICTIONS, THE FACT REMAINS THAT THE NATIONAL COURT DID NOT ASK THIS COURT TO RULE ON THESE ASPECTS . DESPITE THE REFERENCE MADE BY THE NATIONAL COURT IN ITS ORDER REFERRING THE MATTER TO THE PRINCIPLE OF THE FREE MOVEMENT OF GOODS, TO THE OBJECTIVE OF MERGER OF THE DIFFERENT NATIONAL MARKETS INTO A SINGLE MARKET AND TO THE ELIMINATION OF ANY FORM OF DISCRIMINATION BY THE TREATY, THERE ARE NO QUESTIONS BEFORE THE COURT OF SUFFICIENTLY PRECISE A NATURE TO ENABLE IT TO CONSIDER THE OBJECTIONS RAISED BY THE APPLICANT IN THE MAIN ACTION . ACCORDINGLY THESE ARGUMENTS MUST BE DISREGARDED IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE PRESENT PROCEEDINGS .  THE SYSTEM OF COMPETITION  THE THIRD QUESTION ASKS IN SUBSTANCE WHETHER OR NOT THE REDISTRIBUTION OF CHARGES AND BENEFITS BETWEEN IMPORTERS OF PAPER CARDBOARD AND PULP, ON THE ONE HAND, AND OF NATIONAL PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS OF THESE GOODS, ON THE OTHER, AS WELL AS THE ENCC'S INTERVENTION WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS REDISTRIBUTION, INFRINGE THE RULES ON COMPETITION LAID DOWN IN ARTICLES AND OF THE TREATY .  33/APART FROM THE RULES ON COMPETITION APPLICABLE TO UNDERTAKINGS, INCLUDING ARTICLES AND 86, TO WHICH THE REFERENCE WAS MADE BY THE NATIONAL COURT, THE TREATY INCLUDES VARIOUS PROVISIONS RELATING TO INFRINGEMENTS OF THE NORMAL FUNCTIONING OF THE COMPETITION SYSTEM BY ACTIONS ON THE PART OF THE STATES . THIS IN PARTICULAR IS THE PURPOSE OF ARTICLE TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT LAYS DOWN A PARTICULAR SYSTEM IN FAVOUR OF UNDERTAKINGS ENTRUSTED WITH THE OPERATION OF SERVICES OF GENERAL ECONOMIC INTEREST OR HAVING THE CHARACTER OF A REVENUE-PRODUCING MONOPOLY, OF ARTICLES TO 94, ON THE SYSTEM OF PUBLIC AID, OF ARTICLES AND ON DISTORTIONS RESULTING FROM PROVISIONS OF PUBLIC LAW CAPABLE OF DISTORTING COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS ON THE COMMON MARKET, AS WELL AS ARTICLE ON STATE MONOPOLIES OF A COMMERCIAL CHARACTER .  THE ACTIVITIES OF AN INSTITUTION OF A PUBLIC NATURE, EVEN IF AUTONOMOUS, FALL UNDER THE PROVISIONS REFERRED TO AND NOT UNDER ARTICLES AND 86, EVEN IF ITS INTERVENTIONS TAKE PLACE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND ARE DEVOID OF A COMMERCIAL CHARACTER .  IT IS A MATTER FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE NATIONAL COURTS TO TAKE THE APPROPRIATE MEASURES IN SO FAR AS THE INTERVENTIONS OF THE STATE OR OF ITS DECENTRALIZED AGENCIES MIGHT INFRINGE SUCH RULES AS MIGHT BE DIRECTLY INVOKED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS . IT IS, MOREOVER, FOR THE COMMISSION TO SEE TO IT THAT THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY ARE RESPECTED BY THE AUTHORITIES OF THE MEMBER STATES .  ACCORDINGLY, THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION MUST BE THAT ACCORDING TO THE SYSTEM OF THE TREATY THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES AND ARE NOT APPLICABLE TO ACTIVITIES OF THE KIND COVERED BY THE QUESTION .  
Decision on costs
THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC AND THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, WHICH HAVE SUBMITTED OBSERVATIONS TO THE COURT, ARE NOT RECOVERABLE AND AS THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE, IN SO FAR AS THE PARTIES TO THE MAIN ACTION ARE CONCERNED, A STEP IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THE PRETORE OF ABBIATEGRASSO, THE DECISION ON COSTS IS A MATTER FOR THAT COURT .  ON THOSE GROUNDS  
Operative part
THE COURT  IN ANSWER TO THE QUESTIONS REFERRED TO IT BY THE PRETORE OF ABBIATEGRASSO BY ORDER OF THAT COURT OF NOVEMBER 1974, HEREBY RULES :  . A DUTY FALLING WITHIN A GENERAL SYSTEM OF INTERNAL TAXATION APPLYING SYSTEMATICALLY TO DOMESTIC AND IMPORTED PRODUCTS ACCORDING TO THE SAME CRITERIA CAN NEVERTHELESS CONSTITUTE A CHARGE HAVING AN EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO A CUSTOMS DUTY ON IMPORTS, WHEN SUCH DUTY IS INTENDED EXCLUSIVELY TO SUPPORT ACTIVITIES WHICH SPECIFICALLY BENEFIT THE TAXED DOMESTIC PRODUCT;  . AS FROM JANUARY ARTICLE ( ) PRODUCES, BY ITS VERY NATURE, DIRECT EFFECTS IN THE LEGAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE MEMBER STATES AND THEIR SUBJECTS;  . THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES AND DO NOT APPLY TO ACTIVITIES OF THE KIND REFERRED TO BY THE NATIONAL COURT .
