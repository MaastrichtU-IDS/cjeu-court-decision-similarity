Operative part
The Court: 
1.
	Declares that, by using an incomplete definition of normal residence for the purpose of determining whether there is an entitlement
                     to a tax exemption in respect of the temporary import of vehicles, the Republic of Finland has failed to fulfil its obligations
                     under Article 7(1) of Council Directive 83/182/EEC of March on tax exemptions within the Community for certain means
                     of transport temporarily imported into one Member State from another;
                  
2.
	Orders the Republic of Finland to pay the costs.
