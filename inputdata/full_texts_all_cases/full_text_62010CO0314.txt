1.                     Questions referred for a preliminary ruling – Reference to the Court – Jurisdiction of the national courts – National legislation
            giving priority to a preliminary procedure reviewing constitutionality – Not permissible – Condition (Art. TFEU) (see
            para. 21)
2.                     Preliminary rulings – Jurisdiction of the Court – Limits – Request for interpretation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights
            of the European Union – National decision not indicating any connection with the law of the Union – Lack of jurisdiction of
            the Court (Art. TFEU; Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, Arts 17, and 51(1)) (see paras 22-25)
Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Tribunal de première instance de Liège – Interpretation of Articles TEU, TFEU and
                  of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union – Obligatory preliminary referral to the constitutional court
                  by national courts in cases of presumed infringement of fundamental rights by national legislation – Compatibility with Union
                  law of the provision of national law requiring that preliminary referral – Possibility for national courts of reviewing the
                  compatibility of national rules with international treaties when the constitutional court has declared the national legislation
                  at issue compatible with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
               
Operative part 
The Court of Justice of the European Union manifestly lacks jurisdiction to answer the question referred for a  preliminary
         ruling by the Tribunal de première instance de Liège (Belgium).
