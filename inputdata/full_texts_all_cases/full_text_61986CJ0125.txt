Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON MAY 1986, THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION BEFORE THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE MEASURES NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 83/181/EEC OF MARCH DETERMINING THE SCOPE OF ARTICLE 14*(1)*(D ) OF DIRECTIVE 77/388/EEC AS REGARDS EXEMPTION FROM VALUE-ADDED TAX ON THE FINAL IMPORTATION OF CERTAIN GOODS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL 1983, L*105, P.*), THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAD FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY .  ARTICLE 93*() OF DIRECTIVE 83/181/EEC PROVIDES THAT MEMBER STATES ARE TO BRING INTO FORCE THE REQUISITE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS BY JULY AT THE LATEST AND THAT THEY ARE TO INFORM THE COMMISSION OF THE MEASURES ADOPTED TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE DIRECTIVE .  NOT HAVING RECEIVED FROM THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT ANY COMMUNICATION CONCERNING MEASURES TO IMPLEMENT THE DIRECTIVE, THE COMMISSION SENT IT ON DECEMBER A FORMAL NOTICE CALLING UPON IT TO SUBMIT ITS OBSERVATIONS . AFTER DELIVERING A REASONED OPINION ON JULY AND AFTER GRANTING THREE REQUESTS MADE BY THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT FOR EXTENSIONS OF THE PERIOD IT WAS ALLOWED FOR COMPLYING WITH THE REASONED OPINION, SO AS TO ENABLE IT TO ADOPT A DRAFT LAW RELATING TO THE DIRECTIVE, THE COMMISSION BROUGHT THE PRESENT ACTION .  REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING FOR A FULLER ACCOUNT OF THE FACTS, THE PROCEDURE AND THE SUBMISSIONS AND ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES, WHICH ARE MENTIONED OR DISCUSSED HEREINAFTER ONLY IN SO FAR AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE REASONING OF THE COURT .  THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS NOT YET FULFILLED ITS OBLIGATIONS . AT THE HEARING IT STATED THAT THE DRAFT LAW DESIGNED TO IMPLEMENT THE DIRECTIVE WAS BEFORE PARLIAMENT AND HAD ALREADY RECEIVED THE ASSENT OF THE BUDGETARY COMMITTEE . THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WOULD CONTINUE BUT POLITICAL DIFFICULTIES HAD PREVENTED IT FROM BEING COMPLETED BEFORE THE COURT HEARING .  IT SHOULD BE RECALLED THAT IT IS ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW THAT A MEMBER STATE MAY NOT PLEAD PROVISIONS, PRACTICES OR CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING IN ITS INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OBLIGATIONS AND TIME-LIMITS LAID DOWN BY DIRECTIVES .  IT MUST THEREFORE BE CONCLUDED THAT BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE MEASURES NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 83/181/EEC OF MARCH DETERMINING THE SCOPE OF ARTICLE 14*(1)*(D ) OF DIRECTIVE 77/388/EEC AS REGARDS EXEMPTION FROM VALUE-ADDED TAX ON THE FINAL IMPORTATION OF CERTAIN GOODS, THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  UNDER ARTICLE 69*() OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY MUST BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS . AS THE DEFENDANT HAS FAILED IN ITS SUBMISSIONS, IT MUST BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .
