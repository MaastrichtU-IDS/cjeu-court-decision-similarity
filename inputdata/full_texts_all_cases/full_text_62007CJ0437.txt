Operative part
The Court: 
1.
	Declares that, in so far as the Comune di l’Aquila (Commune of Aquila) awarded a public works contract concerning the design
                     and construction of a rubber-tyred tramway for public transport in that town by means of a procedure different from those
                     laid down for the award of public works contracts by Council Directive 93/37/EEC of June concerning the coordination
                     of procedures for the award of public works contracts, the Italian Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under that
                     directive;
                  
2.
	Orders the Italian Republic to pay the costs.
