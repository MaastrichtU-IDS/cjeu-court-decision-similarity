Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Tribunal de première instance, Liège – Interpretation of Articles TEU, TFEU and
                  of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union – National courts bound to make a referral beforehand to the
                  Constitutional Court in cases of presumed infringement by national legislation of fundamental rights – Whether the national
                  provision requiring that preliminary referral accords with Union law – Possibility for national courts of reviewing the compatibility
                  of the national rules with international treaties when the Constitutional Court has declared the national legislation at issue
                  compatible with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution.
               
Re: 
The Court of Justice of the European Union manifestly lacks jurisdiction to answer the question referred for a preliminary
         ruling by the tribunal de première instance de Liège (Belgium).
