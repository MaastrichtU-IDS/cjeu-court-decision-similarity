Summary
Under Articles 3b and of the Treaty, the Court, like the other institutions of the Community, has jurisdiction to act only within the limits of the powers conferred upon it by the Treaty.  Neither the jurisdiction to take cognisance of actions brought by natural or legal persons against other natural or legal persons, nor the jurisdiction to take cognisance of actions for annulment of purely national decisions falls within those powers.  Accordingly, such actions are manifestly inadmissible.
