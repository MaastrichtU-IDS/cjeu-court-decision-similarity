IN CASE 109/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE COLLEGE VAN BEROEP VOOR HET BEDRIJFSLEVEN ( ADMINISTRATIVE COURT OF LAST INSTANCE IN MATTERS OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY ) ( NETHERLANDS ) FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  C . TONEMAN BV , LEIDSCHENDAM ,   AND      MINISTER FOR ECONOMIC AFFAIRS , THE HAGUE ,   
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF REGULATION NO 1023/OF THE COUNCIL OF MAY ESTABLISHING A COMMON PROCEDURE FOR ADMINISTERING QUANTITATIVE QUOTAS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ), 
Grounds
BY ORDER DATED MARCH , WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON APRIL , THE COLLEGE VAN BEROEP VOOR HET BEDRIJFSLEVEN REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY TWO QUESTIONS ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1023/OF THE COUNCIL OF MAY ESTABLISHING A COMMON PROCEDURE FOR ADMINISTERING QUANTITATIVE QUOTAS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ).   THOSE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED IN AN ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN HANDELSONDERNEMING C . TONEMAN BV , THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION , ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' ' TONEMAN ' ' ) AND THE MINISTER FOR ECONOMIC AFFAIRS OF THE NETHERLANDS CONCERNING THE REFUSAL OF THE COMPETENT NETHERLANDS AUTHORITIES TO GRANT AN IMPORTER LICENCES FOR THE IMPORT OF HANDKERCHIEFS FROM CZECHOSLOVAKIA .   IN THE IMPORTATION OF HANDKERCHIEFS INTO THE NETHERLANDS FROM CZECHOSLOVAKIA , WHICH ALREADY REQUIRED THE ISSUE OF IMPORT LICENCES , BECAME SUBJECT TO A QUOTA SYSTEM . THE QUOTA IN QUESTION HAD BEEN ADOPTED ON THE BASIS OF COUNCIL DECISION 79/252/EEC OF DECEMBER AMENDING THE UNILATERAL IMPORT ARRANGEMENTS IN RESPECT OF STATE-TRADING COUNTRIES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ). IN ARTICLE THEREOF THAT DECISION PROVIDED THAT MEMBER STATES WERE TO OPEN IMPORT QUOTAS AND , IN ANNEX IX THERETO , THAT THE QUOTA FOR THE IMPORT OF HANDKERCHIEFS FROM CZECHOSLOVAKIA INTO THE BENELUX COUNTRIES WAS TO BE ITEMS . ACCORDING TO THE ORDER MAKING THE REFERENCE FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING , THE NETHERLANDS MINISTER FOR ECONOMIC AFFAIRS DECIDED TO DISTRIBUTE THAT PART OF THE BENELUX COUNTRIES '  QUOTA ALLOCATED TO THE NETHERLANDS ON THE BASIS OF IMPORTS OF HANDKERCHIEFS FROM CZECHOSLOVAKIA DURING . SINCE THE IMPORTER CONCERNED IN THIS CASE HAD NOT IMPORTED HANDKERCHIEFS FROM CZECHOSLOVAKIA DURING THE REFERENCE PERIOD THE IMPORT LICENCES FOR FOR WHICH THE IMPORTER APPLIED WERE REFUSED .   TONEMAN APPEALED TO THE COLLEGE VAN BEROEP VOOR HET BEDRIJFSLEVEN AGAINST THAT REFUSAL ON THE GROUND THAT THE DECISION OF DECEMBER ON THE OPENING OF THE QUOTA IN QUESTION , WHICH ENTERED INTO FORCE ON JANUARY , HAD NOT BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES UNTIL MARCH , THAT THE NETHERLANDS AUTHORITIES HAD     NEVER GIVEN ANY GENERAL NOTIFICATION OF THE IMPOSITION OF THE QUOTAS IN QUESTION , AND THAT THE TRADERS CONCERNED HAD NOT BEEN INFORMED OF THAT MEASURE IN GOOD TIME .   THE COLLEGE VAN BEROEP VOOR HET BEDRIJFSLEVEN TOOK THE VIEW THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE DISPUTE DEPENDED ON THE INTERPRETATION OF COMMUNITY PROVISIONS ON THE IMPOSITION OF QUOTAS AND REFERRED TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING TWO QUESTIONS ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1023/OF THE COUNCIL AND THE EFFECTS OF ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THAT PROVISION .   THE FIRST OF THOSE QUESTIONS IS WORDED AS FOLLOWS :    ' ' MUST REGULATION NO 1023/OF THE COUNCIL BE INTERPRETED TO MEAN THAT THE PROVISION CONCERNING PUBLICATION CONTAINED IN ARTICLE OF THE REGULATION APPLIES TO THE IMPORT QUOTAS TO BE OPENED BY THE MEMBER STATES PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF COUNCIL DECISION 79/OF DECEMBER ' ' ?    ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1023/PROVIDES THAT ' ' NOT LATER THAN THREE WEEKS AFTER EACH QUOTA ALLOCATION THE MEMBER STATES SHALL MAKE KNOWN , BY OFFICIAL PUBLICATION , THE PRODUCTS WHICH MAY BE IMPORTED OR EXPORTED AND THE PROCEDURE WHEREBY IMPORT OR EXPORT OF SUCH PRODUCTS IS TO BE AUTHORIZED ' ' .   THE COMMISSION AND THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT CONSIDER THAT THAT PROVISION APPLIES ONLY TO COMMUNITY QUOTAS AND NOT TO NATIONAL QUOTAS WHICH IN CERTAIN CASES CONTINUE TO EXIST , WITH THE COMMUNITY ' S PERMISSION , IN REGARD TO STATE-TRADING COUNTRIES . THE QUOTA INVOLVED IN THIS CASE IS SUCH A NATIONAL QUOTA .   THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION SUBMITTED BY THE NATIONAL COURT SHOULD BE SOUGHT BOTH WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE COMMUNITY PROVISIONS ON THE IMPOSITION OF QUOTAS AND FROM THE WORDING OF THOSE PROVISIONS .   WHEN A COMMON COMMERCIAL POLICY WAS INTRODUCED AFTER THE EXPIRY OF THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD , REGULATION NO 1023/OF THE COUNCIL LAID DOWN , IN THE CASE OF PRODUCTS WHOSE IMPORT WAS NOT LIBERALIZED , COMMUNITY PROVISIONS ON QUANTITATIVE IMPORT QUOTAS AND IN PARTICULAR IT SPECIFIED THE PROCEDURES BY WHICH THOSE QUOTAS ARE TO BE FIXED AND ALLOCATED BY THE COUNCIL AND     ADMINISTERED BY THE MEMBER STATES . HOWEVER , SINCE IT DID NOT APPEAR POSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH A COMMUNITY SYSTEM IN ALL CASES , COUNCIL DECISIONS ALLOWED MEMBER STATES TO RETAIN THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN NATIONAL QUOTA ARRANGEMENTS IN CERTAIN CASES . THAT WAS SO IN PARTICULAR IN THE CASE OF COUNCIL DECISION 75/OF MARCH ON UNILATERAL IMPORT ARRANGEMENTS IN RESPECT OF STATE-TRADING COUNTRIES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), AS AMENDED BY COUNCIL DECISION 79/OF DECEMBER , PURSUANT TO WHICH THE QUOTA IN ISSUE WAS IMPOSED IN THE NETHERLANDS . ACCORDING TO THE RECITALS IN THE PREAMBLE TO DECISION 75/, THOSE ARRANGEMENTS ARE TO APPLY PENDING THE CONCLUSION OF TRADE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND THE VARIOUS STATE-TRADING COUNTRIES COVERING INTER ALIA THE ARRANGEMENTS TO BE APPLIED TO IMPORTS INTO THE COMMUNITY FROM THOSE COUNTRIES AND COMMON IMPORT ARRANGEMENTS ARE TO BE GRADUALLY INTRODUCED .   IT IS IN KEEPING WITH THE EXISTENCE OF TWO KINDS OF QUOTA ARRANGEMENTS THAT BY VIRTUE OF ARTICLE THEREOF THE PROVISIONS OF REGULATION NO 1023/APPLY ' ' TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF ALL QUANTITATIVE IMPORT QUOTAS . . ., WHETHER AUTONOMOUS OR CONVENTIONAL , ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMUNITY ' '  AND THEREFORE , AS IS STATED IN THE SECOND RECITAL IN ITS PREAMBLE , TO ' ' COMMUNITY QUOTAS ' ' , WHEREAS THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF DECISION 75/, AS AMENDED BY ARTICLE OF DECISION 79/, PROVIDES THAT THE QUOTAS INVOLVED IN THE CASE OF MEASURES TAKEN PURSUANT TO THAT PROVISION ARE QUOTAS WHICH ' ' THE MEMBER STATES SHALL OPEN ' '  AND THEREFORE NATIONAL QUOTAS .   FURTHERMORE , THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF DECISION 75/STATES THAT ' ' MEMBER STATES '  RULES GOVERNING THE OPENING AND ADMINISTRATION OF QUOTAS ' '  ARE NOT TO BE AFFECTED . ACCORDINGLY , THE RULES AND PROCEDURES WHICH HAD TO BE OBSERVED BY THE NETHERLANDS AUTHORITIES WHEN ADOPTING THE QUOTA MEASURE IN ISSUE , PARTICULARLY THOSE CONCERNING ANY PUBLICATION OF THE MEASURE , WERE THOSE STIPULATED BY THE APPLICABLE NATIONAL LAW AND NOT THOSE LAID DOWN BY REGULATION NO 1023/IN THE CASE OF COMMUNITY QUOTAS .   THE ANSWER TO THE FIRST QUESTION PUT BY THE COLLEGE VAN BEROEP VOOR HET BEDRIJFSLEVEN SHOULD THEREFORE BE THAT ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1023/OF THE COUNCIL DOES NOT APPLY TO IMPORT QUOTAS TO BE OPENED BY MEMBER STATES IN REGARD TO STATE-TRADING COUNTRIES UNDER ARTICLE OF COUNCIL DECISION 79/OF DECEMBER .        SINCE THE SECOND QUESTION PUT BY THE COLLEGE VAN BEROEP VOOR HET BEDRIJFSLEVEN WAS PUT ONLY IN THE EVENT OF THE FIRST QUESTION ' S BEING ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE , THAT QUESTION NO LONGER HAS ANY PURPOSE .
