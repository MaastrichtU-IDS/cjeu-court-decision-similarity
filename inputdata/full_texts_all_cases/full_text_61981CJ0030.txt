Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR DECLARATIONS THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY BY FAILING TO IMPLEMENT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD FIVE DIRECTIVES CONCERNING THE ENVIRONMENT PROGRAMME , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATIONS LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON AND FEBRUARY AND ON APRIL , THE COMMISSION BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT , PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY , FIVE ACTIONS FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAD FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY BY FAILING TO ADOPT , WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIODS , THE PROVISIONS NEEDED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE FOLLOWING DIRECTIVES :  ( A ) COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 75/439/EEC OF JUNE ON THE DISPOSAL OF WASTE OILS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . );   ( B)COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 75/440/EEC OF JUNE CONCERNING THE QUALITY REQUIRED OF SURFACE WATER INTENDED FOR THE ABSTRACTION OF DRINKING WATER IN THE MEMBER STATES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . );      ( C)COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 75/442/EEC OF JULY ON WASTE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . );   ( D)COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 76/160/EEC OF DECEMBER CONCERNING THE QUALITY OF BATHING WATER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . );   ( E)COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 76/403/EEC OF APRIL ON THE DISPOSAL OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS AND POLYCHLORINATED TERPHENYLS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ).    EACH DIRECTIVE LAID DOWN THAT THE MEMBER STATES WERE TO BRING INTO FORCE THE MEASURES NEEDED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH IT WITHIN A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS . THE PERIOD EXPIRED , IN THE CASE OF THE FIRST TWO DIRECTIVES ( 75/439/EEC AND 75/440/EEC ), ON JUNE AND , IN THE CASE OF THE OTHERS ( 75/442/EEC , 76/160/EEC AND 76/403/EEC ), ON JULY , DECEMBER AND APRIL RESPECTIVELY .   THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DISPUTE THAT IT HAS FAILED TO FULFIL THAT OBLIGATION . IT STATES THAT THE DELAY IN IMPLEMENTING THE DIRECTIVES STEMS FROM THE NEED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE ADOPTION OF LEGISLATION IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE SAID DIRECTIVES , A PROCEDURE WHICH ENTAILS THE OBSERVANCE OF CERTAIN TIME-LIMITS DETERMINED BY THE REQUIREMENTS AND EVENTS INHERENT IN THE PARLIAMENTARY PROCESS . FACES WITH THOSE DIFFICULTIES , THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS ASKED PARLIAMENT FOR A DELEGATION OF LEGISLATIVE POWERS . ALTHOUGH THE DELEGATION HAS ALREADY BEEN APPROVED BY THE SENATE IT IS STILL BEING EXAMINED BY THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES .   THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES DO NOT EXPUNGE THE FAILURE TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS WITH WHICH THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC IS CHARGED . ACCORDING TO WELL-ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW , A MEMBER STATE MAY NOT PLEAD PROVISIONS , PRACTICES OR CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING IN ITS INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OBLIGATIONS AND TIME-LIMITS RESULTING FROM COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES .   THEREFORE IT MUST BE HELD THAT BY FAILING TO ADOPT , WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD , THE PROVISIONS NEEDED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVES 75/439/EEC AND 75/440/EEC OF JUNE , 75/442/EEC OF JULY     , 76/160/EEC OF DECEMBER AND 76/403/EEC OF APRIL , THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY .  
Decision on costs
