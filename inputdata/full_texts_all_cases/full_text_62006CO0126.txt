(Case C‑126/06)
Free movement of goods – Article EC – Quantitative restrictions – Measures having equivalent effect – Marketing of frozen bakery products
Free movement of goods – Quantitative restrictions – Measures having equivalent effect (Art. EC) (see para. and operative part)
Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Diikitiko Protodikio Tripolis – Interpretation of Art. EC – Marketing of pre‑cooked
                  bakery products (‘bake‑off’ products) – Requirement of a licence.
               
Operative part 
The Court:
Article EC must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which makes the sale of ‘bake‑off’ products subject to
         the same requirements as those applicable to the complete process of manufacturing and marketing bread and traditional bakery
         products.
