Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF HEADINGS NOS 58.AND 59.OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF , 
Grounds
BY ORDER OF APRIL , WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON MAY , THE BUNDESFINANZHOF ( FEDERAL FINANCE COURT ) REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY A QUESTION ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF .   THAT QUESTION WAS RAISED IN THE COURSE OF A DISPUTE CONCERNING THE TARIFF CLASSIFICATION OF A PRODUCT DESCRIBED AS A ' ' MAT FOR TRAPPING DIRT ' '  ( ' ' SCHMUTZFANGMATTE ' ' ) WHICH , ACCORDING TO THE IMPORTING FIRM , IS A PRODUCT MADE OF     BONDED FIBRE FABRIC OR SIMILAR BONDED YARN FABRIC COVERED BY TARIFF HEADING NO 59., BUT WHICH THE COMPETENT CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES CLASSIFIED IN A BINDING CUSTOMS TARIFF NOTIFICATION UNDER SUBHEADING NO 58.A II ( B ).   HEADING NO 59.OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF COMPRISES BONDED FIBRE FABRICS , SIMILAR BONDED YARN FABRICS , AND ARTICLES OF SUCH FABRICS , WHETHER OR NOT IMPREGNATED OR COATED . CHAPTER , TO WHICH THAT HEADING BELONGS , COVERS WADDING AND FELT , TWINE , CORDAGE , ROPES AND CABLES , SPECIAL FABRICS , IMPREGNATED AND COATED FABRICS , AND TEXTILE ARTICLES OF A KIND SUITABLE FOR INDUSTRIAL USE .   CHAPTER OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF ENCOMPASSES CARPETS , MATS , MATTING AND TAPESTRIES , PILE AND CHENILLE FABRICS , NARROW FABRICS , TRIMMINGS , TULLE AND OTHER NET FABRICS , LACE AND EMBROIDERY . HEADING NO 58.COVERS KNOTTED CARPETS , CARPETING AND RUGS ( MADE UP OR NOT ) AND HEADING NO 58.OTHER CARPETS , CARPETING , RUGS , MATS AND MATTING , AND ' ' KELEM ' ' , ' ' SCHUMACKS ' '  AND ' ' KARAMANIE ' '  RUGS AND THE LIKE ( MADE UP OR NOT ). SUBHEADING 58.A IS WORDED AS FOLLOWS :    ' ' A . CARPETS , CARPETING , RUGS , MATS AND MATTING :    I . COIR MATS AND MATTING   II.OTHER :    ( A ) TUFTED CARPETS , CARPETING , RUGS , MATS AND MATTING   ( B)OTHER . ' '   IN THE QUESTION WHICH IT PUTS TO THE COURT THE BUNDESFINANZHOF DESCRIBES THE PRODUCT AT ISSUE AS FOLLOWS : ' ' AN ARTICLE CONSISTING OF A FABRIC WHICH IS MADE OF PVC MONOFIL 0.MM THICK , LAID DIRECT FROM A SPINNING NOZZLE IN THE FORM OF COILS AND HARDENED AND JOINED TOGETHER BY HEAT TREATMENT WITH THE AID OF A SPRAY ' ' . THE PRODUCT IS TO BE IMPORTED IN STRIPS CM AND CM WIDE AND CM LONG FOR USE AS A FLOOR COVERING ( MAT FOR TRAPPING DIRT ).   THE NATIONAL COURT ASKS WHETHER SUCH A PRODUCT FALLS UNDER HEADING NO 58.OR HEADING NO 59.OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF .       NOTE TO CHAPTER STATES THAT THE CHAPTER IS NOT TO BE TAKEN TO APPLY TO COATED OR IMPREGNATED FABRICS , ELASTIC FABRICS OR ELASTIC TRIMMINGS , MACHINERY BELTING OR ' ' OTHER GOODS FALLING WITHIN CHAPTER . ' '   IT FOLLOWS THAT A PRODUCT WHICH , BY VIRTUE OF ITS COMPOSITION , MIGHT BE CLASSIFIED UNDER CHAPTER DOES NOT FALL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF CHAPTER SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS USED AS A FLOOR COVERING .   IT IS TRUE THAT , ACCORDING TO NOTE TO CHAPTER , THE WORDS ' ' CARPETS ' '  AND ' ' RUGS ' '  IN HEADINGS NOS 58.AND 58.ARE TO BE TAKEN TO EXTEND TO SIMILAR ARTICLES HAVING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF FLOOR COVERINGS BUT INTENDED FOR USE FOR OTHER PURPOSES . THAT PROVISION , HOWEVER , AS THE COMMISSION HAS RIGHTLY POINTED OUT , IS INTENDED TO DEFINE THE MEANING OF ' ' CARPETS ' '  AND ' ' RUGS ' '  FOR THE PURPOSE OF INTERPRETING HEADINGS NOS 58.AND 58.AND NOT TO CREATE AN EXCEPTION , IN THE CASE OF CARPETS AND RUGS , TO THE SYSTEM OF CLASIFICATION LAID DOWN IN NOTE .    A FURTHER ARGUMENT SUPPORTING THE SAME CONCLUSION IS PROVIDED BY THE SECOND SENTENCE OF NOTE , WHICH STATES THAT FELT CARPETS FALL WITHIN CHAPTER . THAT PROVISION MAKES IT CLEAR THAT , IN CLASSIFYING A FLOOR COVERING , IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE REGARD TO THE NATURE OF THE PRODUCT AND ITS METHOD OF MANUFACTURE RATHER THAN TO THE USE TO WHICH IT MAY BE PUT .   THAT INTERPRETATION IS CONFIRMED BY THE FACT THAT THE PRODUCTS WHICH ARE EXPRESSLY REFERRED TO IN CHAPTER ARE SIMILAR INASMUCH AS THEY ARE MANUFACTURED BY KNOTTING , WEAVING , NETTING OR KNITTING , WHEREAS BONDED FABRICS ARE MADE UP OF FIBRES OR YARNS WHICH ARE JOINED TOGETHER BY A CHEMICAL PROCESS OR BY HEAT TREATMENT .   IT FOLLOWS FROM THE FOREGOING THAT THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF MUST BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT A PRODUCT CONSISTING OF A FABRIC WHICH IS MADE OF POLYVINYL CHLORIDE MONOFIL 0.MM THICK , LAID DIRECT FROM A SPINNING NOZZLE IN THE FORM OF COILS AND HARDENED AND JOINED TOGETHER BY HEAT TREATMENT WITH THE AID OF A SPRAY , BEING A BONDED FIBRE FABRIC OR SIMILAR BONDED YARN FABRIC , FALLS UNDER HEADING NO 59., EVEN IF IT IS INTENDED FOR USE AS A FLOOR COVERING .
