Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION OF AUGUST ( IV/30.- DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM OF FORD WERKE AG - INTERIM MEASURES ), 
Grounds
BY COMMUNICATION OF JULY , THE COMMISSION INFORMED FORD WERKE AG THAT IT HAD DECIDED TO INITIATE A PROCEEDING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY IN REGARD TO THAT UNDERTAKING BECAUSE THE LATTER HAD ON APRIL SENT TO GERMAN FORD DEALERS A CIRCULAR IN WHICH IT INFORMED THEM THAT , AFTER MAY , IT WOULD NO LONGER ACCEPT ANY ORDERS FOR RIGHT-HAND DRIVE MOTOR CARS WHICH THOSE DEALERS MIGHT FORWARD TO IT .   ON AUGUST , WHILST THAT PROCEDURE WAS STILL IN PROGRESS , THE COMMISSION ADOPTED A DECISION HEADED IV/30.- DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM OF FORD WERKE AG - INTERIM MEASURES . THAT DECISION WAS NOTIFIED TO THE APPLICANT ON AUGUST .    ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF THE DECISION FORD WERKE AG IS REQUIRED TO WITHDRAW THE CIRCULAR OF APRIL . ACCORDING TO THE SAME PROVISION FORD WERKE AG IS REQUIRED TO INFORM GERMAN FORD DEALERS THAT RIGHT-HAND DRIVE VEHICLES STILL FORM PART OF ITS AGREED DELIVERY RANGE AND TO REFRAIN FOR THE FUTURE FROM TAKING ANY MEASURES HAVING THE SAME EFFECT AS THE CIRCULAR . THE DECISION ENTERS INTO FORCE DAYS FROM THE DATE OF ITS NOTIFICATION AND ACCORDING TO ARTICLE IS TO APPLY UNTIL ADOPTION OF A DECISION CONCLUDING THE PROCEEDINGS INSTITUTED PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY . ARTICLE OF THE DECISION PROVIDES THAT A PERIODIC PENALTY PAYMENT OF EUROPEAN CURRENCY UNITS PER DAY IS TO BE PAYABLE BY FORD WERKE AG FOR EACH DAY OF DELAY .   IN THE STATEMENT OF THE GROUNDS ON WHICH THE CONTESTED DECISION IS BASED THE COMMISSION INDICATES THAT THE DECISION IS WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE ONE WHICH IT WILL TAKE UPON THE CONCLUSION OF THE INVESTIGATION WHICH IS BEING CARRIED OUT . THE DECISION IS ALSO WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE APPLICANT MIGHT OBTAIN AN EXEMPTION UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE EEC TREATY . IT IS BASED ON THE PROBABLE EXISTENCE OF AN INFRINGEMENT OF ARTICLE ( ) WHICH , AS A MATTER OF URGENT NECESSITY AND BY WAY OF A CONSERVATORY MEASURE , MUST BE TERMINATED FORTHWITH .   BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON SEPTEMBER THE APPLICANT HAS BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION OF AUGUST IS VOID . BY A SEPARATE DOCUMENT LODGED AT THE     COURT REGISTRY ON THE SAME DAY THE APPLICANT APPLIED , IN PURSUANCE OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY AND ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE , FOR THE SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF THE CONTESTED DECISION .   ACCORDING TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT MAY GRANT THE APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES EVEN BEFORE THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE OPPOSITE PARTY HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED . SUCH A DECISION MAY BY VARIED OR CANCELLED EVEN WITHOUT ANY APPLICATION ' S BEING MADE BY ANY PARTY .   AS THE COURT HAS RECOGNIZED IN ITS ORDER OF JANUARY MADE UPON AN APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES ( CASE 792/79R CAMERA CARE V COMMISSION ( ) ECR ) IT IS OPEN TO THE COMMISSION TO ADOPT , IN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES , CERTAIN INTERIM MEASURES IN THE COURSE OF PROCEEDINGS UNDER ARTICLE . HOWEVER , THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE COMMISSION HAS ISSUED A MEASURE OF THIS KIND ON ITS OWN INITIATIVE WHILST AN INVESTIGATION IS IN PROGRESS .   IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES , AND HAVING REGARD TO THE PARTICULAR FEATURES OF THIS DISPUTE , IT IS DESIRABLE IN THE INTERESTS OF THE PROPER ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE NOT TO PUT THIS MEASURE INTO EFFECT BEFORE THE PARTIES HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF STATING THEIR VIEWS DURING THESE PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO AN APPLICATION FOR INTERIM MEASURES . IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO SUSPEND , AS A CONSERVATORY MEASURE , THE OPERATION OF ARTICLES AND OF THE CONTESTED DECISION UNTIL THE MAKING OF THE ORDER TERMINATING THESE PROCEEDINGS .  
Operative part

THE OPERATION OF ARTICLES AND OF THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION OF AUGUST RELATING TO A PROCEEDING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY ( IV/30.- DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM OF FORD WERKE AG - INTERIM MEASURES ) SHALL , AS A CONSERVATORY MEASURE , BE SUSPENDED UNTIL THE MAKING OF THE ORDER TERMINATING THESE PROCEEDINGS WITH REGARD TO THE APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES .      2.THE PROCEEDINGS WITH REGARD TO THE APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES SHALL BE PURSUED IMMEDIATELY .
