Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Najvyšší súd Slovenskej republiky – Interpretation of the first subparagraph of Article
                  4(5) of Directive 77/388/EEC: Sixth Council Directive of May on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States
                  relating to turnover taxes – Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment (OJ L 145, p. 1) – Treatment
                  of a body governed by public law as a non-taxable person in respect of activities or operations engaged in as a public authority
                  – Inclusion of bailiffs in the exercise of their public duties – Direct effect.
               
Operative part
An activity exercised by a private individual, such as that of a bailiff, is not exempted from value added tax merely because
         it consists in engaging in acts falling within the rights and powers of a public authority. Even on the assumption that, in
         the exercise of his duties, a bailiff does carry out such acts, he does not, under legislation such as that at issue in the
         main proceedings, exercise his activity in the form of a body governed by public law, not being integrated into the organisation
         of the public administration, but in the form of an independent economic activity carried out in a self-employed capacity,
         and, consequently, he is not covered by the exemption provided for in the first subparagraph of Article 4(5) of Sixth Council
         Directive 77/388/EEC of May on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes – Common
         system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment.
