IN CASE 92/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE HIGH COURT OF IRELAND FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  AN BORD BAINNE CO-OPERATIVE LIMITED ( THE IRISH DAIRY BOARD )   AND  THE MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE  
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION AND THE VALIDITY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF REGULATIONS NO 685/AND NO 2517/OF THE COMMISSION CONCERNING PRIVATE STORAGE AID FOR BUTTER AND CREAM , 
Grounds
1BY AN ORDER DATED JULY , RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON JULY , THE HIGH COURT OF IRELAND HAS REFERRED TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE INTERPRETATION OF REGULATION NO 685/OF THE COMMISSION OF APRIL ON DETAILED RULES OF APPLICATION FOR INTERVENTION ON THE MARKET IN BUTTER AND CREAM ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ), AND ON THE VALIDITY OF REGULATION NO 2514/OF THE COMMISSION OF OCTOBER , WHICH ENTERED INTO FORCE ON OCTOBER , AMENDING REGULATION NO 685/AS REGARDS THE ADJUSTMENT OF PRIVATE STORAGE AID FOR BUTTER TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF CHANGES IN THE BUYING-IN PRICE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ).   2THESE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN REFERRED IN THE CONTEXT OF PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY AN IRISH CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETY WITH LIMITED LIABILITY , CARRYING ON THE BUSINESS OF MARKETING MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS , AGAINST THE MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES , WHO IS THE INTERVENTION AGENCY IN IRELAND FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY .   3THE DISPUTE BETWEEN THE PARTIES CONCERNS THE AMOUNT OF AID WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN PAID FOR CERTAIN QUANTITIES OF BUTTER AND CREAM WHICH THE PLAINTIFF CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETY HAD STORED PRIVATELY , UNDER ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 804/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ), AND WHICH HAD NOT YET BEEN REMOVED FROM STORAGE ON OCTOBER .    4THE SAID CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETY CLAIMS THAT ALTHOUGH THE AMOUNT OF THE AID HAS BEEN REDUCED OWING TO THE NEW BUYING-IN PRICE FOR BUTTER EXPRESSED IN UNITS OF ACCOUNT LAID DOWN BY REGULATION NO 2469/OF THE COUNCIL OF OCTOBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) AS FROM OCTOBER , THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE SAID AMOUNT HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY THE ALTERATION OF THE REPRESENTATIVE EXCHANGE RATE FOR THE IRISH ' ' GREEN ' '  POUND ENACTED BY REGULATION NO 2498/OF THE COUNCIL OF OCTOBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) ALSO AS FROM OCTOBER .    5ON THE OTHER HAND , THE INTERVENTION AGENCY CONTENDS THAT THE BUYING-IN PRICE FOR BUTTER IN IRELAND , AS APPLIED BEFORE OCTOBER , HAS UNDERGONE A DOUBLE INCREASE , AS ITS LEVEL HAS BEEN RAISED BOTH IN UNITS OF ACCOUNT AND IN IRISH NATIONAL CURRENCY , THROUGH THE COMBINED EFFECT OF THE TWO COUNCIL REGULATIONS AFOREMENTIONED .   6IT CONTENDS THAT , OWING TO THAT INCREASE AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 685/OF THE COMMISSION , AS SUPPLEMENTED BY REGULATION NO 2517/OF THE COMMISSION , NO AID IS DUE TO THE PLAINTIFF CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETY IN RESPECT OF THE QUANTITIES OF BUTTER AND CREAM STILL IN STORAGE ON THE AFOREMENTIONED DATE .   7IN THE FIRST TWO QUESTIONS , THE HIGH COURT ASKS WHETHER REGULATION NO 2498/OF THE COUNCIL , WHICH ALTERED THE EXCHANGE RATE BETWEEN THE IRISH POUND AND THE UNIT OF ACCOUNT , HAD THE EFFECT OF INCREASING THE ' ' BUYING-IN PRICE FOR BUTTER ' '  WITHIN THE MEANING OF THAT EXPRESSION AS USED IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 685/OF THE COMMISSION , AS AMENDED BY REGULATIONS NO 1064/AND NO 603/OF THE COMMISSION , AND WHETHER SUCH INCREASE TOOK PLACE INDEPENDENTLY OF OR BY VIRTUE OF THE PROVISIONS OF REGULATION NO 2517/OF THE COMMISSION .   8REGULATION NO 2498/ALTERING THE REPRESENTATIVE CONVERSION RATE FOR THE IRISH GREEN POUND WHICH HAD BEEN FIXED BY REGULATION NO 222/OF THE COUNCIL OF JANUARY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), APPLIES , ACCORDING TO ARTICLE THEREOF , TO ' ' TRANSACTIONS TO BE CARRIED OUT IN PURSUANCE OF INTRUMENTS RELATING TO THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY ' ' .   9THE ANNEX TO REGULATION NO 1134/OF THE COUNCIL OF JULY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P . ) TO WHICH THE FOURTH RECITAL IN THE PREAMBLE TO REGULATION NO 2498/REFERS , DOES NOT MENTION THE BUYING-IN PRICE APPLIED BY THE INTERVENTION AGENCIES AMONG THE AMOUNTS TO BE ADJUSTED IN THE CASE OF AN ALTERATION OF THE PARITY OF THE NATIONAL CURRENCY OF A MEMBER STATE IN RELATION TO THE UNIT OF ACCOUNT .   10THEREFORE REGULATION NO 2498/, CONSIDERED SOLELY IN RELATION TO THE REGULATIONS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF WHICH IT WAS ADOPTED , CANNOT HAVE HAD THE EFFECT OF BRINGING ABOUT AN INCREASE IN THE BUYING-IN PRICE FOR BUTTER EXPRESSED IN IRISH NATIONAL CURRENCY .   11ON THE OTHER HAND , A CHANGE IN THE BUYING-IN PRICE DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE PARITY BETWEEN THE UNIT OF ACCOUNT AND A NATIONAL CURRENCY IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR BY ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 685/, AS SUPPLEMENTED BY REGULATION NO 2517/OF THE COMMISSION .   12THE AFORESAID ARTICLE LAYS DOWN THAT THE AMOUNT OF AID FOR THE PRIVATE STORAGE OF BUTTER SHALL BE INCREASED OR DECREASED BY REASON OF ANY CORRESPONDING CHANGE IN THE BUYING-IN PRICE EXPRESSED IN UNITS OF ACCOUNT , AND GOES ON TO PROVIDE IN THE LAST SUBPARAGRAPH THAT   ' ' THE PROVISIONS OF THE PRECEDING SUBPARAGRAPHS SHALL ALSO APPLY IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE IN THE BUYING-IN PRICE FOR BUTTER , EXPRESSED IN NATIONAL CURRENCY , APPLIED BY THE INTERVENTION AGENCY ' ' .   13REGULATION NO 2517/, PROVIDING FOR THE ADDITION OF THIS LAST SUBPARAGRAPH TO ARTICLE , ENTERED INTO FORCE ON OCTOBER AND WAS THEREFORE APPLICABLE WHEN REGULATION NO 2498/, ADOPTED ON OCTOBER , ENTERED INTO FORCE .   14THEREFORE THE APPROPRIATE ANSWER TO THE FIRST TWO QUESTIONS IS THAT REGULATION NO 2498/OF THE COUNCIL OF OCTOBER BROUGHT ABOUT AN INCREASE IN THE BUYING-IN PRICE FOR BUTTER EXPRESSED IN IRISH POUNDS , BY VIRTUE OF THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 685/OF THE COMMISSION OF APRIL , AS SUPPLEMENTED BY REGULATION NO 2517/OF THE COMMISSION OF OCTOBER .    15IN ITS THIRD QUESTION , THE HIGH COURT ASKS WHETHER , IF REGULATION NO 2498/OF THE COUNCIL IS TO BE INTERPRETED AS HAVING BROUGHT ABOUT AN INCREASE IN THE INTERVENTION PRICE FOR BUTTER , BY THE EFFECT OF THE PROVISIONS OF REGULATION NO 2517/OF THE COMMISSION , THE LATTER REGULATION IS TO BE REGARDED AS VALID AND BINDING IN RELATION TO PRIVATE STORAGE CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO BEFORE ITS ENTRY INTO FORCE .   16THE SYSTEM OF AID FOR THE PRIVATE STORAGE OF BUTTER PROVIDED FOR BY ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 804/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE IS ONE OF THE INTERVENTION MEASURES INTRODUCED BY THAT REGULATION IN ORDER TO ATTAIN THE OBJECTIVES OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY WHICH ARE REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .   17THE SIXTH AND THE LAST RECITALS IN THE PREAMBLE TO REGULATION NO 985/OF THE COUNCIL OF JULY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ) STATE THAT SUCH MEASURES ' ' MUST TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MARKET SITUATION ' '  AND , IN THE CASE OF PRIVATE STORAGE IN PARTICULAR , ' ' MUST CONTRIBUTE TO THE ATTAINMENT OF A BALANCED MARKET ' ' .   18TO THAT END , ARTICLE OF THE REGULATION PROVIDES THAT THE AMOUNT OF PRIVATE STORAGE AID MAY BE ALTERED IF , AT THE TIME OF REMOVAL FROM STORE , THE STATE OF THE MARKET HAS DEVELOPED UNFAVOURABLY UNDER CONDITIONS WHICH COULD NOT BE FORESEEN .   19LIKE THAT PROVISION , THE FIRST VERSION OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 685/OF THE COMMISSION PROVIDED THAT , ' ' SHOULD THE BUYING-IN PRICE FOR BUTTER DECREASE . . ., THE AID SPECIFIED IN ARTICLE SHALL BE INCREASED BY AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THAT DECREASE , IN RESPECT OF QUANTITIES OF BUTTER COVERED BY A CONTRACT AND TAKEN INTO STORE BEFORE THE DATE ON WHICH THE CHANGE IN THE BUYING-IN PRICE BECAME EFFECTIVE ' ' .   20REGULATIONS NOS 880/( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ), 1064/( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ) AND 603/( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ) OF THE COMMISSION SUPPLEMENTED THE SYSTEM THUS INTRODUCED BY PROVIDING THAT THE AMOUNT OF PRIVATE STORAGE AID MAY ALSO BE ALTERED IF THE BUYING-IN PRICE FOR BUTTER APPLIED BY THE INTERVENTION AGENCIES SHOULD INCREASE .   21THOSE RULES ARE THE RESULT OF THE COMMISSION ' S CONCERN TO ENSURE THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR AID FOR PRIVATE STORAGE OF BUTTER SHOULD TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MARKET , SO AS TO ENSURE THAT , AS INTENDED BY THE BASIC REGULATION NO 804/, THE AMOUNT OF AID GRANTED SHOULD CORRESPOND TO THE LEVEL OF ACTUAL PRICES AT THE END OF THE PERIOD OF STORAGE .   22SUCH AN OBJECTIVE WOULD NOT BE ATTAINED IF A CHANGE IN THE BUYING-IN PRICE WERE TO RESULT IN A LOSS OR , CONVERSELY , IN AN UNJUSTIFIED PROFIT FOR A TRADER REMOVING GOODS FROM STORAGE BY COMPARISON IN PARTICULAR WITH TRADERS WHO HAD SOLD INTO INTERVENTION IN THE SAME MARKETING YEAR .   23TREATING A CHANGE IN THE BUYING-IN PRICE EXPRESSED IN NATIONAL CURRENCY IN THE SAME WAY AS A CHANGE IN THAT PRICE EXPRESSED IN UNITS OF ACCOUNT , REGULATION NO 2517/MERELY SUPPLEMENTS THOSE RULES ON THE ADJUSTMENT OF PRIVATE STORAGE AID .   24SINCE EVERY DECREASE OR INCREASE IN THE BUYING-IN PRICE , WHATEVER ITS ORIGIN , IS REFLECTED IN THE MARKET PRICE , PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF A MARKET WITH A SURPLUS SUCH AS THE MARKET IN MILK PRODUCTS , SUCH TREATMENT IN FACT ALLOWS THE AMOUNT OF PRIVATE STORAGE AID TO BE ADJUSTED TO THE REAL AND JUSTIFIED NEEDS OF STORERS .   25THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION CLAIMS THAT REGULATION NO 2517/INTERFERES WITH ITS RIGHTS UNDER PRIVATE STORAGE CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO BEFORE ITS ENTRY INTO FORCE WITH THE COMPETENT NATIONAL INTERVENTION AGENCY , AND IS THEREFORE CONTRARY TO THE PRINCIPLE OF RESPECT FOR VESTED RIGHTS .   26THE MERE FACT OF ENTERING INTO PRIVATE STORAGE CONTRACTS AS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 985/OF THE COUNCIL , AND THE PLACING OF GOODS IN PRIVATE STORAGE CANNOT IN THEMSELVES SUFFICE TO CONFER ANY RIGHT TO PAYMENT OF A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF AID .   27THE PERSON CONCERNED ACQUIRES SUCH A RIGHT ONLY IF THE QUANTITIES OF BUTTER COVERED BY THE STORAGE CONTRACTS HAVE REMAINED IN STORAGE FOR A SPECIFIED MINIMUM PERIOD , IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DETAILED RULES LAID DOWN BY REGULATION NO 685/, AND IF THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT OF STORE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANY CONDITIONS LAID DOWN IN THOSE CONTRACTS , WHICH DID NOT OCCUR IN THIS INSTANCE .   28MOREOVER , ON THE GROUNDS OF PUBLIC INTEREST MENTIONED ABOVE , THE GRANT OF AID FOR PRIVATE STORAGE OF BUTTER IS SUBJECT AT ALL TIMES TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE COMMUNITY RULES RELATING THERETO .   29HENCE , THE COMPLAINT OF INFRINGEMENT OF VESTED RIGHTS AND ALSO THAT OF FAILURE TO HAVE REGARD TO LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION CANNOT BE UPHELD IN THE PRESENT CASE , AND IT IS TO BE CONCLUDED THAT REGULATION NO 2517/OF THE COMMISSION APPLIES TO STORAGE CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO BEFORE THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF REGULATION NO 2498/OF THE COUNCIL , IN RESPECT OF QUANTITIES OF BUTTER NOT YET REMOVED IN THE PROPER MANNER FROM STORAGE ON THAT DATE , NAMELY OCTOBER .    30THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION ALSO CLAIMS THAT THE COMMISSION WAS NOT COMPETENT TO ENACT THE RULES AT ISSUE , AS ONLY THE COUNCIL HAD THE POWER , UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 804/, TO ALTER THE AMOUNT OF PRIVATE STORAGE AID IN RESPONSE TO A CHANGE IN THE REPRESENTATIVE RATE OF THE IRISH GREEN POUND .   31IN THAT CONNEXION , THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION POINTS OUT THAT IT WAS BY A REGULATION OF THE COUNCIL ( REGULATION NO 3141/, OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) THAT IN NOVEMBER THE NETHERLANDS WERE AUTHORIZED TO GRANT FOR STOCKS OF BUTTER AND OF CREAM , WHICH AT THE DATE OF THE DECISION BY THE NETHERLANDS AUTHORITIES TO REVALUE THE GUILDER BY % WERE SUBJECT TO STORAGE CONTRACTS , A SPECIAL AID INTENDED TO COUNTERACT THE LOSS OF VALUE WHICH RESULTED FROM THE APPLICATION OF THE RAISED AGRICULTURAL EXCHANGE RATE FOR THE GUILDER .   32ACCORDING TO ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 804/, ' ' DETAILED RULES FOR THE APPLICATION OF THIS ARTICLE , AND IN PARTICULAR THE AMOUNT OF AID FOR PRIVATE STORAGE , SHALL BE ADOPTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURE LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE ' ' .   33CHARACTERIZED BY THE PRESENCE OF THE ' ' MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE FOR MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS ' ' , THAT PROCEDURE CONFERS RULE-MAKING POWERS ON THE COMMISSION WHICH ENABLE IT TO ADOPT LEGISLATIVE MEASURES IN SUCH FIELDS AS THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR AID FOR PRIVATE STORAGE OF BUTTER .   34SINCE REGULATION NO 2517/RELATES PRECISELY TO THOSE ARRANGEMENTS , THE COMPLAINT OF LACK OF COMPETENCE RAISED IN THE PRESENT CASE IS WITHOUT ANY LEGAL FOUNDATION .   35FINALLY , THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION COMPLAINS THAT THERE IS NO ADEQUATE STATEMENT OF THE REASONS ON WHICH REGULATION NO 2517/IS BASED .   36THE REASONS ON WHICH A PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS BASED MAY APPEAR NOT ONLY FROM ITS OWN WORDING , BUT ALSO FROM THE WHOLE BODY OF THE LEGAL RULES GOVERNING THE FIELD UNDER CONSIDERATION .   37SITUATED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE RULES GOVERNING INTERVENTION ARRANGEMENTS LAID DOWN BY REGULATIONS NO 804/AND NO 985/OF THE COUNCIL , AND MORE PARTICULARLY IN THAT OF PRIVATE STORAGE AID , REGULATION NO 2517/MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO DISCERN THE REASONS JUSTIFYING THE ADDITION OF THE LAST SUBPARAGRAPH TO ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 685/.    38FOR THOSE REASONS , THE APPROPRIATE ANSWER IS THAT CONSIDERATION OF THE THIRD QUESTION RAISED HAS DISCLOSED NO FACTOR OF SUCH A KIND AS TO AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF REGULATION NO 2517/OF THE COMMISSION .   39IN VIEW OF THIS ANSWER , THERE IS NO NEED TO CONSIDER THE FOURTH QUESTION RAISED .
