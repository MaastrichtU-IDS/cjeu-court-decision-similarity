Summary
Articles 189, 190, and of the EC Treaty, which define precisely the nature of and rules applicable to the legal measures that may be adopted by the Community institutions, do not impose on those institutions any general obligation to inform the addressees of those measures of the judicial remedies available or of the time-limits for availing themselves thereof. In the absence of express provisions of Community law, the Community administration and judicature cannot be placed under any such general obligation.
