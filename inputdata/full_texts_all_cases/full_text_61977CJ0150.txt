CONVENTION OF SEPTEMBER ON JURISDICTION AND THE ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS IN CIVIL AND COMMMERCIAL MATTERS - JURISDICTION IN THE CASE OF SALES AND LOANS ON INSTALMENTS - CONCEPT OF ' ' SALE OF GOODS ON INSTALMENT CREDIT TERMS ' '  - INDEPENDENT CLASSIFICATION WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE CONVENTION - DESCRIPTION  ( CONVENTION OF SEPTEMBER , ARTS . AND )   
Summary
SINCE THE CONCEPT OF A CONTRACT OF SALE ON INSTALMENT CREDIT TERMS VARIES FROM ONE MEMBER STATE TO ANOTHER , IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OBJECTIVES PURSUED BY THEIR RESPECTIVE LAWS , IT IS NECESSARY , IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CONVENTION , TO CONSIDER THAT CONCEPT AS BEING INDEPENDENT AND THEREFORE TO GIVE IT A UNIFORM SUBSTANTIVE CONTENT ALLIED TO THE COMMUNITY ORDER .  ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLES COMMON TO THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES , THE SALE OF GOODS ON INSTALMENT CREDIT TERMS IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS A TRANSACTION IN WHICH THE PRICE IS DISCHARGED BY WAY OF SEVERAL PAYMENTS OR WHICH IS LINKED TO A FINANCING CONTRACT . HOWEVER , A RESTRICTIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE CONVENTION , IN CONFORMITY WITH THE OBJECTIVES PURSUED BY SECTION , ENTAILS THE RESTRICTION OF THE JURISDICTIONAL ADVANTAGE FOR WHICH PROVISION IS MADE BY THAT ARTICLE TO BUYERS WHO ARE IN NEED OF PROTECTION , THEIR ECONOMIC POSITION BEING ONE OF WEAKNESS IN COMPARISON WITH SELLERS BY REASON OF THE FACT THAT THEY ARE PRIVATE FINAL CONSUMERS AND ARE NOT ENGAGED , WHEN BUYING THE PRODUCT ACQUIRED ON INSTALMENT CREDIT TERMS , IN TRADE OR PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES .

ONLY IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE DEFENDANT IS DOMICILED ' ' .   9IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IMPERATIVE RULE OF JURIDICTION THE LANDGERICHT STUTTGART , THE COURT IN WHICH THE ORIGINAL JUDGMENT WAS GIVEN , THE TRIBUNAL DE GRANDE INSTANCE , LE MANS , AND THE COUR D ' APPEL , ANGERS , THE COURTS IN WHICH ENFORCEMENT WAS SOUGHT , REFUSED , WHETHER BY IMPLICATION OR EXPRESSLY , IN DEFINING THEIR JURISDICTION , TO CLASSIFY THE CONTRACT OF SALE IN QUESTION AS A CONTRACT FOR THE SALE OF GOODS ON INSTALMENT CREDIT TERMS .   10THE RESERVATIONS OF THE COUR DE CASSATION REGARDING THE PRECISE STATUS OF THE SAID CONTRACT PERSUADED IT TO REFER THE ABOVE-MENTIONED QUESTION TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE .   11BY THAT QUESTION THE COURT IS ASKED WHETHER A CONTRACT OF SALE SUCH AS THAT DESCRIBED IS ENTITLED TO THE PRIVILEGED POSITION WITH REGARD TO JURISDICTION CREATED BY THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE CONVENTION .   12THE CONCEPT OF A CONTRACT OF SALE ON INSTALMENT CREDIT TERMS VARIES FROM ONE MEMBER STATE TO ANOTHER , IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OBJECTIVES PURSUED BY THEIR RESPECTIVE LAWS .   13ALTHOUGH ALL OF THOSE LAWS INCORPORATE THE IDEA OF PROTECTION FOR THE BUYER ' ' ON INSTALMENTS ' '  BECAUSE , IN GENERAL , HE IS THE WEAKER PARTY IN ECONOMIC TERMS IN COMPARISON WITH THE SELLER , CERTAIN OF THEM ARE ALSO BASED ON CONSIDERATIONS OF ECONOMIC , MONETARY AND SAVINGS POLICY , WHICH ARE INTENDED TO CONTROL THE PRACTICE OF SALES ON INSTALMENT CREDIT TERMS , IN PARTICULAR IN RELATION TO CONSUMER DURABLE GOODS ( CARS , HOUSEHOLD ELECTRICAL AND AUDIO-VISUAL EQUIPMENT , ETC .), MOST OFTEN BY THE INDIRECT EXPEDIENT OF PROVISIONS RELATING TO MINIMUM DEPOSITS OR TO THE MAXIMUM DURATION OF CREDIT OR BY LAYING DOWN MINIMUM OR MAXIMUM VALUES FOR THE TOTAL SALE PRICE .   14SINCE THESE VARIOUS OBJECTIVES HAVE LED TO THE CREATION OF DIFFERENT RULES IN THE VARIOUS MEMBER STATES IT IS NECESSARY , FOR THE PURPOSE OF ELIMINATING OBSTACLES TO LEGAL RELATIONS AND TO THE SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES IN THE CONTEXT OF INTRA-COMMUNITY RELATIONS IN MATTERS OF THE SALE OF GOODS ON INSTALMENT CREDIT TERMS , TO CONSIDER THAT CONCEPT AS BEING INDEPENDENT AND THEREFORE COMMON TO ALL THE MEMBER STATES .   15IN FACT , IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE TO GUARANTEE THE HARMONIOUS OPERATION OF ARTICLE ET SEQ . OF THE CONVENTION IF THE EXPRESSION IN QUESTION WERE GIVEN DIFFERENT MEANINGS IN THE VARIOUS MEMBER STATES ACCORDING TO THE COURT FIRST SEISED OF A DISPUTE CONCERNING A CONTRACT FOR THE SALE OF GOODS ON INSTALMENT CREDIT TERMS OR THE COURT HAVING JURISDICTION TO ORDER ENFORCEMENT .   16IT IS THEREFORE INDISPENSABLE , FOR THE COHERENCE OF THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION OF THE CONVENTION , TO GIVE THAT EXPRESSION A UNIFORM SUBSTANTIVE CONTENT ALLIED TO THE COMMUNITY ORDER .   17TO THIS FINDING MUST BE ADDED THE FACT THAT THE COMPULSORY JURISDICTION PROVIDED FOR IN THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE CONVENTION MUST , BECAUSE IT DEROGATES FROM THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE SYSTEM LAID DOWN BY THE CONVENTION IN MATTERS OF CONTRACT , SUCH AS MAY BE DERIVED IN PARTICULAR FROM ARTICLES AND ( ), BE STRICTLY LIMITED TO THE OBJECTIVES PROPER TO SECTION OF THE SAID CONVENTION .   18THOSE OBJECTIVES , AS ENSHRINED IN ARTICLES AND OF THE CONVENTION , WERE INSPIRED SOLELY BY A DESIRE TO PROTECT CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF BUYERS WHO , HAVING BEEN PARTIES TO CONTRACTS FOR THE ' ' SALE OF GOODS ON INSTALMENT CREDIT TERMS ' ' , MAY BE SUED BY THE SELLER ONLY IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE ON THE TERRITORY OF WHICH THE SAID BUYERS ARE DOMICILED , WHEREAS SELLERS DOMICILED ON THE TERRITORY OF A CONTRACTING STATE MAY BE SUED EITHER IN THE COURTS OF THAT STATE OR IN THE COURTS OF THE CONTRACTING STATE IN WHICH THE BUYER IS DOMICILED .   19IN ORDER TO REPLY TO THE QUESTION REFERRED TO THE COURT AN ATTEMPT MUST BE MADE TO ELABORATE AN INDEPENDENT CONCEPT OF THE CONTRACT OF SALE ON INSTALMENT CREDIT TERMS IN VIEW OF THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES WHICH ARE APPARENT IN THIS FIELD FROM THE BODY OF LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES AND BEARING IN MIND THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROTECTION OF A CERTAIN CATEGORY OF BUYERS .   20IT IS CLEAR FROM THE RULES COMMON TO THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES THAT THE SALE OF GOODS ON INSTALMENT CREDIT TERMS IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS A TRANSACTION IN WHICH THE PRICE IS DISCHARGED BY WAY OF SEVERAL PAYMENTS OR WHICH IS LINKED TO A FINANCING CONTRACT .   21A RESTRICTIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE , IN CONFORMITY WITH THE OBJECTIVES PURSUED BY SECTION , ENTAILS THE RESTRICTION OF THE JURISDICTIONAL ADVANTAGE DESCRIBED ABOVE TO BUYERS WHO ARE IN NEED OF PROTECTION , THEIR ECONOMIC POSITION BEING ONE OF WEAKNESS IN COMPARISON WITH SELLERS BY REASON OF THE FACT THAT THEY ARE PRIVATE FINAL CONSUMERS AND ARE NOT ENGAGED , WHEN BUYING THE PRODUCT ACQUIRED ON INSTALMENT CREDIT TERMS , IN TRADE OR PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES .   22THE ANSWER TO BE GIVEN TO THE NATIONAL COURT SHOULD THEREFORE BE THAT THE CONCEPT OF THE SALE OF GOODS ON INSTALMENT CREDIT TERMS WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE BRUSSELS CONVENTION OF SEPTEMBER IS NOT TO BE UNDERSTOOD TO EXTEND TO THE SALE OF A MACHINE WHICH ONE COMPANY AGREES TO MAKE TO ANOTHER COMPANY ON THE BASIS OF A PRICE TO BE PAID BY WAY OF BILLS OF EXCHANGE SPREAD OVER A PERIOD .
