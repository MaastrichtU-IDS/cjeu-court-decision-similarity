Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR ASSESSMENT , UNDER THE RULES ON THE INSURANCE OF OFFICIALS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES AGAINST THE RISK OF ACCIDENT AND OF OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE , OF THE DEGREE OF PERMANENT PARTIAL INVALIDITY FROM WHICH THE APPLICANT IS SUFFERING AS A RESULT OF AN ACCIDENT AND OF THE COMPENSATION TO WHICH HE IS ENTITLED IN RESPECT THEREOF , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JULY , MR MORBELLI , AN OFFICIAL OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ASSIGNED TO THE OFFICE FOR OFFICIAL PUBLICATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , LUXEMBOURG , BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR THE REVIEW OF THE DEGREE OF HIS PERMANENT PARTIAL INVALIDITY FIXED PURSUANT TO THE RULES ON THE INSURANCE OF OFFICIALS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES AGAINST THE RISK OF ACCIDENT AND OF OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE ENACTED UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' ' THE RULES ' ' ).   ON FEBRUARY THE APPLICANT SUFFERED AN ACCIDENT IN THE POST OFFICE NEAR LUXEMBOURG RAILWAY STATION CAUSED BY A FAULTY SLIDING DOOR AS A RESULT OF WHICH HE SUSTAINED HEAD INJURIES . ON FEBRUARY HE REPORTED THE ACCIDENT , PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES , FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE INSURANCE PROVIDED UNDER A CONTRACT ENTERED INTO BY THE COMMUNITY PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   ON MAY , WHEN THE INJURIES APPEARED TO HAVE STABILIZED , THE APPLICANT WAS EXAMINED BY THE MEDICAL ADVISER APPOINTED BY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COMMISSION AND THE INSURER . THAT DOCTOR CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE DEGREE OF PERMANENT INVALIDITY SUFFERED BY THE APPLICANT WAS % . ACCORDINGLY THE INSURER ASSESSED THE COMPENSATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONDITIONS IN THE POLICY AT BFR . THAT OFFER WAS NOTIFIED TO THE APPLICANT ON JULY BY THE COMMISSION .   THE APPLICANT REFUSED THAT OFFER AND THE COMMISSION SENT HIM TO THE HEAD OF ITS MEDICAL DEPARTMENT WHO , AFTER RE-EXAMINING HIM , REACHED THE CONCLUSION THAT THE DEGREE OF INVALIDITY DETERMINED BY THE ABOVE-MENTIONED MEDICAL ADVISER WAS CORRECT . CONSEQUENTLY , IN A LETTER DATED NOVEMBER , THE ADMINISTRATION CONFIRMED ITS ORIGINAL OFFER AND AGAIN EXPRESSED ITS WILLINGNESS TO PAY THE SUM OF BFR .    THE APPLICANT REFUSED TO ACCEPT THAT OFFER AND REQUESTED THAT HIS CASE BE SUBMITTED TO THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF THE RULES . IN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT PROVISION HE APPOINTED ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THAT COMMITTEE , CHOOSING A DOCTOR WHO WAS ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH HIS CASE THROUGH AN ACTION FOR DAMAGES AGAINST THE LUXEMBOURG STATE .       THE COMMISSION LIKEWISE APPOINTED A MEMBER OF THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE AND THE TWO DOCTORS APPOINTED THE THIRD MEMBER BY AGREEMENT , IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE OF THE RULES .   AFTER STUDYING THE FILE AND EXAMINING THE APPLICANT THE COMMITTEE THUS CONSTITUTED DELIVERED ITS OPINION ON JUNE IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS :    ' ' THE UNDERSIGNED . . . HAVING EXAMINED AND HEARD , IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR INSTRUCTIONS , MR GIORGIO MORBELLI , AN OFFICIAL OF THE EEC , PERSONNEL NO , WHO SUFFERED AN ACCIDENT ON FEBRUARY , CONSIDER THAT HIS CONDITION MAY BE REGARDED AS HAVING STABILIZED .  MR MORBELLI MUST BE CONSIDERED TO SUFFER FROM A DEGREE OF PERMANENT PARTIAL INVALIDITY OF % ( THREE PER CENT ) AS AT FEBRUARY . WE HAVE HAD REGARD TO MR MORBELLI ' S GENERAL STATE OF HEALTH .  WE SWEAR THAT WE HAVE PERFORMED OUR TASK PROPERLY , CORRECTLY AND HONESTLY .  BRUSSELS , JUNE .    ( THE NAMES AND SIGNATURES OF THE DOCTORS ). ' '   ON SEPTEMBER THE ADMINISTRATION INFORMED THE APPLICANT OF THE DECISION OF THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE AND REPEATED ITS OFFER OF PAYMENT OF THE LUMP SUM PREVIOUSLY CALCULATED . ON DECEMBER THE APPLICANT SUBMITTED A COMPLAINT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS IN WHICH HE CHALLENGED THE OPINION OF THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE , REQUESTED THE SETTING UP OF A NEW COMMITTEE AND CLAIMED FROM THE INSTITUTION , IN ADDITION TO THE LUMP SUM TO BE FIXED , PAYMENT OF INTEREST FROM THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT AND COMPENSATION FOR THE LOSS WHICH HAD IN THE MEANTIME OCCURRED THROUGH THE FALL IN THE VALUE OF MONEY . A NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS AND MEDICAL REPORTS WERE APPENDED TO THE COMPLAINT ; THE FILE WAS LATER SUPPLEMENTED BY THE LODGING OF A MEDICAL REPORT DRAWN UP AT THE REQUEST OF THE APPLICANT BY PROFESSOR ZANALDA , A PHYSICIAN IN TURIN .       THE COMMISSION DID NOT REPLY TO THAT COMPLAINT WITHIN THE PERIOD LAID DOWN IN THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS . HOWEVER , BY A LETTER OF MAY IT EXPRESSLY REJECTED THE COMPLAINT AND STATED THE REASONS FOR ITS ATTITUDE . THE APPLICATION , WHICH WAS LODGED ON JULY , IS DIRECTED AGAINST THAT LETTER .   FROM THE TERMS OF THE COMPLAINT THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS , READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE APPLICATION , IT IS APPARENT THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE ACTION IS AS FOLLOWS :   - TO OBTAIN THE ANNULMENT OF THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION CONTAINED IN THE LETTER OF MAY ;  - TO OBTAIN A RE-ASSESSMENT OF THE DEGREE OF INVALIDITY , EITHER DIRECTLY BY THE COURT AT % , IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MEDICO-LEGAL OPINION OF PROFESSOR ZANALDA , OR FOLLOWING A NEW EXPERT OPINION TO BE ORDERED BY THE COURT OR BY REFERRING THE MATTER TO ANOTHER MEDICAL COMMITTEE ;  - TO OBTAIN PAYMENT OF INTEREST FROM THE DATE OF THE ACCIDENT TOGETHER WITH AN ADJUSTMENT OF THE LUMP SUM ON THE BASIS OF THE FALL IN THE VALUE OF MONEY WHICH HAS OCCURRED WHILST THE PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN PENDING .   ADMISSIBILITY   THE COMMISSION CONTESTS THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION ON THE GROUND THAT IT IS DIRECTED AGAINST A DECISION WHICH MERELY CONFIRMED A PRIOR DECISION WHICH WAS NOT CHALLENGED . IT RELIES UPON THE FACT THAT THE APPLICATION IS DIRECTED AGAINST A DECISION OF THE COMMISSION REJECTING A COMPLAINT , A DECISION WHICH WAS ADOPTED AFTER THE EXPIRY OF THE PERIOD OF FOUR MONTHS LAID DOWN BY THE LAST SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , AND NOT AGAINST THE IMPLIED DECISION REJECTING IT , WHICH WAS DEEMED TO BE TAKEN ON THE EXPIRY OF THAT PERIOD .   IN THIS CASE THE ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE APPLICANT IS THE COMMUNICATION OF SEPTEMBER WHEREBY THE COMMISSION CONFIRMED THE REPORT OF THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE AND NOTIFIED THE APPLICANT OF ITS DECISION . THE APPLICANT SUBMITTED A COMPLAINT WHICH WAS RECEIVED BY THE SECRETARIAT-GENERAL OF THE COMMISSION ON DECEMBER , THUS SETTING IN MOTION A PERIOD OF FOUR MONTHS WITHIN WHICH THE COMMISSION HAD TO REPLY . THAT PERIOD EXPIRED IN PRINCIPLE ON MAY . IT IS ACCORDINGLY ON THAT DATE THAT AN IMPLIED DECISION TO REJECT THE COMPLAINT IS DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN , WHICH CAUSED A FURTHER PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS TO START TO RUN , WITHIN WHICH THE APPLICANT     WAS ABLE TO LODGE AN APPLICATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   IT IS APPARENT FROM THE FOREGOING THAT THE APPLICANT SUBMITTED HIS APPLICATION WITHIN THE LIMITATION PERIOD SET IN MOTION BY THE IMPLIED DECISION TO REJECT HIS COMPLAINT . THE COMMISSION ' S OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY IS ACCORDINGLY BASED SOLELY ON THE FACT THAT THE APPLICATION IS DIRECTED AGAINST THE SUBSEQUENT EXPRESS DECISION INSTEAD OF THE IMPLIED DECISION OF REJECTION .   THAT LINE OF ARGUMENT ON THE PART OF THE COMMISSION MUST BE REJECTED SINCE IT IS CONTRARY TO THE GOOD FAITH WHICH MUST PREVAIL IN RELATIONS BETWEEN THE COMMISSION AND ITS EMPLOYEES , INCLUDING THEIR RELATIONS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS . THE COMMISSION MAY NOT RELY ON THE FACT THAT IT FAILED TO REPLY TO A COMPLAINT WITHIN THE PERIOD LAID DOWN BY THE STAFF REGULATIONS . SINCE THE DECISION OF MAY AND THE EARLIER IMPLIED DECISION TO REJECT THE COMPLAINT WERE THE SAME IN SUBSTANCE , IT IS IRRELEVANT TO ESTABLISH WHICH OF THOSE DECISIONS THE APPLICATION FORMALLY CONTESTS IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE ADOPTION OF THE CONFIRMATORY MEASURE AND THE LODGING OF THE APPLICATION OCCURRED WITHIN THE LIMITATION PERIOD WHICH STARTED TO RUN FROM THE DATE OF THE IMPLIED DECISION REJECTING THE COMPLAINT .  SUBSTANCE   IN ORDER TO GIVE JUDGMENT ON THE CLAIMS SUBMITTED BY THE APPLICANT IT IS NECESSARY FIRST OF ALL TO CLARIFY THE SCOPE OF THE COURT ' S POWER TO REVIEW DECISIONS OF THE KIND UNDER CHALLENGE IN THE PRESENT PROCEEDINGS . THE SCOPE AND THE LIMITS OF THAT POWER OF REVIEW MUST BE DETERMINED ON THE BASIS OF THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY , THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS AND THE RULES .   ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY THE COURT HAS JURISDICTION IN ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND ITS SERVANTS ' ' WITHIN THE LIMITS AND UNDER THE CONDITIONS LAID DOWN IN THE STAFF REGULATIONS ' ' .       THE RULES DRAWN UP UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS ADOPT THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES WHICH MAY ARISE IN THE APPLICATION OF THE INSURANCE SCHEME AGAINST THE RISK OF ACCIDENT AND OF OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE :   ARTICLE ' ' DECISIONS RECOGNIZING THE ACCIDENTAL CAUSE OF AN OCCURRENCE INCLUDING A DECISION AS TO WHETHER THE OCCURRENCE IS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO OCCUPATIONAL OR NON-OCCUPATIONAL RISKS , OR DECISIONS RECOGNIZING THE OCCUPATIONAL NATURE OF A DISEASE AND ASSESSING THE DEGREE OF PERMANENT INVALIDITY SHALL BE TAKEN BY THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURE LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE ,   - ON THE BASIS OF THE FINDINGS OF THE DOCTOR(S ) APPOINTED BY THE INSTITUTIONS ; AND  - WHERE THE OFFICIAL SO REQUESTS , AFTER CONSULTING THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE . ' '   ARTICLE ' ' ( ) THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE SHALL CONSIST OF THREE DOCTORS :   - ONE APPOINTED BY THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY ;  - ONE APPOINTED BY THE OFFICIAL CONCERNED OR THOSE ENTITLED UNDER HIM ;  - ONE APPOINTED BY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FIRST TWO DOCTORS .  WHERE AGREEMENT CANNOT BE REACHED ON THE APPOINTMENT OF THE THIRD DOCTOR WITHIN A PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS FOLLOWING APPOINTMENT OF THE SECOND DOCTOR , THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES SHALL APPOINT THE THIRD DOCTOR AT THE REQUEST OF EITHER PARTY .  ON COMPLETING ITS PROCEEDINGS , THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE SHALL SET OUT ITS OPINION IN A REPORT TO BE COMMUNICATED TO THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY AND TO THE OFFICIAL OR THOSE ENTITLED UNDER HIM . ' '    THOSE PROVISIONS ARE INTENDED TO CONFER UPON MEDICAL EXPERTS THE TASK OF APPRAISING IN THEIR ENTIRETY MEDICAL QUESTIONS WHICH ARE RELEVANT TO THE OPERATION OF THE INSURANCE SCHEME SET UP BY THE RULES . UNDER THEM EACH OFFICIAL IS ENTITLED TO TWO EXAMINATIONS , THE FIRST BY THE DOCTOR OR DOCTORS OF     THE INSTITUTION AND THE SECOND , IN CASE OF DISAGREEMENT , BY A MEDICAL COMMITTEE COMPOSED IN SUCH A WAY THAT EACH OF THE PARTIES IS ENTITLED TO APPOINT A DOCTOR OF HIS CHOICE , WHILST THE IMPARTIALITY OF THE THIRD DOCTOR IS GUARANTEED BY THE REQUIREMENT THAT HE BE APPOINTED BY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FIRST TWO DOCTORS APPOINTED , OR , WHERE AGREEMENT CANNOT BE REACHED , BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE .   THE ORGANIZATION OF THAT COMPLAINTS PROCEDURE AND THE CARE WITH WHICH THE PROVISIONS QUOTED STRIVE TO ENSURE THE BALANCE AND OBJECTIVITY OF MEDICAL COMMITTEES ARE EVIDENCE OF A DESIRE TO SETTLE DEFINITIVELY AT THAT STAGE , IN CASE OF DISPUTE , ALL QUESTIONS OF A MEDICAL NATURE .   IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THE REMEDIES PROVIDED BY THE STAFF REGULATIONS MAY IN PRINCIPLE BE EMPLOYED ONLY IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A REVIEW BY THE COURT CONFINED TO QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE CONSTITUTION AND PROPER FUNCTIONING OF THE COMMITTEES PROVIDED FOR BY ARTICLES AND OF THE RULES . ON THE OTHER HAND , THE COURT ' S REVIEW MAY NOT EXTEND TO MEDICAL APPRAISALS PROPERLY SO CALLED WHICH MUST BE CONSIDERED DEFINITIVE , PROVIDED THAT THEY ARE ADOPTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CORRECT PROCEDURE .   IT IS IN THE LIGHT OF THESE PRINCIPLES THAT THE COMPLAINTS SUBMITTED BY THE APPLICANT MUST BE EXAMINED .   FIRST , THE APPLICANT SUBMITS VARIOUS COMPLAINTS CONCERNING THE CONSTITUTION OF THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE , THE QUALIFICATIONS OF ITS MEMBERS AND THE REALITY OF THE AGREEMENT REACHED WITHIN THAT COMMITTEE . IT IS ARGUED THAT THE THIRD MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE WAS IRREGULARLY CHOSEN SINCE HIS APPOINTMENT WAS SUGGESTED BY THE COMMISSION ' S DOCTOR TO THE DOCTOR APPOINTED BY THE APPLICANT WHO DID NOT AUTHORIZE THAT CHOICE OR APPROVE IT . THE APPLICANT FURTHER CALLS IN QUESTION THE QUALIFICATIONS BOTH OF THE DOCTOR APPOINTED BY THE COMMISSION AND OF THE THIRD DOCTOR , CONTRASTING THEM WITH THE HIGH QUALIFICATIONS OF THE VARIOUS SPECIALISTS WHICH HE HIMSELF CONSULTED AND WHOM HE CLASSIFIES AS ' ' EMINENT AUTHORITIES IN THE FIELD OF INJURIES TO THE BRAIN ' ' . FINALLY , HE CLAIMS THAT THE DOCTOR APPOINTED BY HIM WAS MISLED AND THAT HE SIGNED THE REPORT ' ' AGAINST HIS REAL PERSUASIONS ' ' .       THOSE ALLEGATIONS MUST BE DISMISSED AS UNFOUNDED IN FACT AND IN LAW .   IT IS NOT IN DISPUTE THAT THE APPLICANT DULY APPOINTED THE DOCTOR WHOM HE WAS ENTITLED TO APPOINT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES . HE WAS NOT REQUIRED TO TAKE ANY PART IN THE CHOICE OF THE DOCTOR APPOINTED BY THE COMMISSION AND THE CRITICISMS MADE BY HIM AS TO THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THAT DOCTOR MUST THUS BE DISMISSED AS ENTIRELY UNFOUNDED . WITH REGARD TO THE APPOINTMENT OF THE THIRD DOCTOR IT IS SUFFICIENT TO REFER TO ARTICLE OF THE RULES WHICH PROVIDES THAT THE THIRD DOCTOR IS TO BE APPOINTED ' ' BY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FIRST TWO DOCTORS ' ' . IT FOLLOWS FROM THIS THAT THE DOCTOR CHOSEN BY THE APPLICANT WAS NOT REQUIRED TO TAKE INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE APPLICANT OR SEEK HIS APPROVAL . THE FACT THAT THE NAME OF THE THIRD DOCTOR WAS SUGGESTED BY THE COMMISSION ' S DOCTOR IS A NORMAL PRACTICE IN THIS CONNEXION SINCE EITHER OF THE FIRST TWO DOCTORS IS FREE TO MAKE SUGGESTIONS AS TO THE CHOICE OF THE THIRD , THE SOLE REQUIREMENT OF THE RULES BEING THAT THE APPOINTMENT OF THAT THIRD DOCTOR SHOULD BE BY ' ' AGREEMENT ' '  BETWEEN THE FIRST TWO DOCTORS , AS UNDOUBTEDLY HAPPENED IN THIS CASE .   THE ALLEGATION THAT THE DOCTOR APPOINTED BY THE APPLICANT SIGNED THE REPORT ONLY AGAINST HIS REAL PERSUASIONS APPEARS TO BE BASED ON THE CONSIDERATION THAT IN A PREVIOUS REPORT DRAWN UP FOR THE PURPOSE OF AN ACTION FOR DAMAGES AGAINST THE LUXEMBOURG STATE HE HAD EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT THE APPLICANT ' S DEGREE OF INVALIDITY WAS HIGHER . THAT VIEW , WHICH WAS REACHED AT ANOTHER TIME AND IN A DIFFERENT CONTEXT , CANNOT IN ANY WAY BIND THAT DOCTOR WHO , ACCORDING TO THE DECLARATIONS MADE IN THE COURSE OF THE INQUIRY INTO THE CASE , ULTIMATELY CONCURRED IN THE OPINION OF THE OTHER TWO MEMBERS OF THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE . WHATEVER DOUBTS HE MAY HAVE ENTERTAINED , THE ADOPTION OF THE OPINION OF THE COMMITTEE , WHETHER UNANIMOUSLY OR BY A MAJORITY , CONSTITUTES A FINAL DECISION WHICH CANNOT BE CALLED IN QUESTION .   SECONDLY , THE APPLICANT CLAIMS THAT THE EXAMINATION PROCEDURE FOLLOWED BY THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE WAS INADEQUATE . IT HAD ONLY CARRIED OUT A ' ' SUMMARY EXAMINATION ' '  LASTING MINUTES WHICH BORE NO COMPARISON WITH THE  THOROUGH EXAMINATIONS WHICH HE UNDERWENT PRIVATELY ; CERTAIN PRELIMINARY     TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT BY ANCILLARY MEDICAL STAFF ; FINALLY , HE DOUBTS WHETHER ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WERE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE FINER POINTS OF THE MEDICAL REPORTS WHICH HE HAD PLACED ON HIS FILE AND WHICH WERE WRITTEN IN ITALIAN .   THOSE AFFIRMATIONS ARE NOT OF SUCH A NATURE AS TO CAST ANY DOUBT WHATEVER ON THE PROPER CONDUCT OF THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE ' S PROCEEDINGS . IT IS NORMAL MEDICAL PRACTICE FOR CERTAIN PRELIMINARY EXAMINATIONS TO BE CARRIED OUT BY ANCILLARY STAFF . FURTHERMORE , IT IS NOT CONTESTED THAT THE COMMITTEE HAD BEFORE IT THE WHOLE MEDICAL FILE WHICH INCLUDED THE RESULTS OF THE THOROUGH EXAMINATIONS CARRIED OUT AT AN EARLIER STAGE OF THE PROCEDURE BY THE COMMISSION ' S DOCTORS . FINALLY , THE COMMITTEE REMAINED ENTITLED TO DETERMINE THE NATURE AND LENGTH OF THE PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE APPLICANT . IT WAS ALSO FOR THE COMMITTEE TO ASSESS THE APPROPRIATENESS OF TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE MEDICAL REPORTS WHICH THE APPLICANT HIMSELF PLACED ON HIS FILE AND TO RESOLVE THE TRANSLATION PROBLEMS WHICH SUCH REPORTS MIGHT ENTAIL FOR ONE OR OTHER OF ITS MEMBERS .   FINALLY , THE APPLICANT CLAIMS THAT THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION ONLY THE ' ' OBJECTIVE ' '  ELEMENTS OF HIS INVALIDITY AND ENTIRELY DISREGARDED THE ' ' SUBJECTIVE ' '  EFFECTS OF THE ACCIDENT . THE RATE OF 3% IS SAID TO BE MANIFESTLY INSUFFICIENT TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE ' ' SERIOUS DETERIORATION IN THE MENTAL STATE ' '  OF THE APPLICANT AND OF ' ' HYPOCHONDRIA CAUSED BY THE ACCIDENT ' ' . ACCORDING TO THE APPLICANT , THE RATE OF 15% , AT WHICH PROFESSOR ZANALDA ARRIVED BY TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE SUBJECTIVE FACTOR , REPRESENTS A MORE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF COMPENSATION .   ON THIS QUESTION IT IS SUFFICIENT TO REMARK THAT , IN ASSESSING THE DEGREE OF INVALIDITY AT 3% , THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE EXPRESSLY STATED THAT IT ' ' HAD REGARD  TO THE GENERAL STATE OF HEALTH ' '  OF THE APPLICANT . IT IS THUS CLEAR THAT THE COMMITTEE CONSIDERED ALL ASPECTS OF THE CASE OF INVALIDITY IN QUESTION AND THAT IT DID NOT CONSIDER THAT THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL AFTER-EFFECTS OF THE ACCIDENT JUSTIFIED FINDING A DEGREE OF INVALIDITY IN EXCESS OF 3% . HAVING  REGARD TO THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS THAT APPRAISAL MUST BE CONSIDERED FINAL AND CONCLUSIVE .       WITH REGARD TO THE REQUEST THAT THE COURT SHOULD ORDER A NEW EXPERT OPINION TO BE OBTAINED , THAT CLAIM MUST BE DISMISSED AS EXCEEDING THE BOUNDS OF THE JUDICIAL REVIEW WHICH THE COURT IS ABLE TO PERFORM IN THIS CASE .   IT IS CLEAR FROM THE FOREGOING THAT THE CONCLUSIONS AND ARGUMENTS RELATING TO THE WORK OF THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE MUST BE DISMISSED IN THEIR ENTIRETY .  THE CLAIM FOR ADJUSTMENT OF THE COMPENSATION AWARDED   FINALLY , THE APPLICANT CLAIMS THAT THE LUMP SUM PAID BY THE COMMISSION SHOULD ATTRACT INTEREST AS FROM THE DATE OF THE ACCIDENT AND THAT IT SHOULD BE ADJUSTED BY SOME MEANS OR OTHER IN ORDER TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE FALL IN THE VALUE OF MONEY .   AS THE COMMISSION RIGHTLY STATES , THAT CLAIM IS BASED ON A CONFUSION BETWEEN REPARATION FOR LOSS IN THE CONTEXT OF AN ACTION FOR DAMAGES AND THE PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE IN THE CONTEXT OF ACCIDENT INSURANCE .   UNDER THE INSURANCE PROVIDED FOR BY THE STAFF REGULATIONS THE COMPENSATION PAYABLE IN THE EVENT OF INVALIDITY IS IN THE NATURE OF A FLAT-RATE AWARD ASSESSED ON THE BASIS OF THE LASTING EFFECTS OF AN ACCIDENT . INTEREST MAY THUS BE CLAIMED ONLY WHERE THE PERSON ENTITLED TO THAT AWARD IS ABLE TO ESTABLISH THAT PAYMENT THEREOF WAS IMPROPERLY DELAYED BY THE ADMINISTRATION .   IN THIS CASE IT IS CLEAR THAT THE COMMISSION OFFERED THE APPLICANT THE COMPENSATION PAYABLE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE INSURANCE POLICY AS SOON AS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO CONSIDER THAT HIS CONDITION HAD STABILIZED AND THAT THE APPROPRIATE EXAMINATIONS HAD BEEN CONCLUDED . IN CHALLENGING THAT DECISION THE APPLICANT TOOK UPON HIMSELF THE RISK OF DELAY INEVITABLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF SUCH A DISPUTE . HE MAY NOT CAST THE BLAME FOR THAT UPON THE COMMISSION .   IT IS THUS NECESSARY TO DISMISS THE CLAIM FOR INTEREST AND THE CLAIM FOR ADJUSTMENT OF THE COMPENSATION OFFERED BY THE COMMISSION .
