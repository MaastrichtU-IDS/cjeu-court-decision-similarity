Operative part
The Court:
1.
	Declares that, by failing to apply national conservation measures to all species of birds naturally occurring in the wild
                     state in the European territory of the Member States and entitled to protection under Directive 2009/147/EC of the European
                     Parliament and of the Council of November on the conservation of wild birds, and likewise by failing to define correctly
                     the conditions to be met in order to be able to derogate from the prohibitions laid down by that directive, the Republic of
                     Poland has failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles 1, and 9(1) and (2) of that directive; 
                  
2.
	Orders the Republic of Poland to pay the costs.
