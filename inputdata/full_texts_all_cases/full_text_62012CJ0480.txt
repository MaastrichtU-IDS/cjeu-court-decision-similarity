This request for a preliminary ruling concerns the interpretation of Articles and of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/of October establishing the Community Customs Code (OJ L 302, p. 1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 648/of the European Parliament and of the Council of April (OJ L 117, p. 13; ‘the Customs Code’), read in conjunction with Articles and 859(2)(c) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/of July laying down provisions for the implementation of Regulation No 2913/(OJ L 253, p. 1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 444/of March (OJ L 68, p. 11; ‘the Implementing Regulation’), and also the interpretation of Article of the Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of May on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes — Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment (OJ L 145, p. 1), as amended by Council Directive 2004/66/EC of April (OJ L 168, p. 35; ‘the Sixth Directive’).
The request has been made in proceedings between Minister van Financiën and X BV (‘X’), concerning that company’s application seeking reimbursement of the customs duties and turnover tax due on account of the period for presentation of the goods in question being exceeded.

2.   The customs debt shall be incurred either at the moment when the obligation whose non-fulfilment gives rise to the customs debt ceases to be met or at the moment when the goods are placed under the customs procedure concerned where it is established subsequently that a condition governing the placing of the goods under the said procedure or the granting of a reduced or zero rate of import duty by virtue of the end-use of the goods was not in fact fulfilled.

they do not imply obvious negligence on the part of the person concerned, and
—
all the formalities necessary to regularise the situation of the goods are subsequently carried out:
(1)
exceeding the time-limit allowed for assignment of the goods to one of the customs-approved treatments or uses provided for under the temporary storage or customs procedure in question, where the time-limit would have been extended had an extension been applied for in time;

Article of the Implementing Regulation provides:

…’
Article of the Implementing Regulation provides:
‘Without prejudice to the provisions laid down concerning prohibitions or restrictions which may be applicable to the goods in question, where a customs debt on importation is incurred pursuant to Articles 202, 203, or of the [Customs] Code and the import duties have been paid, those goods shall be deemed to be Community goods without the need for a declaration for entry into free circulation.’

Article of the Sixth Directive provided:
‘1.   “Importation of goods” shall mean:
(a)
the entry into the Community of goods which do not fulfil the conditions laid down in Articles [EC and EC] or, where the goods are covered by the Treaty establishing the [ECSC], are not in free circulation;
(b)
the entry into the Community of goods from a third territory, other than the goods covered by (a).

Similarly, when goods referred to in paragraph 1(b) are placed, on entry into the Community, under one of the procedures referred to in Article 33a(1)(b) or (c), the place of import shall be the Member State within whose territory this procedure ceases to apply.’
Article 10(3) of the Sixth Directive provided:
‘The chargeable event shall occur and the tax shall become chargeable when the goods are imported. Where goods are placed under one of the arrangements referred to in Article 7(3) on entry into the Community, the chargeable event shall occur and the tax shall become chargeable only when the goods cease to be covered by those arrangements.
…’
Article 16(1) of the Sixth Directive provided:
‘1.   Without prejudice to other Community provisions, Member States may, subject to the consultations provided for in Article 29, take special measures designed to relieve from [VAT] all or some of the following transactions, provided that they are not aimed at final use and/or consumption and that the amount of [VAT] charged at entry for home use corresponds to the amount of the tax which should have been charged had each of these transactions been taxed on import or within the territory of the country
A.
imports of goods which are intended to be placed under warehousing arrangements other than customs;
B.

Netherlands law
Article of the Law replacing turnover tax by the system of taxing added value (Wet houdende vervanging van de bestaande omzetbelasting door een omzetbelasting volgens het stelsel van heffing over de toegevoegde waarde), of June 1968, provides:
‘A tax called “turnover tax” shall be levied on:
…
(d)
the importation of goods.’
Article of that law provides:
‘1.   “Importation of goods” means:
(a)
the entry into the Netherlands of goods which do not meet the conditions set out at Articles [EC] and 24[EC];
(b)
the entry into the Netherlands of goods coming from a third country, other than those referred to in subparagraph (a);
(c)
the end of a customs procedure in the Netherlands or the removal of goods from a customs procedure in the Netherlands;
…
2.   For the purposes of the application of this article, “customs procedure” means:
(a)
the temporary storage within the meaning of Article of the Customs Code …;
...
(c)
the customs procedure within the meaning of Article 4(16)(b),(c),(d),(e), and, in the case of total exemption from import duty, (f) of the Customs Code …
3.   The entry into the Netherlands of goods within the meaning of Paragraph 1(a) and (b), to which a customs procedure applies or which, after entry into the Netherlands, are placed under a customs procedure does not constitute importation. The end of a customs procedure, in the Netherlands, is not considered to be equivalent to an importation where it is followed by the application of another customs procedure.’
The dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling
On October 2005, X made an electronic application for a diesel engine to be placed under the external Community transit procedure. The deadline by which that engine should have been presented at the office of destination was set at October 2005.
That engine was presented to that office only on November 2005, that is to say, days after expiry of the time-limit prescribed, and was placed under the inward processing customs procedure with the application of the drawback system. The customs office in question, after accepting that application, found that the previous customs procedure, namely, the external Community transit procedure, had not been properly terminated and invalidated that placement.
After apprising X of that situation, the inspector responsible (‘the inspector’) gave X the opportunity to provide proof that it had completed the customs procedure properly, proof which it could not provide. The inspector therefore concluded that the engine at issue in the main proceedings had been removed from customs supervision, within the meaning of Article 203(1) of the Customs Code. On that basis, it requested that X pay customs duties and turnover tax.
X brought an action before the Rechtbank te Haarlem (District Court, Haarlem), which granted the action and ordered the inspector to repay the amount of customs duties and turnover tax which X had paid. The inspector brought an appeal against that decision before the Gerechtshof te Amsterdam (Regional Court of Appeal, Amsterdam), which upheld the Rechtbank te Haarlem’s decision.
The Minister van Financiën (Minister for Finance) brought an appeal on a point of law before the Hoge Raad der Nederlanden (Supreme Court of the Netherlands).
The Hoge Raad der Nederlanden asks what legal consequences should be drawn from the time-limit laid down on the basis Article 356(1) of the Implementing Regulation being exceeded. In particular, according to that court, the question arises whether the failure to respect that time-limit should automatically be regarded as amounting to removal from customs supervision within the meaning of Article 203(1) of the Customs Code, resulting in customs dues being due, or if is it then a question of non-fulfilment of one of the obligations arising from the use of the customs procedure in question, in which case the levy of those duties should be waived if it is established that it is a failure with no significant effect on the correct operation of the customs procedure within the meaning of the final sentence of Article 204(1) of the Customs Code, read in conjunction with Article of the Implementing Regulation. In addition, the referring court considers that if it is decided that a customs debt was incurred on the basis of Article 204(1) of the Customs Code, the question then arises whether turnover tax is due in addition to customs duties.
It was on that basis that the Hoge Raad der Nederlanden decided to stay proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:
‘(1)
(a)
Must Articles and of the Customs Code, read in conjunction with Article (in particular Article 859(2)(c)) of the Implementing Regulation, be interpreted as meaning that (merely) exceeding the transportation time-limit set under Article 356(1) of the Implementing Regulation does not lead to a customs debt being incurred by reason of a removal from customs supervision within the meaning of Article of the Customs Code, but to a customs debt being incurred on the basis of Article of the Customs Code?
(b)
For Question 1(a) to be answered in the affirmative, is it necessary that the persons concerned supply the customs authorities with information on the reasons for which the time-limit was exceeded or that they at least explain to the customs authorities where the goods were held during the time which elapsed between the time-limit set under Article of the Implementing Regulation and the time at which they were actually presented at the customs office of destination?
(2)
Must the Sixth Directive, in particular Article of that directive, be interpreted as meaning that VAT is due when a customs debt is incurred exclusively on the basis of Article of the Customs Code?’
The questions referred for a preliminary ruling
The first question
By its first question the referring court asks, in essence, whether the presentation of goods at the office of destination, after the time allowed has elapsed, gives rise to a customs debt pursuant to either Article or Article of the Customs Code. The court also asks whether, in order that a customs debt might be incurred under Article of the Customs Code, the interested parties must supply information on the reasons for exceeding the time-limit set under Article 356(1) of the Implementing Regulation or on the location of the goods during the period concerned.
For the purposes of answering the first question, reformulated accordingly, it should be noted at the outset that Articles and of the Customs Code have different spheres of application. Whilst the first provision covers conduct leading to the goods being removed from customs supervision, the second covers failure to fulfil obligations and non-compliance with the conditions of the various customs schemes which have no effect on customs supervision (Case C‑337/Hamann International
EU:C:2004:90, paragraph 28).
It is clear from the wording of Article of the Customs Code that it applies only to situations which do not fall within the scope of Article of the same code (Hamann International
EU:C:2004:90, paragraph 29).
It follows that, in order to determine which of those two articles forms the basis on which a customs debt on importation is incurred, it is necessary, first of all, to consider whether in the factual situation in question there was an unlawful removal from customs supervision within the meaning of Article 203(1) of the Customs Code. Only if that question has been answered in the negative is it possible that Article of the Customs Code may apply (Hamann International
EU:C:2004:90, paragraph 30).
As regards, more specifically, the concept of unlawful removal from customs supervision, referred to in Article 203(1) of the Customs Code, it should be borne in mind that, in accordance with the Court’s case-law, that concept must be interpreted as covering any act or omission the result of which is to prevent, if only for a short time, the competent customs authority from gaining access to goods under customs supervision and from carrying out the monitoring required by Article 37(1) of the Customs Code (Case C‑66/D. Wandel
EU:C:2001:69, paragraph 47; Case C‑371/Liberexim
EU:C:2002:433, paragraph 55; and Hamann International
EU:C:2004:90, paragraph 31).
In the light of that interpretation, it is clear that, as the Advocate General observed at points and of his Opinion, even though the location of the goods at issue in the main proceedings remained unknown for more than two weeks, which may mean that the inability to give access to those goods is more than merely temporary, nonetheless, according to case-law, the application of Article of the Customs Code is justified where the disappearance of the goods entailed a risk of entry into the economic networks of the European Union (see, to that effect, Liberexim
EU:C:2002:433, paragraph 56, and Case C‑300/Honeywell Aerospace
EU:C:2005:43, paragraph 20).
The presence, on the customs territory of the European Union, of non-Community goods carries the risk that those goods will end up forming part of the economic networks of the Member States without having been cleared through customs, a risk which Article of the Customs Code contributes to preventing (see, by analogy, Case C‑234/DSV Road
EU:C:2010:435, paragraph 31).
As is clear from the order for reference, the goods in question were indeed presented to the office of destination days late. Therefore, it is undisputed that those goods have not entered the economic networks without having been cleared through customs. It follows that, subject to verification by the referring court, it seems inconceivable that Article of the Customs Code could apply to the facts at issue in the main proceedings.
In those circumstances, it must be, therefore, determined if the facts in the main proceedings could fall within Article 204(1)(a) of the Customs Code.
Under Article 204(1)(a) of the Customs Code, a customs debt on importation is incurred through non-fulfilment of one of the obligations arising, in respect of goods liable to import duties, from the use of the customs procedure under which they are placed, unless it is established that the failure has no significant effect on the correct operation of the procedure in question. Any circumstance not covered by this exception falls within the sphere of application of Article of the Customs Code (see Case C‑262/Döhler Neuenkirchen
EU:C:2012:559, paragraph 35).
It should be borne in mind that Article of the Implementing Regulation, read in conjunction with Article thereof, establishes a procedure which provides for an exhaustive list of failures, within the meaning of Article 204(1)(a) of the Customs Code, which ‘shall be considered to have no significant effect on the correct operation of the temporary storage or customs procedure in question’.
It must also be pointed out that Article 859(2)(c) of the Implementing Regulation expressly provides that, where the time-limit set under Article thereof has not been complied with and the belated presentation of the goods at the office of destination cannot be justified under Article 356(3) thereof, exceeding the time‑limit for presenting [the goods] is considered as having no significant effect on the correct operation of the temporary storage or customs procedure in question, where the goods were nevertheless presented to the office of destination within a reasonable time. In that respect, it is for the referring court to assess the explanation provided when applying Articles 356(3) and 859(2)(c) of the Implementing Regulation.
In addition, as the Advocate General observed at point of his Opinion, since exceeding the time-limit is expressly provided for in Article of the Implementing Regulation, which does not apply to the cases referred to in Article of the Customs Code, that provision would be ineffective if exceeding that time-limit had to be caught by the concept of ‘removal’, referred to in Article of Customs Code.
As to whether, in order that a customs debt may be incurred under Article of the Customs Code, the interested parties must supply information on the reasons for exceeding the time-limit set under Article 356(1) of the Implementing Regulation or on the location of the goods during the period concerned, Article 356(3) of the Implementing Regulation clearly provides that, where the goods are produced at the office of destination after expiry of the time-limit prescribed by the office of departure and where this failure to comply with the time-limit is due to circumstances which are explained to the satisfaction of the office of destination and which are beyond the control of the carrier or the principal, the latter is deemed to have complied with the time-limit prescribed.
Accordingly, the information which has to be provided by the interested parties on the reasons for exceeding the time-limit or on the location of the goods in question during the period in question is intended to avoid a customs debt being incurred under Article of the Customs Code and does not in any way result in that article being triggered.
In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the first question is that Articles and of the Customs Code, read in conjunction with Article 859(2)(c) of the Implementing Regulation, must be interpreted as meaning that merely exceeding the time‑limit for presentation, set under Article 356(1) of the Implementing Regulation, does not lead to a customs debt being incurred for removal from customs supervision of the goods in question within the meaning of Article of the Customs Code, but to a customs debt being incurred on the basis of Article of the Customs Code and that it is not necessary, for a customs debt to be incurred under Article thereof, that the interested parties supply to the customs authorities information on the reasons for exceeding the time-limit set under Article of the Implementing Regulation or on the location of the goods in question during the time which elapsed between that time‑limit and the time at which they were actually presented at the customs office of destination.
The second question
By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article of the Sixth Directive must be interpreted as meaning that VAT is due where a customs debt is incurred exclusively on the basis of Article of the Customs Code.
As a preliminary point, it should be remembered that, under Article of the Sixth Directive, the importation of goods and the supplies of goods or services effected for consideration within the territory of the country by a taxable person acting as such are subject to VAT.
It needs to be verified, first, whether goods such as those at issue in the main proceedings have been subject to importation within the meaning of Article 2(2) of the Sixth Directive (Case C‑165/Profitube
EU:C:2012:692, paragraph 41).
According to Article 7(1)(a) of the Sixth Directive, ‘importation of goods’ means the entry into the Community of goods which do not fulfil the conditions laid down in Articles EC and EC.
Moreover Article 7(3) of the Sixth Directive provides that, where such goods are, on entry into the Community, placed under one of the arrangements referred to in Article 16(1)(B)(a),(b),(c) and (d) of that directive, or under the external transit procedure, the place of their import is the Member State within the territory of which they cease to be covered by those arrangements.
Furthermore, it follows from Article of the Implementing Regulation that, where a customs debt on importation is incurred pursuant to, inter alia, Articles or of the Customs Code and the import duties have been paid, those goods are to be deemed to be Community goods without the need for a declaration for entry into free circulation.
In the present case, it will, therefore, be a matter for the referring court to ascertain, taking into account the points raised at paragraph above, whether or not the goods at issue in the main proceedings have ceased to be covered by the external transit procedure, giving rise, as the case may be, to customs debt pursuant to Articles or of the Customs Code.
Were the referring court to reach the conclusion that, in respect of those goods, no customs debt is incurred pursuant to those provisions, it must be considered that those goods have been placed, on entry into the European Union, under the arrangements referred to in Article 7(3) and Article 16(1)(B)(a) of the Sixth Directive. In that case, VAT would not, consequently, be due.
However, those goods have already ceased to be covered by those arrangements on the date of their re-exportation on account of a customs debt being incurred, which it is for the referring court to determine, it must be considered as having been the subject of an ‘importation’ within the meaning of Article 2(2) of the Sixth Directive.
In light of the foregoing, the answer to the second question is that the first paragraph of Article 7(3) of the Sixth Directive must be interpreted as meaning that VAT is due where the goods in question are not covered by the arrangements provided for in that article, even where a customs debt is incurred exclusively on the basis of Article of the Customs Code.
Costs
Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.
 
On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules:
 
1.
Articles and of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/of October establishing the Community Customs Code, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 648/of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 2005, read in conjunction with Article 859(2)(c) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/of July laying down provisions for the implementation of Regulation No 2913/92, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 444/of March must be interpreted as meaning that merely exceeding the time-limit for presentation, set under Article 356(1) of Regulation No 2454/93, as amended by Regulation No 444/2002, does not lead to a customs debt being incurred for removal from customs supervision of the goods in question within the meaning of Article of Regulation No 2913/92, as amended by Regulation No 648/2005, but to a customs debt being incurred on the basis of Article of that regulation and that it is not necessary, for a customs debt to be incurred under Article of that regulation, that the interested parties supply to the customs authorities information on the reasons for exceeding the time‑limit set under Article of Regulation No 2454/93, as amended by Article No 444/2002, or on the location of the goods during the time which elapsed between that time‑limit and the time at which they were actually presented at the customs office of destination.
 
2.
The first paragraph of Article 7(3) of the Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of May on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes — Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment, as amended by Council Directive 2004/66/EC of April must be interpreted as meaning that value added tax is due where the goods in question are not covered by the arrangements provided for in that article, even where a customs debt is incurred exclusively on the basis of Article of Regulation No 2913/92, as amended by Regulation No 648/2005.
