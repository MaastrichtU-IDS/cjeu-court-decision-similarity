Summary
 $$National legislation which provides for different departure taxes to be paid by aircraft passengers according to whether their flight is domestic or intra-Community must be regarded as a restriction on the freedom to provide services and is prohibited under the combined provisions of Article of the Treaty (now, after amendment, Article EC) and Article 3(1) of Regulation No 2408/on access for Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes, a regulation which defines the conditions for applying in the air transport sector the principle of the freedom to provide services. The freedom enshrined in Article of the Treaty precludes the application of any national legislation which has the effect of making the provision of services between Member States more difficult than the provision of services purely within one Member State.( see paras 11-12, )

Grounds
By application lodged at the Court Registry on November 1999, the Commission of the European Communities brought an application under Article EC for a declaration that, by maintaining in force Article of the Decreto Ministeriale (Ministerial Decree) of August (Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica Italiana No of October 1998), which brings into force Law No of December 1993, as amended by Law No of December 1996, and which provides for different departure taxes according to whether the flight in question is domestic or intra-Community, the Italian Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under the combined provisions of Article of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article EC) and Article 3(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2408/of July on access for Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes (OJ L 240, p. 8).Relevant legislationThe Community legislationIt is apparent from the first and second recitals in the preamble to Regulation No 2408/that its purpose is to lay down, in accordance with Article 8a of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article EC), an air transport policy with a view to the progressive establishment of the internal market, which comprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured.Article 3(1) of Regulation No 2408/provides that:subject to [the] regulation, Community air carriers shall be permitted by the Member State(s) concerned to exercise traffic rights on routes within the Community.The national legislationArticle of the Italian Law No of May (GURI No of May 1976) provides that, on departure, passengers travelling by air are charged a diritto per l'imbarco passeggeri or departure tax, the amount of which varies according to whether the flight in question is international or domestic. That Law was subsequently amended by Law No of October (GURI No of October 1991), Law No of December (GURI, Ordinary Supplement No of December 1993) and Law No of December (GURI, Ordinary Supplement No of December 1996), all of which retained the system of different departure taxes for the two categories of passengers.Article of the Decreto Ministeriale of August altered the amount of the departure tax in the following manner:The departure tax for passengers on international flights, provided for by Article of Law No of May 1976, as amended, is hereby increased from ITL to ITL 500.The departure tax for passengers on domestic flights, provided for by Article of Law No of October 1991, is hereby increased from ITL to ITL 000.The precontentious procedureBy letter of formal notice of December 1996, the Commission informed the Italian Republic that the distinction made by Article of Law No of May 1976, as amended, between the departure tax for passengers travelling between Italy and other Member States and that for passengers on domestic Italian flights was incompatible with the principle of the freedom to provide services enshrined in Articles and of the EC Treaty (the latter article was repealed by the Treaty of Amsterdam), with Regulation No 2408/and with the freedom granted by Article 8a of the Treaty to every citizen of the Union to move within the territory of the Member States.On December 1998, following an exchange of correspondence with the Italian Republic, the Commission issued a reasoned opinion in which it called upon Italy to take the measures necessary to comply with the opinion within two months of its notification. The Italian Republic failed to respond to that opinion, whereupon the Commission brought the present action.Arguments of the partiesThe Commission submits that the Italian legislation establishing the departure taxes infringes Article 3(1) of Regulation No 2408/92, which must be interpreted in accordance with the general principle of freedom to provide services laid down in Article of the Treaty.In this connection, the Commission observes that the freedom to provide air transport services within the Community was created when the Council adopted, on July 1992, the third parcel of liberalisation measures, which came into effect on January 1993. Regulation No 2408/is a fundamental part of that parcel of measures, governing all matters relating to access to the air transport market and thus putting into effect the principles laid down in Article of the Treaty.The Italian Government does not dispute the Commission's complaint, but states that new national provisions are being prepared and that they will remove the distinction between intra-Community and domestic flights in so far as concerns departure tax, thus removing the grounds for complaint.Findings of the CourtIt must observed at the outset that, as the Court held at paragraph of its judgment in Case C-361/Italy v Commission [2001] ECR I-385, the purpose of Regulation No 2408/is, amongst other things, to define the conditions for applying in the air transport sector the principle of the freedom to provide services which is enshrined, in particular, in Articles and (now Article EC) of the EC Treaty, so that all matters of market access are dealt with in the same regulation.Next, it must be borne in mind that the freedom enshrined in Article precludes the application of any national legislation which has the effect of making the provision of services between Member States more difficult than the provision of services purely within one Member State (Case C-381/Commission v France [1994] ECR I-5145, paragraph 17).Lastly, it must be remembered that, according to settled case-law, the question whether a Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations must be determined by reference to the situation prevailing in the Member State at the end of the period laid down in the reasoned opinion (see, in particular, Case C-147/Commission v France [2001] ECR I-2387, paragraph 26).In the present case, it is common ground that the Italian Republic has not adopted the measures needed in order to comply with the reasoned opinion within the period allowed for the purpose.In view of all the foregoing, the Court finds that, by maintaining in force Article of the Decreto Ministeriale of August 1998, which provides for different departure taxes according to whether the flight in question is domestic or intra-Community, the Italian Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under the combined provisions of Article of the Treaty and Article 3(1) of Regulation No 2408/92. 
Decision on costs
CostsUnder Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party's pleadings. Since the Commission has applied for costs and the Italian Republic has been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to pay the costs. 
Operative part
On those grounds,THE COURT (Second Chamber)hereby:1. Declares that, by maintaining in force Article of the Decreto Ministeriale of August 1998, which brings into force Law No of December 1993, as amended by Law No of December 1996, and which provides for different departure taxes according to whether the flight in question is domestic or intra-Community, the Italian Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article EC) and Article 3(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2408/of July on access for Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes;2. Orders the Italian Republic to pay the costs.
