Summary
. THE DETERMINATION OF AN APPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECOND SENTENCE OF ARTICLE 2A ( ) OF REGULATION NO 986/BETWEEN THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND THE AID FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER FOR USE AS ANIMAL FEED DEPENDS UPON A COMPLEX ASSESSMENT WHICH PRECLUDES THE APPLICATION OF THE CRITERION MENTIONED IN ARTICLE ( 1)(D ) OF THAT REGULATION ,     WHICH RESTS ON OBSERVANCE OF A FIXED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AIDS IN QUESTION . ON THE CONTRARY , IT IMPLIES THAT THE COMMUNITY AUTHORITIES ENJOY A MARGIN OF DISCRETION IN THE MATTER WHICH PERMITS THEM TO LAY DOWN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND THE AID FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER HAVING REGARD TO ALL THE MARKET INFORMATION LISTED IN ARTICLE 2A ( ) AND TO ADJUST THAT RELATIONSHIP IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET TO WHICH THE PRODUCTS INVOLVED ARE SUBJECT .  . WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE DETERMINATION OF AN ' ' APPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP ' '  WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECOND SENTENCE OF ARTICLE 2A ( ) OF REGULATION NO 986/BETWEEN THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND SKIMMED-MILK POWDER FOR USE AS ANIMAL FEED , THE REASONS WHICH ARE SUCH AS TO JUSTIFY THE SIZE OF THE GAP TO BE CREATED BETWEEN THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND THE AID FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER MAY NOT BE BASED ON THE PARTICULAR POSITION OF CERTAIN UNDERTAKINGS OR GROUPS OF UNDERTAKINGS CONCERNED BUT MUST STEM FROM THE SECTOR CONCERNED AS A WHOLE AND FROM A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE RELATIONSHIPS SUBSISTING IN THE COMMON MARKET BETWEEN THE ONE PRODUCT AND THE OTHER .  . ARTICLE ( 1)(A ) OF REGULATION NO 986/DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT A MAXIMUM PRICE MUST ALWAYS BE FIXED FOR SKIMMED MILK SOLD BY DAIRIES TO FARMS WHICH USE IT AS FEED WHENEVER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND SKIMMED-MILK POWDER IS FIXED IN SUCH A MANNER THAT SKIMMED MILK BENEFITS FROM A RELATIVELY LARGER AID THAN THAT GRANTED FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER . THE FACT THAT COMMISSION REGULATION NO 1049/DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR THE FIXING OF SUCH A PRICE DOES NOT THEREFORE AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF THAT REGULATION .  . THE STATEMENT OF THE REASONS UPON WHICH A REGULATION IS BASED MUST BE REGARDED AND ASSESSED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE BODY OF LEGISLATION OF WHICH THAT MEASURE FORMS AN INTEGRAL PART . THEREFORE , THE REQUIREMENTS OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY ARE SATISFIED IF AN IMPLEMENTING REGULATION CONTAINS AN EXPLICIT REFERENCE TO PROVISIONS OF THE BASIC REGULATION AND THUS ALLOWS RECOGNITION OF THE CRITERIA WHICH WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN THE REGULATION WAS ADOPTED .

Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF REGULATION NO 986/OF THE COUNCIL OF JULY AND THE VALIDITY OF ARTICLE OF COMMISSION REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1049/OF MAY , 
Grounds
BY JUDGMENT OF JANUARY , WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON JANUARY , THE COLLEGE VAN BEROEP VOOR HET BEDRIJFSLEVEN SUBMITTED TO THE COURT , PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY , SEVERAL QUESTIONS ON THE INTERPRETATION OF REGULATION NO 986/OF THE COUNCIL OF JULY LAYING DOWN GENERAL RULES FOR GRANTING AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND SKIMMED-MILK POWDER FOR USE AS FEED ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ) AND ON THE VALIDITY OF COMMISSION REGULATION NO 1049/OF MAY FIXING , FOR THE 1978/MILK YEAR , THE AMOUNT OF THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND SKIMMED-MILK POWDER FOR USE AS FEED ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ).   THOSE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THE CONTEXT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN A MANUFACTURER OF COMPOUND ANIMAL FEEDINGSTUFFS AND THE PRODUKTSCHAP VOOR ZUIVEL , WHICH IS THE NATIONAL INTERVENTION BODY IN THE NETHERLANDS ENTRUSTED WITH IMPLEMENTING THE COMMUNITY SYSTEM OF AIDS FOR MILK . THE DISPUTE IS CONCERNED WITH THE AMOUNT OF THE AID FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER GRANTED TO THE SAID MANUFACTURER BY THAT BODY IN RESPECT OF THE QUANTITY OF THAT PRODUCT USED BETWEEN AND DECEMBER .        THE NATIONAL PROVISIONS APPLIED IN THE PRESENT CASE BY THE PRODUKTSCHAP VOOR ZUIVEL ARE BASED ON COMMISSION REGULATION NO 1049/OF MAY FIXING THE AMOUNT OF THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND SKIMMED-MILK POWDER FOR USE AS FEED . ARTICLE OF THAT REGULATION FIXED THE AMOUNT OF AID TO BE APPLIED AS FROM MAY AT UNITS OF ACCOUNT PER KILOGRAMS FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER AND 4.UNITS OF ACCOUNT PER KILOGRAMS FOR SKIMMED MILK . THE POWER TO FIX THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER WAS IN FACT CONFERRED UPON THE COMMISSION BY REGULATION NO 662/OF THE COUNCIL OF MARCH ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) WHICH EXTENDED TO THE FIXING OF THESE AIDS THE PROCEDURE KNOWN AS THE ' ' MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE PROCEDURE ' '  PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ).   THE AFOREMENTIONED MANUFACTURER APPEALED AGAINST THE DECISION OF THE PRODUKTSCHAP VOOR ZUIVEL AWARDING IT THE SAID AID ON THE GROUND , IN PARTICULAR , THAT THAT DECISION WAS BASED UPON A REGULATION WHICH CONTRAVENED REGULATION NO 986/OF THE COUNCIL BY PROVIDING FOR A HIGHER LEVEL OF AID FOR LIQUID SKIMMED MILK THAN FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER , LACKED AN ADEQUATE STATEMENT OF THE REASONS UPON WHICH IT WAS BASED AND ENTAILED DISCRIMINATION IN BREACH OF THE TREATY .   IT IS IN ORDER TO DECIDE THIS ISSUE RELATING TO THE VALIDITY OF COMMISSION REGULATION NO 1049/THAT THE NATIONAL COURT BEFORE WHICH THE APPEAL WAS BROUGHT HAS SUBMITTED TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE IN THE PRESENT REFERENCE QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE INTERPRETATION OF REGULATION NO 986/OF THE COUNCIL .  FIRST QUESTION   IN ITS FIRST QUESTION THE NATIONAL COURT ASKS THE COURT OF JUSTICE WHETHER THE WORDS ' ' APPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP ' ' , WHICH OCCUR IN THE SECOND SENTENCE OF ARTICLE 2A ( ) OF REGULATION NO 986/, REQUIRE THAT THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND THE AID FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER MUST IN EVERY CASE BE FIXED ACCORDING TO THE CRITERION WHICH IS SET FORTH IN ARTICLE ( 1)(D ) OF THAT REGULATION AND WHICH IS BASED ON OBSERVANCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP WHICH EXISTS BETWEEN ONE KILOGRAM OF SKIMMED-MILK POWDER AND THE NUMBER OF KILOGRAMS OF SKIMMED MILK FROM WHICH THE SAID QUANTITY OF SKIMMED-MILK POWDER MAY BE OBTAINED . THAT RELATIONSHIP IS APPROXIMATELY 10.KILOGRAMS OF SKIMMED MILK TO EACH KILOGRAM OF SKIMMED-MILK POWDER . IN PUTTING THAT     QUESTION , THE NATIONAL COURT SEEKS TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER , BECAUSE IT FIXES FOR SKIMMED MILK AN AMOUNT OF AID WHICH DOES NOT RESPECT THE ABOVE-MENTIONED CRITERION BUT IS EQUIVALENT TO A RELATIONSHIP OF 9.KILOGRAMS OF SKIMMED MILK PER KILOGRAM OF SKIMMED-MILK POWDER AND THEREBY CONFERS ON SKIMMED MILK AN ADVANTAGE OVER SKIMMED-MILK POWDER , COMMISSION REGULATION NO 1049/IS CONTRARY TO ARTICLE ( 1)(D ) AND THE SECOND SENTENCE OF ARTICLE 2A ( ) OF REGULATION NO 986/OF THE COUNCIL .   IN EFFECT , THE ISSUE WHICH THE COURT IS THUS CALLED UPON TO DECIDE IS WHETHER THE ' ' APPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP ' '  BETWEEN THE AID FOR LIQUID SKIMMED MILK AND THE AID FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER WHICH IS STIPULATED FOR BY THE SECOND SENTENCE OF ARTICLE 2A ( ) OF REGULATION NO 986/IS QUITE SIMPLY THE FIXED RELATIONSHIP LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE ( 1)(D ) OF THE SAME REGULATION .   ARTICLE ( ) PROVIDES THAT :    ' ' . AID MAY BE GRANTED FOR :    ( A ) SKIMMED MILK PRODUCED AND PROCESSED IN A DAIRY , DIFFERENTIATED FROM OTHER SKIMMED MILK IN A MANNER TO BE SPECIFIED AND SOLD TO FARMS WHERE IT IS USED AS FEED AT A PRICE NOT EXCEEDING ANY MAXIMUM PRICE WHICH MAY BE FIXED ;   ( B ) SKIMMED MILK WHICH HAS BEEN USED AS FEED ON THE FARMS WHERE IT WAS PRODUCED ;   ( C ) SKIMMED-MILK POWDER WHICH HAS BEEN DENATURED ACCORDING TO METHODS TO BE DETERMINED ;   ( D ) SKIMMED-MILK POWDER AND SKIMMED MILK PRODUCED AND PROCESSED IN THE DAIRY AND USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS . THE AID FOR A GIVEN QUANTITY OF SKIMMED MILK USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS SHALL BE EQUAL TO THE AID WHICH WOULD BE GRANTED FOR THE QUANTITY OF SKIMMED-MILK POWDER WHICH CAN BE OBTAINED FROM THAT QUANTITY OF SKIMMED MILK . ' '   THIS PROVISIONS DRAWS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN TWO CATEGORIES OF SKIMMED MILK : ON THE ONE HAND , MILK FALLING UNDER SUBPARAGRAPHS ( A ), ( B ) AND ( C ), WHICH IS     USED DIRECTLY ' ' AS FEED ' '  AND , ON THE OTHER HAND , THE SPECIFIC PRODUCTS FALLING UNDER SUBPARAGRAPH ( D ), NAMELY MILK USED ' ' IN THE MANUFACTURE OF COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS ' ' .   IT IS ONLY IN SUBPARAGRAPH ( D ) THAT ARTICLE ( ) ADOPTS THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND THE AID FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER MUST BE FIXED IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO RESPECT THE RELATIONSHIP WHICH EXISTS BETWEEN A GIVEN QUANTITY OF SKIMMED MILK AND THE QUANTITY OF SKIMMED-MILK POWDER WHICH CAN BE OBTAINED FROM IT . THAT FORM OF DRAFTING SHOWS CLEARLY THAT THE APPLICATION OF THAT PRINCIPLE DOES NOT EXTEND TO ALL CATEGORIES OF SKIMMED MILK BUT APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY AS REGARDS THE PRODUCTS EXPRESSLY MENTIONED IN SUBPARAGRAPH ( D ), THAT IS TO SAY MILK ' ' PRODUCED AND PROCESSED IN THE DAIRY AND USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS ' ' . IT IS IN FACT INDISPUTABLE THAT , AT THAT STAGE OF UTILIZATION , LIQUID SKIMMED MILK AND SKIMMED-MILK POWDER MUST BE REGARDED AS COMPARABLE PRODUCTS .   ACCORDINGLY , IT IS ONLY AS RESPECTS SKIMMED MILK PRODUCED AND PROCESSED IN A DAIRY AND USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS THAT THE PRODUCER OF SKIMMED-MILK POWDER INTENDED FOR THE SAME PURPOSE MAY , BY VIRTUE OF THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ( 1)(D ) OF THE SAID REGULATION , CLAIM THAT THE AID FOR EACH OF THE PRODUCTS SHOULD BE LAID DOWN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIXED RELATIONSHIP INDICATED BY THOSE PROVISIONS .   SO FAR AS THE PRODUCTS REFERRED TO IN SUBPARAGRAPHS ( A ), ( B ) AND ( C ) OF ARTICLE ( ) ARE CONCERNED , THE CRITERIA WHICH MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN FIXING THE AMOUNT OF THE AID CANNOT THEREFORE BE DERIVED FROM SUBPARAGRAPH ( D ) OF THAT ARTICLE . THOSE CRITERIA ARE SUPPLIED BY ARTICLE 2A OF REGULATION NO 986/OF THE COUNCIL , AS AMENDED BY REGULATION NO 666/OF THE COUNCIL , WHICH REQUIRES THAT THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK BEAR AN ' ' APPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP ' '  TO THE AID FIXED FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER .   THE AFOREMENTIONED ARTICLE 2A LISTS , IN PARAGRAPH ( ) THEREOF , THE FACTORS WHICH MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE CREATION OF SUCH A RELATIONSHIP . IT APPEARS FROM THAT LIST THAT THE DETERMINATION OF AN ' ' APPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP ' '  BETWEEN THE AIDS FOR THOSE PRODUCTS DEPENDS UPON A COMPLEX ASSESSMENT TOUCHING SIMULTANEOUSLY ON THE MARKET SITUATION , TRENDS IN PRICES , THE SUPPLY SITUATION AS REGARDS SKIMMED MILK AND SKIMMED-MILK POWDER AND THE USE OF THOSE PRODUCTS FOR ANIMAL FEED .       THAT ASSESSMENT PRECLUDES THE APPLICATION OF THE CRITERION MENTIONED IN ARTICLE ( ) ( D ) OF THE SAID REGULATION , WHICH RESTS ON OBSERVANCE OF A FIXED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AIDS IN QUESTION . ON THE CONTRARY , IT IMPLIES THAT THE COMMUNITY AUTHORITIES ENJOY A MARGIN OF DISCRETION IN THE MATTER WHICH PERMITS THEM TO LAY DOWN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND THE AID FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER HAVING REGARD TO ALL THE MARKET INFORMATION LISTED IN ARTICLE 2A ( ) AND TO ADJUST THAT RELATIONSHIP IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET TO WHICH THE PRODUCTS INVOLVED ARE SUBJECT .   COMMISSION REGULATION NO 1049/IS PRECISELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THOSE RULES . IN FACT , THE FIRST RECITAL IN THE PREAMBLE THERETO REFERS EXPRESSLY TO ARTICLE 2A ( ) OF REGULATION NO 986/OF THE COUNCIL , THUS SHOWING THAT IN FIXING THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AT 4.UNITS OF ACCOUNT PER KILOGRAMS AND THE AID FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER AT UNITS OF ACCOUNT PER KILOGRAMS THE COMMISSION TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACTORS LISTED IN THAT PROVISION IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH BETWEEN THOSE AIDS AN ' ' APPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP ' '  WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECOND SENTENCE OF ARTICLE 2A ( ).   MOREOVER , THE APPLICATION OF SUCH A ' ' RELATIONSHIP ' '  BETWEEN THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND THAT FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER IS NOT CONTRARY  TO THE PROHIBITION OF DISCRIMINATION LAID DOWN IN THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF  ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TREATY .   INDEED , THE FACT THAT THE FIXING OF THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK USED ' ' AS FEED ' '  MUST TAKE ACCOUNT OF SEVERAL FACTORS RELATING TO THE STATE OF THE MARKET FOR THAT PRODUCT , CONSIDERED IN PARTICULAR IN COMPARISON WITH THE MARKET FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER , IN ITSELF PRECLUDES A RELATIVELY LARGER AID FOR SKIMMED MILK THAN THAT FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER FROM BEING REGARDED AS INVOLVING DISCRIMINATION AS AGAINST THE LATTER PRODUCT SINCE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AIDS CORRESPONDS TO THE NEEDS OF THE MARKETS IN QUESTION AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMMON ORGANIZATION BY WHICH THE SAID PRODUCTS ARE COVERED .   FOR ALL THESE REASONS THE ANSWER TO THE FIRST QUESTION MUST THEREFORE BE THAT , BY THE WORDS ' ' APPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP ' ' , THE SECOND SENTENCE OF  ARTICLE 2A ( ) OF REGULATION NO 986/OF THE COUNCIL DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT THE AIDS FOR SKIMMED MILK AND FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER INTENDED FOR ANIMAL FEED AND LYING OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF ARTICLE ( ) ( D ) MUST NECESSARILY     BE FIXED AT AMOUNTS SUCH THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THOSE AIDS IS EQUAL TO THAT BETWEEN ONE KILOGRAM OF SKIMMED-MILK POWDER AND THE QUANTITY OF SKIMMED MILK FROM WHICH IT MAY BE OBTAINED . THEREFORE , SINCE IT PROCEEDS UPON A PROPER CONSTRUCTION OF THAT PROVISION , COMMISSION REGULATION NO 1049/DOES NOT DISPLAY ANY INVALIDATING FACTOR IN THIS RESPECT .  SECOND QUESTION   IN ITS SECOND QUESTION THE NATIONAL COURT WISHES TO KNOW WHETHER , IN THE EVENT OF THE ANSWER TO THE FIRST QUESTION BEING IN THE NEGATIVE , THE COMMISSION IN THIS CASE , IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1049/, EXCEEDED THE MARGIN OF DISCRETION WHICH IT ENJOYED BY VIRTUE OF ARTICLE 2A ( ) OF REGULATION NO 986/OF THE COUNCIL WHEN FIXING AN ' ' APPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP ' ' , WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECOND SENTENCE OF ARTICLE 2A ( ) OF THAT REGULATION , BETWEEN THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND THE AID FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER .   AS HAS ALREADY BEEN STATED , IN FIXING THE LEVEL OF AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER USED AS FEED , THE COMMISSION IS BOUND TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ALL THE FACTORS LISTED IN ARTICLE 2A ( ) OF REGULATION NO 986/SO THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO AIDS MAY ACCORD WITH THE NEEDS OF THE MARKET FOR EACH PRODUCT AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKETS IN QUESTION .   WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THAT ASSESSMENT , THE REASONS WHICH ARE SUCH AS TO JUSTIFY THE SIZE OF THE GAP TO BE CREATED BETWEEN THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND THE AID FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER MAY NOT BE BASED ON THE PARTICULAR POSITION OF CERTAIN UNDERTAKINGS OR GROUPS OF UNDERTAKINGS CONCERNED BUT MUST STEM FROM THE SECTOR CONCERNED AS A WHOLE AND FROM A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE RELATIONSHIPS SUBSISTING IN THE COMMON MARKET BETWEEN THE ONE PRODUCT AND THE OTHER .   ON THIS MATTER IT IS NOT OPEN TO DISPUTE , FIRST , THAT THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH SKIMMED MILK AND SKIMMED-MILK POWDER USED AS FEED ARE MARKETED AND UTILIZED ARE NOT IDENTICAL , PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THE ADVANTAGES IN TERMS OF CONSERVATION , STORAGE AND QUANTITIES REQUIRED WHICH SKIMMED-MILK POWDER     OFFERS IN COMPARISON WITH LIQUID SKIMMED MILK AND , SECONDLY , THAT SKIMMED-MILK POWDER HAS ACCESS TO OTHER MARKETS , SUCH AS THAT FOR FEEDINGSTUFFS FOR ANIMALS OTHER THAN YOUNG CALVES UNDER MORE FAVOURABLE CONDITIONS THAN LIQUID SKIMMED MILK .   IT IS ALSO INDISPUTABLE THAT SKIMMED-MILK POWDER MAY BENEFIT FROM THE ADVANTAGES OFFERED BY THE INTERVENTION SYSTEM PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 804/, WHEREAS SKIMMED MILK IS EXCLUDED FROM ACCESS TO SUCH A SYSTEM .   MOREOVER , THE OPPORTUNITY OF BEING OFFERED FOR INTERVENTION , WHICH IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO SKIMMED-MILK POWDER , IS THE SOURCE OF DIFFICULTIES IN THE FUNCTIONINING OF THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN QUESTION SINCE IT HAS PRECISELY THE EFFECT OF ENCOURAGING THE PROCESSING OF SKIMMED MILK INTO SKIMMED-MILK POWDER SO THAT IT MAY GAIN ACCESS TO THE INTERVENTION SYSTEM WITH THE RESULT THAT IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE AGGRAVATION OF THE FINANCIAL BURDEN AFFLICTING THAT SYSTEM . THE FIGURES SUPPLIED BY THE COMMISSION IN ANSWER TO A WRITTEN QUESTION PUT BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ON NOVEMBER ( WRITTEN QUESTION NO 1150/, OFFICIAL JOURNAL C , P . ) REVEAL PRECISELY THAT IN THE PROCESSING OF SKIMMED MILK INTO SKIMMED-MILK POWDER INCREASED BY 8.9% IN COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS YEAR .   THEREFORE , HAVING REGARD TO THESE FACTORS , IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT IN FIXING THE AIDS AT LEVELS SUCH THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND THAT FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER FOR USE AS FEED WAS 9.THE COMMISSION COMMITTED AN OBVIOUS ERROR OR A MISUSE OF POWER OR THAT IT CLEARLY EXCEEDED THE LIMITS OF ITS DISCRETIONARY POWER .   FOR THOSE REASONS , THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION MUST BE THAT IN FIXING THE AIDS AT LEVELS SUCH THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND THAT FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER FOR USE AS FEED WAS 9.THE COMMISSION DID NOT EXCEED , IN REGULATION NO 1049/, THE LIMITS OF THE MARGIN OF DISCRETION WHICH IT ENJOYS BY VIRTUE OF ARTICLE 2A OF REGULATION NO 986/WHEN FIXING THE AMOUNTS OF THE AIDS FOR THOSE PRODUCTS .  THIRD QUESTION   IN ITS THIRD QUESTION THE NATIONAL COURT ASKS WHETHER , IN THE EVENT OF THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION BEING IN THE NEGATIVE , THE LAST SENTENCE OF ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) OF REGULATION NO 986/MUST BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING     THAT A MAXIMUM PRICE , WITHIN THE MEANING OF THAT PROVISION , MUST ALWAYS BE FIXED FOR SKIMMED MILK WHICH IS SOLD TO FARMS FOR THE PURPOSE OF FEED IF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER IS FIXED IN SUCH A MANNER THAT A RELATIVELY HIGHER LEVEL OF AID IS PROVIDED FOR SKIMMED MILK THAN FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER AND WHETHER , CONSEQUENTLY , BECAUSE IT DOES NOT FIX SUCH A MAXIMUM PRICE , REGULATION NO 1049/MUST BE REGARDED AS INVALID .   ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) OF REGULATION NO 986/PROVIDES THAT AID MAY BE GRANTED FOR SKIMMED MILK PRODUCED AND PROCESSED IN A DAIRY AND SOLD TO FARMS WHERE IT IS USED AS FEED ' ' AT A PRICE NOT EXCEEDING ANY MAXIMUM PRICE WHICH MAY BE FIXED ' ' .   AS APPEARS FROM THE VERY WORDING OF THIS PROVISION , THE FIXING OF A MAXIMUM PRICE FOR THE SALE BY DAIRIES OF SKIMMED MILK TO FARMS WHICH USE IT FOR FEED IS ONLY PROVIDED FOR IN REGARD TO THAT TPYE OF MILK AND IS ENVISAGED AS A POSSIBILITY AND NOT AS A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR THE GRANT OF THE AID .   TO SUBMIT , AS DOES THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS , THAT SUCH A POSSIBILITY CONSISTS IN THE APPLICATION OF AN ' ' APPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP ' '  WHICH DOES NOT RESPECT THE FIXED RELATIONSHIP MENTIONED IN ARTICLE ( ) ( D ) OF REGULATION NO 986/AMOUNTS TO DEPRIVING THE SECOND SENTENCE OF ARTICLE 2A ( ) OF THAT REGULATION OF ANY USEFUL PURPOSE , SINCE THE MANDATORY APPLICATION OF A MAXIMUM PRICE WHENEVER THE AIDS IN QUESTION ARE NOT LAID DOWN IN ACCORDANCE WITH A FIXED RELATIONSHIP WOULD HAVE PRECISELY THE RESULT OF INTRODUCING INTO THE CRITERIA GOVERNING THE FIXING OF THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK WHICH ARE LAID DOWN BY THAT PROVISION AN AUTOMATIC MECHANISM WHICH IS EXCLUDED BY ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) OF REGULATION NO 986/AND WHICH IS CONTRARY TO THE PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING ARTICLE 2A ( ) OF THAT REGULATION .   HAVING REGARD TO THESE FACTORS , THEREFORE , THE ANSWER TO THE THIRD QUESTION MUST BE THAT ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) OF REGULATION NO 986/OF THE COUNCIL DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT A MAXIMUM PRICE MUST ALWAYS BE FIXED FOR SKIMMED MILK SOLD BY DAIRIES TO FARMS WHICH USE IT AS FEED WHENEVER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND SKIMMED-MILK POWDER IS FIXED IN SUCH A MANNER THAT SKIMMED MILK BENEFITS FROM A RELATIVELY LARGER AID THAN THAT GRANTED FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER . THE FACT THAT COMMISSION REGULATION     NO 1049/DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR THE FIXING OF SUCH A PRICE DOES NOT THEREFORE AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF THAT REGULATION .  FOURTH QUESTION   IN ITS FOURTH QUESTION THE NATIONAL COURT ASKS , FINALLY , WHETHER COMMISSION REGULATION NO 1049/SATISFIES THE OBLIGATION , LAID DOWN BY ARTICLE OF THE TREATY , TO STATE THE REASONS UPON WHICH IT IS BASED .   THE STATEMENT OF THE REASONS UPON WHICH THIS REGULATION IS BASED MUST BE REGARDED AND ASSESSED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE BODY OF LEGISLATION OF WHICH THIS MEASURE FORMS AN INTEGRAL PART .   ARTICLE 2A ( ) OF REGULATION NO 986/SETS FORTH THE RULES GOVERNING THE FIXING OF THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER FOR USE AS FEED .   THE FIRST RECITAL IN THE PREAMBLE TO COMMISSION REGULATION NO 1049/CONTAINS AN EXPRESS REFERENCE TO THAT PROVISION AND THUS ALLOWS RECOGNITION OF THE CRITERIA WHICH IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT BOTH FOR THE FIXING OF THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND FOR THE FIXING OF THE MARGIN TO BE MAINTAINED BETWEEN THAT AID AND THE AID FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER . THE SECOND RECITAL IN THE PREAMBLE TO THAT REGULATION STATES THAT THE AMOUNTS OF AID FIXED BY THE REGULATION FOLLOW FROM THE APPLICATION OF THOSE RULES ' ' TO THE PRESENT MARKET SITUATION ' ' .   PLACED THUS IN THE CONTEXT OF REGULATION NO 986/, WITHIN WHICH IT TAKES EFFECT , REGULATION NO 1049/SATISFIES THE REQUIREMENT , IMPOSED BY ARTICLE OF THE TREATY , TO STATE THE REASONS UPON WHICH IT IS BASED .  
Decision on costs
THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , WHICH HAS SUBMITTED OBSERVATIONS TO THE COURT , ARE NOT RECOVERABLE . SINCE THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE , IN SO FAR AS THE PARTIES TO THE MAIN ACTION ARE CONCERNED , IN THE NATURE OF A STEP IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THE NATIONAL COURT , THE DECISION ON COSTS IS A MATTER FOR THAT COURT .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ,   IN ANSWER TO THE QUESTIONS REFERRED TO IT BY THE COLLEGE VAN BEROEP VOOR HET BEDRIJFSLEVEN , THE HAGUE , BY JUDGMENT OF JANUARY , HEREBY RULES :   . BY THE WORDS ' ' APPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP ' '  THE SECOND SENTENCE OF ARTICLE 2A ( ) OF REGULATION NO 986/OF THE COUNCIL DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND THAT FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER WHICH ARE INTENDED FOR ANIMAL FEED AND DO NOT COME WITHIN ARTICLE ( ) ( D ) MUST NECESSARILY BE FIXED AT SUCH LEVELS THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THOSE AIDS IS EQUAL TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ONE KILOGRAM OF SKIMMED-MILK POWDER AND THE QUANTITY OF SKIMMED MILK FROM WHICH ONE KILOGRAM OF SKIMMED-MILK POWDER CAN BE OBTAINED . THEREFORE , SINCE IT PROCEEDS UPON A PROPER CONSTRUCTION OF THAT PROVISION , COMMISSION REGULATION NO 1049/DOES NOT DISPLAY , ON THIS POINT , ANY INVALIDATING FACTOR .  2.IN FIXING THE AIDS AT LEVELS SUCH THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND THAT FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER FOR USE AS FEED WAS 9., THE COMMISSION DID NOT EXCEED , IN REGULATION NO 1049/, THE LIMITS OF THE MARGIN OF DISCRETION WHICH IT ENJOYS BY VIRTUE OF ARTICLE 2A OF REGULATION NO 986/WHEN FIXING THE AIDS FOR THOSE PRODUCTS .  3.ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) OF REGULATION NO 986/OF THE COUNCIL DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT A MAXIMUM PRICE MUST ALWAYS BE FIXED FOR SKIMMED MILK SOLD BY DAIRIES TO FARMS WHICH USE IT AS ANIMAL FEED WHENEVER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AID FOR SKIMMED MILK AND THE AID FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER IS FIXED IN SUCH A MANNER THAT SKIMMED MILK BENEFITS FROM A RELATIVELY HIGHER LEVEL OF AID THAN THAT GRANTED FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER . THE FACT THAT COMMISSION REGULATION NO 1049/DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR THE FIXING OF SUCH A MAXIMUM PRICE DOES NOT THEREFORE AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF THAT REGULATION .      4.PLACED IN THE CONTEXT OF REGULATION NO 986/, WITHIN WHICH IT TAKES EFFECT , REGULATION NO 1049/SATISFIES THE REQUIREMENT , IMPOSED BY ARTICLE OF THE TREATY , TO STATE THE REASONS UPON WHICH IT IS BASED .
