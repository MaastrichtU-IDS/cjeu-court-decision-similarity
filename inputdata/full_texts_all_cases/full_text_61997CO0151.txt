Summary
For the purposes of granting leave to intervene, the Community judicature ascertains whether those seeking it are directly affected by the contested act and whether their interest in the result of the case is established. Similarly, it is necessary to establish a direct, existing interest in the grant by the Court of the order as sought and not an interest in relation to the pleas in law put forward.  The interest necessary in this respect must relate not merely to abstract legal arguments but to the actual form of order sought by a party to the main action.
