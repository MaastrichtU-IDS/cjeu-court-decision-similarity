Subject of the case
APPLICATION REQUESTING THE COURT TO DECLARE VOID OR , IN THE ALTERNATIVE , TO AMEND THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION OF JANUARY IMPOSING A FINE UNDER ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON MARCH , SIDERADRIA SPA ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' SIDERADRIA ' ), WHOSE REGISTERED OFFICE IS IN ADRIA ( ITALY ), BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY REQUESTING THE COURT PRIMARILY TO DECLARE VOID THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION OF JANUARY IMPOSING A FINE ON THE APPLICANT UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE ECSC TREATY AND ARTICLE OF GENERAL DECISION 1831/81/ECSC OF JUNE ESTABLISHING FOR UNDERTAKINGS IN THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY A MONITORING SYSTEM AND A NEW SYSTEM OF PRODUCTION QUOTAS IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) OR , IN THE ALTERNATIVE , TO REDUCE THE FINE IMPOSED .  ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENTS BEFORE THE COURT , SIDERADRIA IS AN ITALIAN STEEL UNDERTAKING WHICH PRODUCES CONCRETE REINFORCING BARS . THE UNDERTAKING , WHICH WAS FORMED IN , EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTIES IN THAT WERE SO SEVERE AS TO COMPEL IT TO CLOSE DOWN ALTOGETHER UNTIL APRIL . SINCE THAT DATE IT HAS RESUMED ITS ACTIVITIES ON A SMALLER SCALE .  BY DECISION 1831/, THE COMMISSION ESTABLISHED A NEW SYSTEM WHEREBY QUOTAS ARE IMPOSED NOT ONLY IN RESPECT OF EACH UNDERTAKING ' S PRODUCTION BUT ALSO IN RESPECT OF THE PART THEREOF WHICH MAY BE DELIVERED ON THE COMMON MARKET ( KNOWN AS ' THE DELIVERY QUOTA ' ). THAT DECISION PROVIDES THAT SUCH QUOTAS ARE TO BE CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF UNDERTAKINGS '  SALES DURING A GIVEN REFERENCE PERIOD .  THAT REFERENCE PERIOD COINCIDED IN PART WITH THE PERIOD IN WHICH SIDERADRIA WAS COMPELLED TO SUSPEND ITS ACTIVITIES . THAT IS WHY THE SALES FIGURES NOTIFIED BY SIDERADRIA TO THE COMMISSION RELATE IN THE MAIN TO . ON THE BASIS OF THOSE FIGURES , AND PURSUANT TO DECISION 1831/, THE COMMISSION DECIDED TO ALLOCATE TO SIDERADRIA FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF A PRODUCTION QUOTA OF TONNES AND A DELIVERY QUOTA OF TONNES , WHICH WERE NOTIFIED TO IT ON AUGUST .   IN OCTOBER , HOWEVER , SIDERADRIA APPLIED TO THE COMMISSION FOR AN ADJUSTMENT OF THOSE QUOTAS . IT POINTED OUT THAT THE FIGURES ON THE BASIS OF WHICH ITS PRODUCTION QUOTA HAD BEEN CALCULATED WERE INCORRECT . IT FURTHER MAINTAINED THAT THE DELIVERY QUOTA HAD BEEN FIXED BY REFERENCE TO A PERIOD IN WHICH IT HAD EXPORTED OVER 70% OF ITS PRODUCTION OUTSIDE THE COMMON MARKET AND THAT IT WOULD THEREFORE BE ABLE TO SELL WITHIN THE COMMON MARKET ONLY A VERY SMALL PROPORTION OF THE PRODUCTION ALLOCATED TO IT .  THE COMMISSION DID NOT TAKE ANY ACTION IN RESPONSE TO THAT LETTER . INSTEAD , ON FEBRUARY IT INFORMED SIDERADRIA THAT IT HAD ESTABLISHED THAT DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF THE PRODUCTION QUOTA HAD BEEN EXCEEDED BY TONNES AND THE DELIVERY QUOTA BY TONNES .  IN REPLY TO THE COMMISSION ' S LETTER , SIDERADRIA AGAIN APPLIED FOR AN ADJUSTMENT OF ITS PRODUCTION AND DELIVERY QUOTAS .  ON AUGUST THE COMMISSION REPLIED THAT A DETAILED EXAMINATION OF SIDERADRIA ' S SITUATION HAD REVEALED THAT ITS PRODUCTION QUOTA FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF HAD WRONGLY BEEN FIXED AT AN EXCESSIVELY LOW LEVEL . THE COMMISSION FIXED A NEW PRODUCTION QUOTA WHICH WAS GREATER THAN SIDERADRIA ' S PRODUCTION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF AND WHICH ABSORBED THE EXCESS ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMISSION .  MOREOVER , IN DECEMBER THE COMMISSION ESTABLISHED THAT SIDERADRIA FULFILLED THE CONDITIONS LAID DOWN BY ARTICLE ( ) OF DECISION 1831/, AS SUPPLEMENTED BY DECISION 2804/81/ECSC OF SEPTEMBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ). THAT PROVISION AUTHORIZES THE COMMISSION TO ADJUST A DELIVERY QUOTA WHERE THAT QUOTA HAS , IN PARTICULAR , CAUSED SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES TO AN UNDERTAKING . IN THE CASE OF SIDERADRIA , HOWEVER , THE ADJUSTMENT DID NOT RELATE TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF . ACCORDINGLY , THE EXCESS ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMISSION REMAINED UNAFFECTED .  BY DECISION OF JANUARY THE COMMISSION DECIDED TO IMPOSE ON SIDERADRIA ON ACCOUNT OF THAT EXCESS A FINE CALCULATED AT THE MAXIMUM RATE PROVIDED FOR BY ARTICLE OF DECISION 1831/AND AMOUNTING IN THIS CASE TO OF ECU .   THIS APPLICATION , THE ADMISSIBILITY OF WHICH IS NOT BEING CHALLENGED , IS DIRECTED AGAINST THAT DECISION . IN SUPPORT OF ITS APPLICATION , THE APPLICANT RELIES ON THREE SUBMISSIONS , NAMELY UNFAIRNESS OF THE CONTESTED DECISION , ERRONEOUS CALCULATION OF THE QUOTAS AND , FINALLY , BREACH OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE PROTECTION OF LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION . THE APPLICANT ALSO CHALLENGES THE AMOUNT OF THE FINE IMPOSED ON IT .  UNFAIRNESS OF THE CONTESTED DECISION  THE APPLICANT CONSIDERS THAT THE METHOD APPLIED TO CALCULATE THE QUOTAS IS UNFAIR IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS CASE . THE RATIO BETWEEN PRODUCTION AND DELIVERY QUOTAS CORRESPONDS TO THE RATIO BETWEEN SALES WITHIN AND SALES OUTSIDE THE COMMON MARKET DURING THE REFERENCE PERIOD . IN THE APPLICANT ' S CASE , THE REFERENCE PERIOD COINCIDES WITH THE PERIOD IN WHICH IT EFFECTED THE BULK OF ITS DELIVERIES OUTSIDE THE COMMON MARKET . ACCORDINGLY , AS A RESULT OF THE METHOD OF CALCULATION USED , THE DELIVERY QUOTA ALLOCATED TO IT IS VERY SMALL . THAT SYSTEM IS UNFAIR BECAUSE , THE APPLICANT MAINTAINS , EXTERNAL MARKETS ARE NOW INACCESSIBLE . THE APPLICANT IS THEREFORE HAMPERED BY AN EXCESSIVELY SMALL DELIVERY QUOTA AND CAN SELL ITS PRODUCTS ONLY WITHIN THE COMMON MARKET . IT IS UNFAIR , IN ITS VIEW , FOR A FINE TO BE IMPOSED IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES .  THE APPLICANT ALSO CONSIDERS THAT IT FULFILLED ALL THE CONDITIONS LAID DOWN IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR AN ADJUSTMENT OF ITS DELIVERY QUOTA UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF DECISION 1831/. IN SPITE OF REPEATED REQUESTS BY THE APPLICANT , THE COMMISSION REFUSED TO ADJUST THE DELIVERY QUOTA FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF RETROACTIVELY .  THE COMMISSION EMPHASIZES MERELY THAT IN CALCULATING THE APPLICANT ' S DELIVERY QUOTA IT SCRUPULOUSLY APPLIED THE RULES IN FORCE . SINCE THE APPLICANT DID NOT CONTEST THE DECISION FIXING THAT QUOTA , IT CANNOT DO SO IN PROCEEDINGS INSTITUTED AGAINST A DECISION IMPOSING A FINE UPON IT . AS FAR AS THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLE ( ) OF DECISION 1831/IS CONCERNED , THE COMMISSION POINTS OUT THAT IT AGREED IN DECEMBER TO A SLIGHT ADJUSTMENT OF THE APPLICANT ' S DELIVERY QUOTA WITHOUT RETROACTIVE EFFECT . IF THE APPLICANT WAS NOT CONTENT WITH THAT ADJUSTMENT , IT SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT AN ACTION CHALLENGING THAT DECISION .  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE DECISIONS ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION IN AUGUST AND DECEMBER , FIXING THE APPLICANT ' S DELIVERY QUOTA AND SUBSEQUENTLY ADJUSTING IT , HAVE BECOME DEFINITIVE IN VIEW OF THE APPLICANT ' S FAILURE TO CHALLENGE THEM WITHIN THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED BY THE TREATY . IT IS CLEAR FROM THE CONSISTENT CASE-LAW OF THE COURT THAT AN APPLICANT CANNOT , IN PROCEEDINGS FOR A DECLARATION THAT AN INDIVIDUAL DECISION IS VOID , RAISE AN OBJECTION OF ILLEGALITY AGAINST OTHER INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS ADDRESSED TO IT WHICH HAVE BECOME DEFINITIVE . ACCORDINGLY , IN SO FAR AS THE APPLICANT ' S SUBMISSION CALLS IN QUESTION THE DECISION FIXING THE DELIVERY QUOTA , IT MUST BE REJECTED .  ERRONEOUS CALCULATION OF THE DELIVERY QUOTA  THE APPLICANT CONTENDS IN THIS SUBMISSION THAT THE FIGURES NOTIFIED TO THE COMMISSION FOR THE CALCULATION OF THE DELIVERY QUOTA WERE INCORRECT . IN SUPPORT OF THAT CONTENTION , THE APPLICANT POINTS OUT THAT IT LEARNED THAT VALUE-ADDED TAX HAD BEEN PAID BY THE PURCHASERS OF ITS PRODUCTS . IN ITS VIEW , IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN NECESSARY TO PAY THAT TAX IF THOSE PRODUCTS HAD BEEN EXPORTED OUTSIDE ITALY . IT FOLLOWS THAT THEY WERE SOLD IN ITALY AND , CONSEQUENTLY , THAT THE DELIVERY QUOTA FIXED BY THE COMMISSION SHOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER .  ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSION , THIS SUBMISSION ALSO CHALLENGES INDIRECTLY THE DECISION FIXING THE APPLICANT ' S DELIVERY QUOTA , WHICH HAS BECOME DEFINITIVE . MOREOVER , THE COMMISSION EMPHASIZES THAT MERE INVOICES ARE NOT CONCLUSIVE IN DETERMINING THE FINAL DESTINATION OF PRODUCTS .  THIS SUBMISSION MUST BE REJECTED . IN SO FAR AS IT CALLS IN QUESTION THE COMMISSION ' S FINAL DECISION FIXING THE DELIVERY QUOTA , IT IS INADMISSIBLE . MOREOVER , AT THE HEARING THE APPLICANT DID NOT ESTABLISH EITHER THAT THE PAYMENT OF VALUE-ADDED TAX BY PURCHASERS CONSTITUTED CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF THE FINAL DESTINATION OF THE PRODUCT OR , CONSEQUENTLY , THAT THE VOLUME OF SALES OUTSIDE THE COMMON MARKET HAD BEEN MISCALCULATED . IN CERTAIN CASES , ITALIAN LEGISLATION REQUIRES PURCHASERS TO PAY VALUE-ADDED TAX EVEN WHERE THE PRODUCTS WHICH THEY BUY ARE ULTIMATELY INTENDED FOR EXPORT .  BREACH OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE PROTECTION OF LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION  THE APPLICANT COMPLAINS THAT THE COMMISSION FAILED TO WARN IT IN DUE TIME THAT IT HAD EXCEEDED ITS DELIVERY QUOTA . IN ADDITION , THE LONG PERIOD WHICH ELAPSED BETWEEN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE EXCESS AND THE DECISION IMPOSING A FINE RAISED THE APPLICANT ' S HOPES THAT A FAVOURABLE SOLUTION WOULD BE FOUND . IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES , THE IMPOSITION OF A FINE CONSTITUTES , IN ITS VIEW , A BREACH OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE PROTECTION OF LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION .  THE COMMISSION CONSIDERS THAT IT IS NOT UNDER A DUTY TO WARN UNDERTAKINGS , SINCE THEY ARE PERFECTLY WELL AWARE OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS AND OF THE PENALTY FOR NON-COMPLIANCE THEREWITH . FURTHER , THE DECISION IMPOSING THE FINES WAS PRECEDED BY DISCUSSIONS WHICH PREVENTED ANY FALSE HOPES FROM BEING AROUSED .  THE APPLICANT ' S FINAL SUBMISSION MUST ALSO BE REJECTED SINCE IT IS WRONGLY BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF THE PROTECTION OF LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS . THAT PRINCIPLE MAY NOT BE RELIED UPON BY AN UNDERTAKING WHICH HAS COMMITTED A MANIFEST INFRINGEMENT OF THE RULES IN FORCE . IT MUST BE ADDED THAT , IN THIS CASE , THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION INVOLVED DISCUSSIONS . THE APPLICANT MUST NECESSARILY HAVE REALIZED THAT A FINE WOULD BE IMPOSED ON IT .  AMOUNT OF THE FINE  IN SUPPORT OF ITS CLAIM THAT THE FINE IMPOSED ON IT SHOULD BE REDUCED , THE APPLICANT EMPHASIZES IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT THE FIGURES NOTIFIED TO THE COMMISSION FOR THE CALCULATION OF THE APPLICANT ' S DELIVERY QUOTA WERE INCORRECT .  HOWEVER , EVEN ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT AN UNDERTAKING ' S OWN ERRORS CAN CONSTITUTE A MITIGATING FACTOR , THE APPLICANT ' S ARGUMENT MUST BE REJECTED SINCE IT HAS NOT ESTABLISHED THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH ERRORS .  THE APPLICANT ALSO EMPHASIZES , WITH REFERENCE TO THE DECISION OF DECEMBER WHEREBY THE COMMISSION AGREED TO ADJUST ITS DELIVERY QUOTA , THAT THE COMMISSION ACKNOWLEDGED , WHILST THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE WAS IN PROGRESS , THAT THE DELIVERY QUOTA PREVIOUSLY FIXED WAS INADEQUATE . THE COMMISSION SHOULD , IN ITS VIEW , HAVE TAKEN THAT FACTOR INTO ACCOUNT IN FIXING THE AMOUNT OF THE FINE .  THE COMMISSION OBSERVES MERELY THAT THE RATE AT WHICH THE FINE WAS IMPOSED IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE WORDING OF THE RULES IN FORCE . IT ADDS THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT A FINE WAS IMPOSED FOR SUCH AN INFRINGEMENT AND THAT THERE WAS NO PRECEDENT FOR IT .  ARTICLE OF DECISION 1831/PROVIDES THAT A FINE , GENERALLY OF ECU , IS TO BE IMPOSED FOR EACH TONNE IN EXCESS . THAT AMOUNT MAY , HOWEVER , BE INCREASED TO 82.ECU WHERE AN UNDERTAKING HAS EXCEEDED ITS QUOTA BY 10% OR MORE , AS IN THIS CASE . THE COMMISSION IMPOSED THE MAXIMUM FINE ON THE APPLICANT .  IT IS TRUE THAT BY SELLING VIRTUALLY THE WHOLE OF ITS PRODUCTION QUOTA WITHIN THE COMMON MARKET THE APPLICANT EXCEEDED ITS DELIVERY QUOTA IN A PARTICULARLY FLAGRANT MANNER . HOWEVER , THE COMMISSION HAS ITSELF ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE DELIVERY QUOTA IMPOSED ON THE APPLICANT CAUSED THE LATTER SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES . THE COMMISSION SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THAT INTO ACCOUNT IN FIXING THE RATE OF THE FINE . ACCORDINGLY , THE FINE SHOULD BE REDUCED FROM ECU TO ECU , OR LIT .
