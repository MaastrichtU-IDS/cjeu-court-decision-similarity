BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON DECEMBER , THE APPLICANTS BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT COMMISSION LETTER NO OF OCTOBER IS VOID WITHOUT INDICATING IN THEIR APPLICATION AN ADDRESS FOR SERVICE IN THE PLACE WHERE THE COURT HAS ITS SEAT , NAMELY LUXEMBOURG .  BY LETTER OF DECEMBER , THE REGISTRAR OF THE COURT , ACTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE , CALLED UPON THE APPLICANTS TO INDICATE AN ADDRESS FOR SERVICE IN LUXEMBOURG BY JANUARY .   BY LETTER OF DECEMBER , RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JANUARY , THE APPLICANTS STATED THAT THEY COULD NOT MEET THE COSTS OF THE PROCEEDINGS AND FOR THAT REASON COULD NOT GIVE THE NAME OF A PERSON AUTHORIZED TO ACCEPT SERVICE . IN THE SAME LETTER , THEY APPLIED FOR LEGAL AID UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE .  BY ORDER OF THE COURT ( SECOND CHAMBER ) OF JUNE , THE APPLICANTS '  REQUEST FOR LEGAL AID WAS REFUSED .  BY LETTER OF DECEMBER , THE REGISTRAR OF THE COURT ONCE AGAIN CALLED UPON THE APPLICANTS TO INDICATE AN ADDRESS FOR SERVICE IN LUXEMBOURG AND GAVE THEM UNTIL DECEMBER TO PUT THE APPLICATION IN ORDER . IN A LETTER OF DECEMBER THE APPLICANTS ACKNOWLEDGED RECEIPT OF THE REGISTRAR ' S LETTER OF DECEMBER AND STATED THAT FOR FINANCIAL REASONS , THEY WERE NOT IN A POSITION TO PROVIDE AN ADDRESS FOR SERVICE IN LUXEMBOURG .  ACCORDING TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE , THE APPLICATION MUST STATE AN ADDRESS FOR SERVICE IN THE PLACE WHERE THE COURT HAS ITS SEAT . ARTICLE ( ) OF THE SAME RULES PROVIDES THAT , IF AN APPLICATION DOES NOT COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS SET OUT IN PARAGRAPHS ( ) TO ( ) OF ARTICLE AND IF THE APPLICATION IS NOT PUT IN ORDER WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD PRESCRIBED BY THE REGISTRAR , THE COURT MAY REJECT THE APPLICATION ON THE GROUND OF WANT OF FORM .  IN THIS CASE IT MUST BE OBSERVED THAT THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED FOR PUTTING THE APPLICATION IN ORDER , WHICH INITIALLY EXPIRED ON JANUARY , WAS EXTENDED TO DECEMBER BY LETTER OF DECEMBER . THE APPLICANTS THUS HAD AMPLE TIME TO SELECT AN ADDRESS FOR SERVICE .  AS REGARDS THE FINANCIAL GROUNDS WHICH , ACCORDING TO THE APPLICANTS , PREVENTED THEM FROM PROVIDING AN ADDRESS FOR SERVICE IN LUXEMBOURG , THOSE GROUNDS CANNOT BE ACCEPTED SINCE THE APPLICATION FOR LEGAL AID WAS REFUSED .  IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES , THE ACTION BROUGHT ON DECEMBER MUST BE HELD TO BE INADMISSIBLE .  UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS . SINCE THE APPLICANTS HAVE FAILED IN THEIR SUBMISSIONS , THEY MUST BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .
