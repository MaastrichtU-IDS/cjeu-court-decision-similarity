Summary
According to the Explanatory Notes to the Common Customs Tariff Nomenclature which constitute an important factor in the interpretation of that tariff ( see judgments of May in Case 183/Osram (( )) ECR and of February in Case 54/Hako-Schuh (( )) ECR ) subheading 92.B concerning "television image and sound recorders or reproducers" covers composite apparatus incorporating within the same housing a television camera and a video recorder . That subheading must be interpreted as meaning that it also includes such apparatus where the latter is unable to record television programmes except by means of an accessory which must be obtained separately in so far as the accessory has only a secondary function in the recording of television progammes and its price is negligible in relation to the price of the composite apparatus .
