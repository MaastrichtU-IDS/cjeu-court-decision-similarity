Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 805/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN BEEF AND VEAL ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ), ARTICLE ( ) AND ( ) OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1071/OF THE COMMISSION OF JULY LAYING DOWN DETAILED RULES FOR GRANTING PRIVATE-STORAGE AID FOR BEEF AND VEAL ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P . ), AND ARTICLE OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2778/OF THE COMMISSION OF OCTOBER ON THE GRANTING AT A STANDARD RATE FIXED IN ADVANCE OF PRIVATE-STORAGE AID FOR BEEF ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ), 
Grounds
BY AN ORDER OF APRIL , WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON MAY , THE VERWALTUNGSGERICHT FRANKFURT AM MAIN REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY THREE QUESTIONS ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 805/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN BEEF AND VEAL ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ), ARTICLE ( ) AND ( ) OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1071/OF THE COMMISSION OF JULY LAYING DOWN DETAILED RULES FOR GRANTING PRIVATE-STORAGE AID FOR BEEF AND VEAL ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P . ), AND ARTICLE OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2778/OF THE COMMISSION OF OCTOBER ON THE GRANTING AT A STANDARD RATE FIXED IN ADVANCE OF PRIVATE-STORAGE AID FOR BEEF ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ).  THE QUESTIONS WERE RAISED IN PROCEEDINGS BETWEEN FIRMA E . DANHUBER , MUNICH , ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' DANHUBER ' ) AND THE BUNDESANSTALT FUR LANDWIRTSCHAFTLICHE MARKTORDNUNG , FRANKFURT AM MAIN , ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' THE BUNDESANSTALT ' ), CONCERNING THE LATTER ' S DEMAND FOR REPAYMENT OF CERTAIN PRIVATE-STORAGE AID FOR BEEF AND VEAL PAID TO DANHUBER PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 805/.   THE ABOVE PROVISION PROVIDES THAT ' FRESH OR CHILLED '  BEEF AND VEAL MAY QUALIFY FOR PRIVATE-STORAGE AID . DETAILED RULES FOR APPLYING THE AID WERE ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 805/, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURE LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE THEREOF . IN PARTICULAR , ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1071/, AS AMENDED BY ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 2778/, PROVIDES THAT PRIVATE-STORAGE AID MAY BE GRANTED ONLY FOR PRODUCTS OBTAINED FROM ANIMALS SLAUGHTERED NOT MORE THAN DAYS PREVIOUSLY .  IN DANHUBER HAD ARRANGED FOR THE STORAGE , IN COLD-STORAGE PLANTS IN MUNICH AND MOOSBURG , OF FOREQUARTERS OF BEEF IMPORTED FROM BELGIUM AND OBTAINED FROM ANIMALS SLAUGHTERED LESS THAN DAYS PRIOR TO STORAGE . AT THE TIME WHEN THE FOREQUARTERS WERE LOADED ONTO LORRIES FOR TRANSPORTATION TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY THEY WERE NOT FROZEN . HOWEVER , THE QUARTERS ARRIVED FROZEN AT THE STORAGE PLANTS .  INITIALLY , PRIVATE-STORAGE AID WAS GRANTED IN RESPECT OF THE MEAT IN QUESTION , AS THE COMPETENT GERMAN AGENCY WAS UNAWARE THAT IT WAS FROZEN AT THE TIME OF STORAGE . THAT FACT WAS DISCOVERED IN THE COURSE OF AN INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCOUNTS IN , WHEREUPON THE FEDERAL OFFICE DEMANDED REPAYMENT OF THE AID FROM DANHUBER .  DANHUBER REFUSED TO REPAY THE AID AND BROUGHT THE MATTER BEFORE THE VERWALTUNGSGERICHT FRANKFURT AM MAIN .  THE VERWALTUNGSGERICHT DECIDED TO STAY THE PROCEEDINGS AND TO REFER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING :    ' ( ) IS MEAT FROM AN ANIMAL WHICH HAS BEEN SLAUGHTERED SUFFICIENTLY RECENTLY TO COMPLY WITH ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1071/OF THE COMMISSION OF JULY LAYING DOWN DETAILED RULES FOR GRANTING PRIVATE- STORAGE AID FOR BEEF AND VEAL ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P . ) OR ARTICLE OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2778/OF THE COMMISSION OF OCTOBER ON THE GRANTING AT A STANDARD RATE FIXED IN ADVANCE OF PRIVATE-STORAGE AID FOR BEEF ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) ' FRESH OR CHILLED '  WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 805/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN BEEF AND VEAL ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ) EVEN IF IT IS DELIVERED FROZEN TO THE PLACE OF STORAGE?   IF THAT QUESTION IS ANSWERED IN THE NEGATIVE :    ( ) IS IT COMPATIBLE WITH THE RULES GOVERNING PRIVATE STORAGE , IN PARTICULAR ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1071/, FOR THE STEPS PREPARATORY TO STORAGE , IN PARTICULAR THE FREEZING OF THE MEAT , TO BE CARRIED OUT AT A PLACE OTHER THAN THE PLACE OF ACTUAL STORAGE?   IF THAT QUESTION IS ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE :    ( ) IS THE AID FORFEITED IF THE STORER FAILS TO COMPLY WITH HIS OBLIGATION UNDER ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) OF REGULATION NO 1071/68?  '  THE BUNDESANSTALT AND THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES SUBMITTED WRITTEN OBSERVATIONS ON THOSE QUESTIONS , IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE OF THE PROTOCOL ON THE STATUTE OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE . IN ADDITION , AT THE HEARING ON APRIL , ORAL ARGUMENT WAS PRESENTED BY DANHUBER AND THE COMMISSION .  FIRST QUESTION  IN ITS FIRST QUESTION THE NATIONAL COURT SEEKS IN SUBSTANCE TO ESTABLISH WHETHER BEEF AND VEAL MAY QUALIFY FOR PRIVATE-STORAGE AID UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 805/IF THEY ARE ALREADY FROZEN ON ARRIVAL AT THE STORAGE PLANT .  IN ITS ORDER REQUESTING A PRELIMINARY RULING THE NATIONAL COURT POINTS OUT , IN THE FIRST PLACE , THAT THE MEAT STOCKED BY DANHUBER WAS OBTAINED FROM ANIMALS SLAUGHTERED LESS THAN DAYS PRIOR TO STORAGE AND THEREFORE FULFILLED THE CONDITIONS LAID DOWN BY ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1071/OF THE COMMISSION , AS AMENDED BY ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 2778/.   SECONDLY , THE NATIONAL COURT OBSERVES THAT SINCE MEAT DELIVERED FOR STORAGE MUST ALWAYS BE FROZEN , THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR WITHHOLDING THE AID PROVIDED FOR BY ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 805/SOLELY ON THE GROUND THAT THE MEAT IS ALREADY FROZEN ON ARRIVAL AT THE STORAGE PLANT .  THE BUNDESANSTALT AND THE COMMISSION TAKE THE VIEW THAT THE FIRST QUESTION SHOULD BE ANSWERED IN THE NEGATIVE .  ACCORDING TO THE BUNDESANSTALT , THE EXCLUSION OF FROZEN MEAT FROM THE BENEFIT OF STORAGE AID MAY BE INFERRED FROM THE WORDING OF SUBHEADING 02.A II ( A ) ( BB ) OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF , REFERRED TO IN THE ANNEX TO REGULATION NO 2778/, WHICH MENTIONS ONLY ' FRESH OR CHILLED '  BEEF AND VEAL . IN THE OPINION OF THE BUNDESANSTALT , THAT EXPRESSION SHOULD BE INTERPRETED IN THE LIGHT OF THE EXPLANATORY NOTES OF THE CUSTOMS COOPERATION COUNCIL , WHICH DIVIDE MEAT INTO THREE CATEGORIES ( FRESH MEAT , CHILLED MEAT , AND FROZEN MEAT ) ACCORDING TO TEMPERATURE .  THE BUNDESANSTALT ALSO EMPHASIZES THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH WOULD ARISE IF FROZEN MEAT WERE TO QUALIFY FOR STORAGE AID , IN VIEW OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF CHECKING IN PARTICULAR THE DATE OF SLAUGHTER AND THE ORIGIN OF THE PRODUCT IF IT IS ALREADY FROZEN ON DELIVERY FOR STORAGE .  THE COMMISSION SHARES THE OPINION OF THE BUNDESANSTALT AS FAR AS THE EXCLUSION OF FROZEN MEAT FROM THE BENEFIT OF STORAGE AID IS CONCERNED . IT REFERS , IN PARTICULAR , TO ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1071/, MENTIONED ABOVE , WHICH PROVIDES THAT : ' THE AMOUNT OF AID SHALL BE FIXED PER UNIT OF WEIGHT ASCERTAINED ON ENTRY INTO STORE AND BEFORE FREEZING . '  ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSION , THAT PROVISION IS NOT APPLICABLE IF MEAT INTENDED FOR STORAGE IS DELIVERED FROZEN .  IN ORDER TO ANSWER THE FIRST QUESTION RAISED BY THE NATIONAL COURT IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER THE WORDING OF THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF COMMUNITY LAW .  ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 805/PROVIDES THAT , IN ORDER TO PREVENT OR MITIGATE A SUBSTANTIAL FALL IN PRICES , CERTAIN MEASURES , INCLUDING AID FOR PRIVATE STORAGE , MAY BE TAKEN . ARTICLE ( ) PROVIDES THAT SUCH MEASURES MAY BE TAKEN ' FOR ADULT BOVINE ANIMALS AS WELL AS FOR FRESH OR CHILLED MEAT OF SUCH ANIMALS , PRESENTED IN THE FORM OF CARCASSES , HALF CARCASSES , COMPENSATED QUARTERS , FOREQUARTERS OR HINDQUARTERS ' .  IT IS CLEAR FROM THOSE PROVISIONS THAT NO STORAGE AID WAS PROVIDED IN THE CASE OF FROZEN MEAT , EVEN THOUGH SUCH MEAT IS SPECIFICALLY DEALT WITH IN OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE SAME REGULATION .  THAT CONCLUSION IS BORNE OUT BY AN EXAMINATION OF COMMISSION REGULATIONS NO 1071/AND NO 2778/, MENTIONED ABOVE , WHICH LAY DOWN DETAILED RULES FOR GRANTING THE AID IN QUESTION .  ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1071/, ACCORDING TO WHICH THE AMOUNT OF THE AID IS TO BE DETERMINED BY THE WEIGHT ASCERTAINED ' ON ENTRY INTO STORE AND BEFORE FREEZING ' , PRESUPPOSES THAT THE FREEZING OF MEAT INTENDED FOR STORAGE TAKES PLACE ' ON ENTRY INTO STORE '  AND NOT BEFORE .  FURTHERMORE , ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 2778/DEFINES THE PRODUCTS ELIGIBLE FOR STORAGE AID BY REFERENCE TO SUBHEADING 02.A II ( A ) ( BB ) OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF . THAT SUBHEADING , AS IT APPEARS BOTH IN THE VERSION OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF APPLICABLE ON THE DATE OF THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF REGULATION NO 2778/( SEE REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1/OF THE COUNCIL OF DECEMBER , OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) AND IN SUBSEQUENT VERSIONS , REFERS EXCLUSIVELY TO ' FRESH OR CHILLED '  BEEF .  AS REGARDS THE DEFINITION OF ' FRESH OR CHILLED MEAT '  AS DISTINCT FROM ' FROZEN MEAT ' , IN THE ABSENCE OF AN INDEPENDENT DEFINITION OF THOSE EXPRESSIONS EITHER IN REGULATION NO 805/OR IN THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF , IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT , ACCORDING TO CURRENT USAGE , THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN FRESH , CHILLED AND FROZEN MEAT DEPENDS ON THE TEMPERATURE AT WHICH THE MEAT IS KEPT .  MOREOVER , THE SAME CRITERION IS ADOPTED IN THE EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE NOMENCLATURE OF THE CUSTOMS COOPERATION COUNCIL . THE COURT HAS CONSISTENTLY HELD ( SEE , IN PARTICULAR , THE JUDGMENT OF JULY IN CASE 789/HAUPTZOLLAMT KOLN-RHEINAU V CHEM-TEC ( ) ECR ) THAT THOSE NOTES MAY BE USED IN CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS THOSE OF THE PRESENT CASE FOR THE PURPOSE OF INTERPRETING THE TERMS OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF .  ON THE OTHER HAND , THE DATE OF SLAUGHTER IS NOT A DECISIVE CRITERION FOR ESTABLISHING WHETHER THE MEAT IN QUESTION IS ' FRESH OR CHILLED MEAT '  WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 805/.   ADMITTEDLY , ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1071/, AS AMENDED BY ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 2778/, CONFINES ELIGIBILITY FOR STORAGE AID TO PRODUCTS ' OBTAINED FROM ANIMALS SLAUGHTERED NOT MORE THAN DAYS PREVIOUSLY ' . HOWEVER , THAT PROVISION CANNOT BE REGARDED AS SEEKING TO DEFINE ' FRESH OR CHILLED MEAT '  BY REFERENCE TO A CRITERION WHICH IS CONCERNED NOT WITH THE TEMPERATURE OF THE MEAT BUT WITH THE LENGTH OF THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THE DATE OF SLAUGHTER AND THE DATE OF DELIVERY FOR STORAGE .  IT IS CLEAR FROM THE SECOND RECITAL IN THE PREAMBLE TO REGULATION NO 1071/THAT THE COMMISSION , WHICH , MOREOVER , WAS EMPOWERED BY ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 805/ONLY TO ADOPT THE ' DETAILED RULES '  CONCERNING THE STORAGE-AID SCHEME AND NOT TO LAY DOWN AN INDEPENDENT DEFINITION OF THE PRODUCTS ELIGIBLE FOR SUCH AID , INTENDED MERELY TO LIMIT THE GRANTING OF SUCH AID TO ' THE STORAGE OF PRODUCTS OBTAINED FROM RECENT SLAUGHTERINGS ' , IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OBJECTIVES PURSUED BY THE COUNCIL IN INTRODUCING STORAGE AID . IN SO DOING , THE COMMISSION LAID DOWN IN THE CASE OF PRODUCTS QUALIFYING FOR STORAGE AID UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 805/A FURTHER CONDITION , THE TERMS OF WHICH WERE , MOREOVER , MADE LESS RESTRICTIVE BY ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 2778/, WHICH RAISED FROM SIX TO DAYS THE MAXIMUM PERIOD PERMITTED BETWEEN SLAUGHTERING AND STORAGE .  THE ANSWER TO THE FIRST QUESTION SUBMITTED BY THE NATIONAL COURT MUST THEREFORE BE THAT WHERE MEAT IS DELIVERED FROZEN TO THE PLACE OF STORAGE , IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ' FRESH OR CHILLED '  MEAT WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 805/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE , AND HENCE CANNOT QUALIFY FOR THE PRIVATE-STORAGE AID PROVIDED FOR BY THAT ARTICLE .  SECOND QUESTION  IN ITS SECOND QUESTION THE NATIONAL COURT ASKS , IN ESSENCE , WHETHER A CONSIGNMENT OF BEEF OR VEAL INTENDED FOR STORAGE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT RULES OF COMMUNITY LAW MAY BE FROZEN AT A PLACE OTHER THAN THE PLANT IN WHICH IT IS TO BE STORED .  IT HAS BEEN HELD , IN THE ANSWER TO THE FIRST QUESTION SUBMITTED BY THE NATIONAL COURT , THAT BEEF AND VEAL DELIVERED FROZEN TO THE PLACE OF STORAGE CANNOT QUALIFY FOR THE STORAGE AID IN QUESTION . IT FOLLOWS THAT THE MEAT MUST BE FROZEN AT THE PLACE OF ACTUAL STORAGE .  THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION SUBMITTED BY THE NATIONAL COURT MUST THEREFORE BE THAT IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE RULES OF COMMUNITY LAW GOVERNING PRIVATE-STORAGE AID FOR BEEF AND VEAL FOR THE STEPS PREPARATORY TO STORAGE , IN PARTICULAR THE FREEZING OF THE MEAT , TO BE CARRIED OUT AT A PLACE OTHER THAN THE PLACE OF ACTUAL STORAGE .  THIRD QUESTION  SINCE THE THIRD QUESTION WAS SUBMITTED BY THE NATIONAL COURT ONLY IN THE EVENT OF THE SECOND QUESTION BEING ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE , THERE IS NO NEED TO ANSWER IT .  
Decision on costs
COSTS THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , WHICH HAS SUBMITTED OBSERVATIONS TO THE COURT , ARE NOT RECOVERABLE . AS THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE , IN SO FAR AS THE PARTIES TO THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS ARE CONCERNED , IN THE NATURE OF A STEP IN THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE NATIONAL COURT , THE DECISION ON COSTS IS A MATTER FOR THAT COURT .

( ) IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE RULES OF COMMUNITY LAW GOVERNING PRIVATE-STORAGE AID FOR BEEF AND VEAL FOR THE STEPS PREPARATORY TO STORAGE , IN PARTICULAR THE FREEZING OF THE MEAT , TO BE CARRIED OUT AT A PLACE OTHER THAN THE PLACE OF ACTUAL STORAGE .
