Subject of the case
APPLICATION, AT THE PRESENT STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS, FOR A DECLARATION OF THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE ACTION IN WHICH THE APPLICANT COMPANY CLAIMS THAT GOODS REFERRED TO UNDER HEADING 11.OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF, IN PARTICULAR FLAKED BARLEY ( SUBHEADING 11.E I ( B ) ) AND CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF CEREAL GROATS AND MAIZE MEAL ( SUBHEADING 11.A V ( A ) ) SHALL BE INCLUDED IN THE LIST OF PRODUCTS CONTAINED IN ANNEX I TO REGULATION NO 1014/OF THE COMMISSION OF MAY FIXING THE COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS PROVIDED FOR BY REGULATION NO 974/ON CERTAIN MEASURES OF CONJUNCTURAL POLICY TO BE TAKEN IN AGRICULTURE FOLLOWING THE TEMPORARY WIDENING OF THE MARGINS OF FLUCTUATION FOR THE CURRENCIES OF CERTAIN MEMBER STATES AND TO REGULATION NO 1272/OF THE COMMISSION OF JUNE ALTERING THE SAID COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS, 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION OF JULY 1971, THE APPLICANT HAS, UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY, CLAIMED ANNULMENT OF THE COMMUNICATION OF JUNE IN WHICH THE COMMISSION REFUSED TO ACCEDE TO ITS REQUEST, SUBMITTED ON MAY AND CONFIRMED ON JUNE FOLLOWING, THAT GOODS REFERRED TO UNDER HEADING 11.OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARRIF, IN PARTICULAR FLAKED BARLEY ( SUBHEADING 11.E I ( B ) ) AND CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF MAIZE GROATS AND MEAL ( SUBHEADING 11.A V ( A ) ), SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE LIST OF PRODUCTS CONTAINED IN ANNEX I TO REGULATION NO 1014/OF THE COMMISSION OF MAY FIXING THE COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS PROVIDED FOR BY REGULATION NO 974/OF THE COUNCIL ON CERTAIN MEASURES OF CONJUNCTURAL POLICY TO BE TAKEN IN AGRICULTURE FOLLOWING THE TEMPORARY WIDENING OF THE MARGINS OF FLUCTUATION FOR THE CURRENCIES OF CERTAIN MEMBER STATES ( JO L 110, 1971, P . ) AND IN ANNEX I TO REGULATION NO 1272/OF THE COMMISSION OF JUNE ALTERING THE SAID COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS ( JO L 133, 1971, P . ).  IN THE ALTERNATIVE, THE APPLICANT CLAIMS UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY THAT THE COURT SHOULD FIND THAT THE COMMISSION HAS, IN BREACH OF THE TREATY, FAILED TO GIVE A RULING ON ITS REQUEST .  SINCE THE COMMISSION REQUESTED THAT ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE SHOULD BE APPLIED, THE COURT DECIDED TO RULE ON THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE ACTION WITHOUT GOING INTO THE SUBSTANCE .  SINCE THE COMMISSION, WITHIN THE TIME-LIMIT FIXED BY ARTICLE 175, DEFINED ITS POSITION IN ITS COMMUNICATION OF JUNE 1971, THE CONDITIONS FOR APPLICATION OF THAT ARTICLE ARE NOT SATISFIED; THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE ACTION MUST, IN CONSEQUENCE, BE CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF ARTICLE ALONE .  SINCE THE DEFINITION BY THE COMMISSION OF ITS POSITION AMOUNTS TO A REJECTION IT MUST BE APPRAISED IN THE LIGHT OF THE OBJECT OF THE REQUEST TO WHICH IT CONSTITUTED A REPLY . THE OBJECT OF THE REQUEST WAS THE INCLUSION IN THE ANNEX TO REGULATIONS NOS 1014/AND 1272/OF THE PRODUCTS OF CONCERN TO THE APPLICANT; IT ACCORDINGLY SOUGHT AMENDMENT OF A REGULATION BY AN ACT WHICH WOULD ITSELF HAVE TAKEN THE FORM OF A REGULATION . IN FACT, INCLUSION IN THE ANNEX TO THE REGULATIONS CONCERNED OF THE PRODUCTS REFERRED TO BY THE APPLICANT WOULD HAVE HAD THE EFFECT OF APPLYING THE SYSTEM OF COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS TO ALL EXPORTS AND, FURTHERMORE, TO ALL IMPORTS OF THE PRODUCTS INVOLVED TO THE ADVANTAGE OR THE DISADVANTAGE, AS THE CASE MAY BE, OF ANY AND EVERY EXPORTER OR IMPORTER . SUCH A PROVISION WOULD HAVE AFFECTED THE APPLICANT ONLY IN SO FAR AS IT BELONGS TO A CATEGORY VIEWED IN THE ABSTRACT AND IN ITS ENTIRETY AND NOT AS THE PERSON TO WHOM AN ACT OF DIRECT AND INDIVIDUAL CONCERN TO HIM WAS ADDRESSED . IN CONSEQUENCE THERE IS A WANT OF THE CONDITIONS TO WHICH UNDER ARTICLE ( ) PROCEEDINGS BY INDIVIDUALS AGAINST THE ACTS OF THE INSTITUTIONS ARE SUBJECT .  THE APPLICATION MUST THEREFORE BE DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE .  
Decision on costs
UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY SHALL BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .  THE APPLICATION HAS BEEN DECLARED INADMISSIBLE .  
Operative part
