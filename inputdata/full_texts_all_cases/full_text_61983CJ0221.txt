Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON OCTOBER , THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION BEFORE THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT , BY NOT ADOPTING WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE MEASURES NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 78/1026/EEC OF DECEMBER AND BY NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTING COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 78/1027/EEC OF DECEMBER , THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY .   THE AIM OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 78/OF DECEMBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) IS TO ENSURE THE MUTUAL RECOGNITION OF DIPLOMAS , CERTIFICATES AND OTHER EVIDENCE OF FORMAL QUALIFICATIONS IN VETERINARY MEDICINE . IT ALSO PROVIDES FOR MEASURES TO FACILITATE THE EFFECTIVE EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT OF ESTABLISHMENT AND FREEDOM TO PROVIDE SERVICES .   THE AIM OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 78/OF DECEMBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) IS TO COORDINATE PROVISIONS LAID DOWN BY LAW , REGULATION OR ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION IN RESPECT OF THE ACTIVITIES OF VETERINARY SURGEONS AND IN PARTICULAR TO ENSURE THAT THE TRAINING OF VETERINARY SURGEONS IS COMPARABLE IN THE MEMBER STATES SO AS TO ENABLE DIPLOMAS , CERTIFICATES AND OTHER QUALIFICATIONS TO BE MUTUALLY RECOGNIZED .   THE TWO DIRECTIVES PROVIDE , IN ARTICLES ( ) AND ( ) RESPECTIVELY , THAT THE MEMBER STATES MUST ADOPT THE MEASURES NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THEM     WITHIN TWO YEARS OF THEIR NOTIFICATION , THAT IS TO SAY BY DECEMBER , AND THAT THEY MUST IMMEDIATELY INFORM THE COMMISSION THEREOF .   HAVING RECEIVED NO INFORMATION FROM THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC , THE COMMISSION , BY LETTER OF DECEMBER , INITIATED THE PROCEDURE PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF THE TREATY . IN REPLY TO THAT LETTER THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATION OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC TO THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES INFORMED THE COMMISSION ON MARCH THAT THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS HAD APPROVED A BILL COVERING THE RELEVANT MATTERS .   ON JUNE THE COMMISSION , CONSIDERING THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT ' S REPLY UNSATISFACTORY BECAUSE NO LEGISLATIVE MEASURE HAD BEEN ADOPTED , DELIVERED A REASONED OPINION WITH WHICH THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC WAS REQUESTED TO COMPLY WITHIN A PERIOD OF ONE MONTH . BY LETTER OF SEPTEMBER THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC FORWARDED THE AFOREMENTIONED BILL , STATING THAT IT HAD BEEN LAID BEFORE PARLIAMENT ON MARCH AFTER THE COMMITTEE ON CONSTITUTIONAL MATTERS HAD SIGNIFIED ITS APPROVAL .   THE COMMISSION , CONSIDERING THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAD NOT ADOPTED ANY MEASURE TO COMPLY WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED DIRECTIVES , BROUGHT THIS ACTION FOR A DECLARATION THAT IT HAD FAILLED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS .  THE APPLICANT ' S CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO THE QUESTION OF FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 78/OF DECEMBER THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DISPUTE THAT IT HAS NOT FULFILLED ITS OBLIGATION TO IMPLEMENT THIS DIRECTIVE . IT POINTS OUT , HOWEVER , THAT IT HAS LAID A BILL BEFORE PARLIAMENT CONTAINING APPROPRIATE PROVISIONS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DIRECTIVE . NEVERTHELESS , THE PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE IN RELATION TO THAT BILL COULD NOT BE COMPLETED OWING TO THE PREMATURE DISSOLUTION OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES . THE PROCEDURE FOR PASSING THE BILL MUST THEREFORE BE REPEATED .   THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES CANNOT EXPUNGE THE INFRINGEMENT OF THE TREATY WITH WHICH THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC IS CHARGED . THE COURT HAS CONSISTENTLY HELD THAT A     MEMBER STATE MAY NOT PLEAD PROVISIONS , PRACTICES OR CIRCUMSTANCES IN ITS INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM TO JUSTIFY A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OBLIGATIONS AND TIME-LIMITS LAID DOWN IN COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES .   IT MUST THEREFORE BE DECLARED THAT , BY NOT ADOPTING WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 78/OF DECEMBER , THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY .  THE APPLICANT ' S CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO THE FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT FULLY COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 78/OF DECEMBER WHEREAS THROUGHOUT THE PROCEDURE PRIOR TO THE APPLICATION TO THE COURT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC CONFINED ITSELF TO STATING THAT , IN ORDER TO INCORPORATE THE DIRECTIVE INTO NATIONAL LAW , A LAW EMPOWERING IT TO ADOPT THE NECESSARY MEASURES WAS IN PREPARATION , IT HAS ASSERTED , FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ITS DEFENCE , THAT THE DIRECTIVE WAS ALREADY FULLY IMPLEMENTED BY THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF STUDIES AND DIPLOMAS FOR THE VETERINARY PROFESSION LAID DOWN IN ORDER NO OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF OCTOBER ( GAZZETTA UFFICIALE ( OFFICIAL GAZETTE ) NO OF . . ). ACCORDING TO THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT , THAT ORDER , WHICH PROVIDES FOR A FIVE-YEAR COURSE OF STUDIES AT UNIVERSITY AND WHICH DEFINES IN ITS ANNEX THE VARIOUS SUBJECTS COVERED BY THE COURSE LEADING TO A DOCTOR ' S DEGREE IN VETERINARY MEDICINE , FULFILS THE REQUIREMENTS LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 78/AND IN THE ANNEX THERETO .   IN ITS REPLY THE COMMISSION NOTED THE EXISTENCE OF ORDER NO OF OCTOBER BUT MADE IT CLEAR THAT IT CONSIDERED THAT THE PROVISIONS IT CONTAINED DID NOT FULLY IMPLEMENT THE DIRECTIVE BECAUSE THE ANNEX TO THE ORDER WHICH SET OUT THE CURRICULUM FOR A DOCTOR ' S DEGREE IN VETERINARY MEDICINE IN ITALY , DID NOT INCLUDE THREE OF THE SUBJECTS LISTED IN THE ANNEX TO DIRECTIVE NO 78/LAYING DOWN A HARMONIZED CURRICULUM FOR VETERINARY SURGEONS . THOSE THREE SUBJECTS WERE PREVENTIVE MEDICINE , FOOD HYGIENE AND TECHNOLOGY AND ANIMAL ETHOLOGY AND PROTECTION .   IT MUST BE NOTED THAT AT THE HEARING THE COMMISSION ACCEPTED THAT THE ORDER OF OCTOBER IMPLEMENTED THE DIRECTIVE SATISFACTORILY AS FAR AS TRAINING     IN PREVENTIVE MEDICINE WAS CONCERNED . THE COMMISSION ' S CONCLUSIONS ARE THEREFORE LIMITED TO THE FAILURE TO INCLUDE THE SUBJECTS OF ' ' FOOD HYGIENE AND TECHNOLOGY ' '  AND ' ' ANIMAL ETHOLOGY AND PROTECTION ' '  IN THE CURRICULUM ADOPTED IN ITALY FOR VETERINARY SURGEONS .   THE INTRODUCTORY WORDS OF THE ANNEX TO DIRECTIVE NO 78/STATE THAT : ' ' THE PROGRAMME OF STUDIES LEADING TO THE DIPLOMA , CERTIFICATE OR OTHER EVIDENCE OF FORMAL QUALIFICATIONS IN VETERINARY MEDICINE SHALL INCLUDE AT LEAST THE SUBJECTS LISTED BELOW . INSTRUCTION IN ONE OR MORE OF THESE SUBJECTS MAY BE GIVEN AS PART OF , OR IN ASSOCIATION WITH , OTHER COURSES ' ' . THE ACTUAL TITLES OF THE SUBJECTS AND DISCIPLINES FORMING THE CURRICULUM FOR VETERINARY SURGEONS ARE NOT THEREFORE REQUIRED TO BE TRANSPOSED WORD FOR WORD INTO THE LEGAL SYSTEMS OF THE MEMBER STATES ; THE ANNEX MERELY REQUIRES A TRANSPOSITION WHICH IS SUFFICIENTLY FAITHFUL TO ENSURE THAT TRAINING COURSES IN THE MEMBER STATES ARE COMPARABLE SO AS TO ENABLE DIPLOMAS TO BE MUTUALLY RECOGNIZED .   THE GOVERNMENT OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC POINTS OUT THAT THE ACQUISITION OF ADEQUATE KNOWLEDGE , WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE DIRECTIVE , OF THE SUBJECT OF ' ' FOOD HYGIENE AND TECHNOLOGY ' '  IS ENSURED BY COMPULSORY INSTRUCTION IN THE SUBJECT ENTITLED ' ' INSPECTION AND CONTROL OF FOODSTUFFS OF ANIMAL ORIGIN ' '  MENTIONED IN GROUP OF THE ANNEX TO THE ORDER ; THE PERFORMANCE OF SUCH INSPECTION AND CONTROL DUTIES NECESSARILY PRESUPPOSES A KNOWLEDGE OF METHODS OF PRODUCING AND MARKETING FOODSTUFFS INTENDED FOR CONSUMPTION .   AS THE COMMISSION SUBMITTED AND AS IS CLEAR FROM THE ORAL ARGUMENT BEFORE THE COURT , THE DISCIPLINE MENTIONED IN GROUP OF THE ANNEX TO ORDER NO COVERS ONLY PART OF THE SUBJECT ' ' FOOD HYGIENE AND TECHNOLOGY ' '  REFERRED TO BY THE DIRECTIVE . THE COMMISSION ALSO RIGHTLY SUBMITTED THAT CERTAIN SUBJECTS DIRECTLY RELATED TO FOOD HYGIENE AND TECHNOLOGY ARE MENTIONED IN ORDER NO AMONGST THE SUPPLEMENTARY SUBJECTS , WHICH ARE OPTIONAL FOR STUDENTS OF VETERINARY MEDICINE . CONSEQUENTLY , IT WOULD BE QUITE POSSIBLE FOR SUCH STUDENTS TO OBTAIN A DOCTOR ' S DEGREE IN VETERINARY MEDICINE WITHOUT RECEIVING FULL TRAINING IN THAT SUBJECT , WHICH IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE .       THE COMMISSION IS THEREFORE RIGHT IN CONSIDERING THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS NOT FULLY TRANSPOSED DIRECTIVE NO 78/IN THIS REGARD .   AS REGARDS THE SUBJECT ENTITLED ' ' ANIMAL ETHOLOGY AND PROTECTION ' ' , WHICH IS MENTIONED IN GROUP OF THE ANNEX TO DIRECTIVE NO 78/, THE GOVERNMENT OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC MAINTAINS THAT THE ACQUISITION OF ADEQUATE KNOWLEDGE OF THAT SUBJECT IS ENSURED BY COMPULSORY INSTRUCTION IN THE SUBJECTS LISTED IN GROUP OF THE ANNEX TO ORDER NO , WHICH ARE AS FOLLOWS :    ' ' ZOOTECHNY :    ( ) HYGIENE , APPEARANCE OF ANIMALS , ETHNOLOGY ;   ( 2)GENETICS AND BREEDING ' ' .   IT IS CLEAR FROM THE ORAL ARGUMENTS ADVANCED BEFORE THE COURT THAT THE SUBJECTS LISTED IN GROUP OF THE ANNEX TO ORDER NO DO NOT CORRESPOND TO THE SUBJECT ENTITLED ' ' ANIMAL ETHOLOGY AND PROTECTION ' '  MENTIONED IN THE ANNEX TO COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 78/. THE SUBJECTS SPECIFIED BY THE DIRECTIVE ESSENTIALLY CONCERN THE TEACHING OF THE SCIENCE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR WHEREAS THE SUBJECTS LISTED IN GROUP OF THE ITALIAN CURRICULUM ARE RELATED TO THE STUDY OF ANIMAL POPULATIONS AND TECHNIQUES OF REPRODUCTION AND BREEDING .   IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THE COMMISSION IS ALSO RIGHT IN CONSIDERING THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS NOT FULLY TRANSPOSED COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 78/IN THIS REGARD EITHER .   ACCORDINGLY , IT MUST BE HELD THAT :   BY NOT ADOPTING WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 78/OF DECEMBER , THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY ; AND THAT :   BY NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTING COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 78/OF DECEMBER AND BY FAILING TO PROVIDE FOR COMPULSORY INSTRUCTION IN THE SUBJECTS     REFERRED TO AS ' ' ANIMAL ETHOLOGY AND PROTECTION ' '  AND ' ' FOOD HYGIENE AND TECHNOLOGY ' '  AS PART OF ITS CURRICULUM FOR VETERINARY SURGEONS , THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY .
