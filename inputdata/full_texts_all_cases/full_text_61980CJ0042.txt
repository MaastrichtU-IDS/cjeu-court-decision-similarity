Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY BY NOT IMPLEMENTING WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 73/OF NOVEMBER , ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS , REGULATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO THE CERTIFICATION AND MARKING OF WIRE-ROPES , CHAINS AND HOOKS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ) AND ALSO COMMISSION DIRECTIVE NO 76/OF APRIL , ADAPTING THE SAID COUNCIL DIRECTIVE TO TECHNICAL PROGRESS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ), 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON FEBRUARY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NEEDED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 73/OF NOVEMBER ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS , REGULATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO THE CERTIFICATION AND MARKING OF WIRE-ROPES , CHAINS AND HOOKS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ), AND WITH COMMISSION DIRECTIVE NO 76/OF APRIL , ADAPTING THE SAID COUNCIL DIRECTIVE TO TECHNICAL PROGRESS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ), THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ONE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TREATY .   PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 73/, MEMBER STATES WERE OBLIGED TO PUT INTO FORCE THE MEASURES NEEDED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THAT DIRECTIVE WITHIN MONTHS OF ITS NOTIFICATION , THE PERIOD HAVING EXPIRED IN THIS CASE ON MAY . PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF COMMISSION DIRECTIVE NO 76/, MEMBER STATES WERE OBLIGED TO PUT INTO FORCE THE MEASURES NEEDED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THAT DIRECTIVE WITHIN NINE MONTHS OF ITS NOTIFICATION , THE PERIOD HAVING EXPIRED IN THIS CASE ON JANUARY .    THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DISPUTE THE FACT THAT IT HAS NOT SATISFIED THAT OBLIGATION . IT MERELY STATES THAT THE DELAY IN APPLYING THE DIRECTIVES IN QUESTION IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT ITS ATTEMPTS TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE SAID DIRECTIVES HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED OWING TO POLITICAL AND PARLIAMENTARY EVENTS . A DRAFT LAW WAS TABLED BEFORE THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT DURING THE     PREVIOUS SESSION BUT LAPSED OWING TO THE EARLY DISSOLUTION OF THAT PARLIAMENT . IN ORDER TO ADAPT THE INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM MORE RAPIDLY TO COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES , THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS SUBSEQUENTLY ASKED THE PARLIAMENT FOR THE DELEGATION OF LEGISLATIVE POWERS , AS PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF THE CONSTITUTION , IN ORDER THAT PROVISIONS HAVING THE FORCE AND STATUS OF LAW , WHICH WERE NECESSARY FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A BODY OF COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES INCLUDING THOSE IN QUESTION , MIGHT BE ADOPTED BY DECREE . SUCH DELEGATION WAS APPROVED BY THE SENATE ON JULY , BY THE ADOPTION OF AN APPROPRIATE DRAFT LAW , WHICH IS AT PRESENT UNDER EXAMINATION BY THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES .   THESE CIRCUMSTANCES DO NOT EXPUNGE THE FAILURE TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS , WITH WHICH THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC IS CHARGED . ACCORDING TO THE WELL-ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW , A MEMBER STATE MAY NOT PLEAD PROVISIONS , PRACTICES OR CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING IN ITS INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OBLIGATIONS AND TIME-LIMITS RESULTING FROM COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES .   IT MUST THEREFORE BE DECLARED THAT BY FAILING TO ADOPT , WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIODS , THE PROVISIONS NEEDED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 73/OF NOVEMBER AND COMMISSION DIRECTIVE NO 76/OF APRIL , THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ONE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY .  
Decision on costs
UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE , THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY SHALL BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .   SINCE THE DEFENDANT HAS FAILED IN ITS SUBMISSIONS , IT MUST BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .
