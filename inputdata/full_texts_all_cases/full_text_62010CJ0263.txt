Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Tribunalul Gorj – Registration of second-hand vehicles previously registered in other
                  Member States – Environmental tax on motor vehicles upon first registration in a Member State – Classification of the criterion
                  of ‘date of first registration’ – Whether the national legislation is compatible with Article TFEU – Whether exemption
                  from payment of the tax, introduced for certain categories of vehicle, is lawful – Possible application of the ‘polluter pays’
                  principle.
               
Operative part
Article TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a Member State from introducing a pollution tax levied on motor vehicles
         on their first registration in that Member State, if that tax is arranged in such a way as to discourage the putting into
         circulation in that Member State of second-hand vehicles purchased in other Member States but without discouraging the purchase
         of second-hand vehicles of the same age and condition on the domestic market.
