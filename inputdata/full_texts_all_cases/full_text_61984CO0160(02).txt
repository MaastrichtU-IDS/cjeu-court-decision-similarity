ARTICLE THE COURT SHALL DEFRAY THE EXPENSES OCCASIONED BY THE LETTERS ROGATORY WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE RIGHT TO CHARGE THEM , WHERE APPROPRIATE TO THE PARTIES ' ,   MAKES THE FOLLOWING      ORDER  . SUBJECT MATTER OF THE DISPUTE  ON AUGUST , THE APPLICANT UNDERTAKINGS , WISHING TO IMPORT CONSIGNMENTS OF RICE TOTALLING APPROXIMATELY TONNES FROM NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES , ASKED THE COMPETENT DEPARTMENT OF THE GREEK MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE WHAT THE RATE OF THE IMPORT LEVY WAS . THEY WERE TOLD THAT THAT DAY ' S RATE WAS DR PER TONNE AND THAT IT WAS A CONDITION OF CARRYING OUT THE IMPORT THAT THEY MUST LODGE AN APPLICATION TOGETHER WITH A BANK GUARANTEE SO AS TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO PREPARE THE IMPORT LICENCE REQUIRED FOR CUSTOMS CLEARANCE OF THE PRODUCT THEY WERE IMPORTING .  ON AUGUST , THE APPLICANTS SUBMITTED TWO APPLICATIONS TO THE COMPETENT GREEK AUTHORITY FOR TWO IMPORT LICENCES TO BE DRAWN UP AND THEY FURNISHED THE REQUIRED BANK GUARANTEES . THEIR CONTENTION , WHICH IS DENIED BY THE COMMISSION , IS THAT THEY DID NOT FILL IN BOX OF THE FORM , CONTAINING THE WORDS ' ADVANCE FIXING REQUESTED : YES/NO ' , BECAUSE THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANT . THEY SAY THAT THE OFFICIAL AT THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE WHOM THEY ASKED FOR CLARIFICATION DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE WORDS EITHER AND IN THE END COMPLETED THE FORM FOR THEM BY PUTTING A CROSS AGAINST ' NO ' .  ON AUGUST , THE RELEVANT DEPARTMENT OF THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE ISSUED TO THE APPLICANTS THE TWO IMPORT LICENCES ; THEIR EXPIRY DATE WAS OCTOBER , AND BOX OF EACH LICENCE INDICATED THAT ADVANCE FIXING OF THE IMPORT LEVY HAD NOT BEEN REQUESTED .  WHEN THE RICE WAS ACTUALLY IMPORTED , THE RELEVANT CUSTOMS OFFICE INFORMED THE  APPLICANTS THAT THE RATE OF IMPORT LEVY WAS NOT DR PER TONNE BUT DR PER TONNE SINCE THEY HAD SUBMITTED AN IMPORT LICENCE AND NOT AN ADVANCE-FIXING CERTIFICATE . IN VIEW OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THE APPLICANTS CONSIDERED IT PREFERABLE TO PLACE THE RICE UNDER THE CUSTOMS WAREHOUSING PROCEDURE IN ORDER FOR THE MATTER TO BE CLEARED UP BY THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE . THERE FOLLOWED AN ABUNDANT EXCHANGE OF CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN GREEK GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS AND THE APPLICANT UNDERTAKINGS , WHICH MADE VAIN REQUESTS TO THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE FOR AN ADVANCE-FIXING CERTIFICATE TO BE DRAWN UP SHOWING A RATE OF LEVY OF DR PER TONNE AND FOR THE RECTIFICATION OF THE ORIGINAL IMPORT LICENCES . DURING THAT TIME , THE RATE OF LEVY ROSE CONSTANTLY .  ON THE EXPIRY OF THE STATUTORY WAREHOUSING PERIOD OF TWO YEARS FROM WHEN THE RICE WAS PLACED IN THE WAREHOUSE , ON SEPTEMBER , THE APPLICANTS DECLARED IT FOR FREE CIRCULATION ; THE RATE OF IMPORT LEVY ON THAT DATE WAS DR 487.PER TONNE ( TIMES MORE THAN IT WAS IN AUGUST ).  THE APPLICANTS THEN APPLIED FOR THE REMISSION OF THE EXCESS OF THE LEVY OVER WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF THE RATE OF DR PER TONNE RULING ON AUGUST HAD BEEN APPLIED ( THAT IS , DR - = ), PLEADING IGNORANCE OF THE COMMUNITY PROVISIONS APPLICABLE IN GREECE AFTER JANUARY .   ON NOVEMBER , THE GREEK MINISTRY OF FINANCE SUBMITTED TO THE COMMISSION A REQUEST FOR THE REMISSION OF THE AMOUNT OF DR AND FOR THE ADOPTION OF A DECISION TO THAT EFFECT , PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1430/OF JULY ON THE REPAYMENT OR      REMISSION OF IMPORT OR EXPORT DUTIES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ) ( SEE ANNEX I TO THIS ORDER ), AMENDED BY COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1672/OF JUNE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ). IN ITS REQUEST , THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE INDICATED THAT THE CONDUCT OF THE UNDERTAKINGS IN QUESTION DID NOT INVOLVE ANY NEGLIGENCE OR DECEPTION AND THAT :    ' IT IS CLEAR THAT THE RELEVANT DEPARTMENT OF THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE DID NOT APPRECIATE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ORDINARY IMPORT LICENCE AND AN ADVANCE-FIXING CERTIFICATE ' .  ON FEBRUARY , A GROUP OF EXPERTS COMPOSED OF REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL THE MEMBER STATES HELD A MEETING WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE COMMITTEE ON DUTY-FREE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXAMINED THE APPLICANTS '  CASE . THE COMMITTEE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT GREECE ' S REQUEST FOR THE REMISSION OF IMPORT DUTIES WAS NOT JUSTIFIED .  ON THE BASIS OF THAT FINDING THE COMMISSION ADOPTED DECISION NO E ( ) OF APRIL . THE STATEMENT OF THE GROUNDS FOR THE DECISION INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE :    ' IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO TREAT THE TWO COMPANIES CONCERNED AS IF THEY HAD APPLIED FOR AND OBTAINED ADVANCE FIXING CERTIFICATES ; ... THE RATE OF THE IMPORT LEVY ON RICE FLUCTUATED CONSIDERABLY DURING THE PERIOD FROM AUGUST TO SEPTEMBER ; . . . IT IS NOT FOR THE COMMUNITY TO ASSUME THE COMMERCIAL RISK RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN THE RATE OF THE IMPORT LEVY WHILE THE RICE WAS HELD IN A CUSTOMS WAREHOUSE ;   . . . THE COMPANIES SHOWED THEMSELVES TO BE NEGLIGENT IN UNDERTAKING A TRANSACTION CONCERNING A FAIRLY LARGE QUANTITY OF RICE  WITHOUT OBTAINING ADEQUATE INFORMATION ABOUT THE LEGISLATION GOVERNING THE SYSTEM OF IMPORT AND EXPORT LICENCES AND ADVANCE FIXING CERTIFICATES FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS ; . . . THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IMPORT LICENCES AND ADVANCE FIXING CERTIFICATES IS IMMEDIATELY CLEAR FROM THE TEXT OF THE COMMUNITY REGULATIONS IN FORCE IN THIS MATTER . . . '  IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES , ON JUNE , THE APPLICANT UNDERTAKINGS BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR THE DECISION TO BE DECLARED VOID .  . THE DISPUTED FACTS  THE APPLICANTS MAINTAIN IN PARTICULAR THAT :    ( A ) THEY WERE MISLED BY THE OFFICIAL OF THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE WHO FILLED IN BOX OF THE FORM HIMSELF WITHOUT KNOWING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ORDINARY IMPORT LICENCE AND AN ADVANCE-FIXING CERTIFICATE ;   ( B)IF THEY DID IN FACT MAKE AN ERROR OF LAW BY CONFUSING AN ORDINARY IMPORT LICENCE WITH AN ADVANCE-FIXING CERTIFICATE , THAT ERROR WAS WHOLLY EXCUSABLE IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT , UP TO AUGUST , NO OTHER IMPORTATION OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS FROM A NON-MEMBER COUNTRY INTO GREECE HAD TAKEN PLACE ;   ( C)THE CASE AROSE IN THE VERY FIRST MONTHS OF GREECE ' S MEMBERSHIP OF THE EEC AND EVERYONE , INCLUDING THE OFFICIALS CONCERNED , WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH THE MEANING OR EVEN THE TEXT OF THE COMMUNITY REGULATIONS ;   ( D)AT THAT TIME THE REGULATIONS DEALING WITH THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR WERE NOT AVAILABLE IN GREEK AND , IN SO FAR AS COPIES OF PROVISIONS WERE AVAILABLE , THE OFFICIALS CONCERNED RELIED ON PROVISIONAL HANDWRITTEN TRANSLATIONS PREPARED FOR THEIR INTERNAL USE ;       ( E)THE WORDING IN GREEK OF THE RUBRIC ' ADVANCE FIXING REQUESTED '  CONTAINED IN BOX OF THE IMPORT LICENCE FORM WAS MEANINGLESS AND INCAPABLE OF BEING ANSWERED BY ' YES '  OR ' NO ' ;   ( F)THEY WERE PREVENTED FROM CONTINUING TO KEEP THE RICE IN CUSTOMS STORAGE AND COMPELLED TO CLEAR IT THROUGH CUSTOMS BY VIRTUE OF THE RELEVANT GREEK LEGISLATION ( DECISION SERIAL NO M 1025/OF OCTOBER OF THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS ).  THE COMMISSION CHALLENGES THOSE STATEMENTS .  . THE FACTS ON WHICH THE COURT SEEKS CLARIFICATION  . WHO FILLED IN BOX OF THE IMPORT LICENCE AT ISSUE AND IN WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES?   . WAS THE WORDING OF THE QUESTION RELATING TO BOX OF THE IMPORT LICENCE INTELLIGIBLE IN THE GREEK TRANSLATION?   . WERE THE GREEK OFFICIALS WHO WERE IN CONTACT WITH THE APPLICANT UNDERTAKINGS AT THE MATERIAL TIME AWARE OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ORDINARY IMPORT LICENCE AND AN ADVANCE-FIXING CERTIFICATE?   . IS IT THE CASE THAT UP TO AUGUST NO APPLICATION FOR THE IMPORTATION OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS FROM A NON-MEMBER COUNTRY HAD BEEN SUBMITTED SINCE JANUARY 1981?   . ON AUGUST , THE COMMUNITY REGULATIONS RELEVANT TO THIS DISPUTE AND IN PARTICULAR THE REGULATIONS LAYING DOWN DETAILED RULES FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE SYSTEM OF IMPORT AND EXPORT LICENCES AND ADVANCE-FIXING CERTIFICATES FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS WERE AS FOLLOWS :   COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1418/OF JUNE ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN RICE ;   COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1430/OF JULY ON THE REPAYMENT OR REMISSION OF IMPORT OR EXPORT DUTIES ;  COMMISSION REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1575/OF JUNE LAYING DOWN PROVISIONS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ARTICLE OF COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1430/;  COMMISSION REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 3183/OF DECEMBER LAYING DOWN COMMON DETAILED RULES FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE SYSTEM OF IMPORT AND EXPORT LICENCES AND ADVANCE FIXING CERTIFICATES FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS .  ON AUGUST :   HAD THOSE REGULATIONS BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES IN GREEK?   WERE THOSE OFFICIAL JOURNALS AVAILABLE TO THE GREEK OFFICIALS CONCERNED?   WERE THOSE OFFICIAL JOURNALS READILY AVAILABLE TO THE APPLICANT UNDERTAKINGS , REGARD BEING HAD TO THE SITUATION OF THEIR REGISTERED OFFICE?   . IS IT TRUE THAT THE APPLICANT UNDERTAKINGS WERE PROHIBITED BY THE GREEK AUTHORITIES FROM CONTINUING TO KEEP THE RICE IN CUSTOMS STORAGE ON THE EXPIRY OF A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS?   . SCOPE OF THE LETTERS ROGATORY ISSUED BY THE COURT  . IT IS APPROPRIATE TO ISSUE LETTERS ROGATORY FOR THE EXAMINATION , BY THE COMPETENT JUDICIAL AUTHORITY , OF THE FOLLOWING FOUR WITNESSES :   MR CHARALAMBOS BLANAS , HEAD OF DIVISION RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXTERNAL MARKET , MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE , ODOS MARINOU GEROULANOU , ATHENS ;       MISS ANNIE GEORGOPOULOU , LEGAL EXPERT , EXTERNAL MARKET DIVISION , MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE , ODOS ARITIS , PAGRATI , ATHENS ;  MR ANTHONY MAKRIYANNIS , HEAD OF DIVISION , FOURTH CUSTOMS DIVISION , MINISTRY OF FINANCE , ODOS KARAGEORGI SERVIAS , ATHENS ;  MR NIKOLAOS MANOUSSOPOULOS , AN OFFICIAL IN THE FOURTH CUSTOMS DIVISION , MINISTRY OF FINANCE , ODOS KARAGEORGI SERVIAS , ATHENS .   .
