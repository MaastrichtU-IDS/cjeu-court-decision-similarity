Summary
. According to settled case-law ( see, in particular, the judgment of July in Joined Cases and 58/Consten-Grundig v Commission (( )) ECR ), the absolute territorial protection granted to a distributor under an exclusive distribution agreement, designed to enable parallel imports to be controlled and hindered, leads to separate national markets being maintained artificially, contrary to the Treaty, and is therefore such as to infringe Article 85() thereof .  . It is not necessary for an undertaking to have been aware that it was infringing the competition rules in the Treaty for an infringement to be regarded as having been committed intentionally; it is sufficient that it could not have been unaware that the contested conduct had as its object the restriction of competition ( judgment of July in Case 246/Belasco v Commission (( )) ECR ).  . Article 15() of Regulation No contains no territorial limit in regard to the turnover of undertakings which have infringed the competition rules which is to be taken into account in determining the amount of the fine to be imposed on them, so that the Commission cannot be required to take account only of the total turnover realized on the market in which the infringement was committed .
