         an agreement pursuant to which training given in Greece by a private body is homologated by those authorities;

         authorities, of the answers to five questions previously sent to them by the Greek authorities; and
      
–        by allowing applicants for recognition of Italian opticians’ diplomas, who applied before the entry into force of Law 2916/on the structure of university or similar education and the regulation of questions on the technological sector of that education,
         no choice between an adaptation period and an aptitude test,

         Directive 92/51/EEC of June on a second general system for the recognition of professional education and training
