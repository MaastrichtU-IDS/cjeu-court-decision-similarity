Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE B ( D ) . OF THE SIXTH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 77/OF MAY ON THE HARMONIZATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO TURNOVER TAXES - COMMON SYSTEM OF VALUE-ADDED TAX : UNIFORM BASIS OF ASSESSMENT , 
Grounds
BY ORDER OF SEPTEMBER , WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON SEPTEMBER , THE FINANZGERICHT ( FINANCE COURT ) HAMBURG REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY A QUESTION ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE B ( D ) . OF THE SIXTH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 77/388/EEC OF MAY ON THE HARMONIZATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO TURNOVER TAXES - COMMON SYSTEM OF VALUE-ADDED TAX : UNIFORM BASIS OF ASSESSMENT ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ).       ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE THE MEMBER STATES HAS TO ADOPT THE NECESSARY LAWS , REGULATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS BY JANUARY AT THE LATEST . SINCE SEVERAL MEMBER STATES INCLUDING THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY WERE NOT IN A POSITION TO MAKE , IN GOOD TIME , THE NECESSARY ADAPTATIONS TO THEIR SYSTEM OF VALUE-ADDED TAX , THE COUNCIL , BY THE NINTH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 77/OF JUNE ON THE HARMONIZATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO TURNOVER TAXES , EXTENDED THE SAID PERIOD UNTIL JANUARY .    IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE ADOPTION OF THE LAW OF NOVEMBER ( BUNDESGESETZBLATT I , P . ), WHICH TOOK EFFECT ON JANUARY , THAT THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY IMPLEMENTED THE SIXTH DIRECTIVE .   IT IS APPARENT FROM THE ORDER MAKING THE REFERENCE THAT THE UNDERTAKING GRENDEL , WHICH CARRIES ON BUSINESS IN GERMANY AS A CREDIT NEGOTIATOR , WAS BY NOTICE OF ASSESSMENT OF SEPTEMBER ISSUED BY THE FINANZAMT FUR KORPERSCHAFTEN ( TAX OFFICE FOR CORPORATIONS ) IN HAMBURG , ASSESSED TO TURNOVER TAX ON THE INCOME RECEIVED IN BY WAY OF COMMISSION FOR THAT ACTIVITY , IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GERMAN LAW IN FORCE UNTIL DECEMBER .    THE UNDERTAKING OBJECTED AND CLAIMED EXEMPTION FORM THE TAX , RELYING ON ARTICLE OF THE SIXTH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE WHICH , IT ALLEGED , WAS DIRECTLY APPLICABLE . ARTICLE B ( D ) . THEREOF PROVIDES THAT ' ' THE GRANTING AND THE NEGOTIATION OF CREDIT ' '  AND ' ' THE MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT BY THE PERSON GRANTING IT ' '  ARE TO BE EXEMPT FROM TAX . THE FINANZAMT TOOK THE VIEW THAT THE DIRECTIVE DID NOT CREATE A RIGHT CAPABLE OF BEING ASSERTED DIRECTLY BY AN INDIVIDUAL AND REFUSED TO GRANT THE EXEMPTION .   THE FINANZGERICHT HAMBURG BEFORE WHICH THE MATTER WAS BROUGHT STAYED THE PROCEEDINGS AND REFERRED THE FOLLOWING QUESTION TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING :    ' ' IS ARTICLE B ( D ) . OF THE SIXTH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE OF MAY ( 77/388/EEC ) TO BE INTERPRETED AS CONFERRING ON A TAXABLE PERSON , AS FROM THE DATE ON WHICH IT TOOK EFFECT , A DIRECT LEGAL RIGHT TO EXEMPTION FROM TAX IN RESPECT OF THE TRANSACTIONS REFERRED TO THEREIN , EVEN WHERE EXEMPTION IS ( NOT YET ) PROVIDED FOR UNDER NATIONAL LAW ON TURNOVER TAX?  ' '       THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION DID NOT APPEAR IN THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COURT . ITS VIEW WAS SUPPORTED BY THE COMMISSION WHICH ARGUED BEFORE THE COURT TO THE EFFECT THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE ENTITLED TO CLAIM THE RELEVANT EXEMPTION FROM TAX . THE COUNCIL TOO , WHICH TOOK PART IN THE ORAL PROCEDURE , SUPPORTED THE PLAINTIFF ' S VIEW , ALBEIT WITH CERTAIN RESERVATIONS .   ON THE OTHER HAND THE FINANZAMT , SUPPORTED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE FRENCH AND ITALIAN REPUBLICS EXPOUNDED A NUMBER OF ARGUMENTS DESIGNED TO SHOW THAT FOR THE PERIOD , NAMELY THE TAX YEAR , DURING WHICH THE NATIONAL LEGAL PROVISIONS IMPLEMENTING THE DIRECTIVE IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY HAD NOT YET ENTERED INTO FORCE , IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO RELY ON THE PROVISION IN QUESTION .   IT MUST BE POINTED OUT THAT THE QUESTIONS RAISED IN THIS CASE HAVE ALREADY BEEN RESOLVED BY THE COURT IN ITS JUDGMENT OF JANUARY IN CASE 8/BECKER ( ) ECR , WHICH WAS CONCERNED WITH THE SAME ISSUE .   THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT AND THE COMMISSION HAVE CONFINED THEMSELVES TO REPEATING THEIR OBSERVATIONS IN CASE 8/. THE PARTIES WHO WERE NOT INVOLVED IN CASE 8/, NAMELY THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE DEFENDANT IN THE MAIN ACTION , HAVE NOT PUT FORWARD IN THEIR PLEADINGS NEW ARGUMENTS WHICH WERE NOT CONSIDERED IN THE ABOVE-MENTIONED JUDGMENT .   IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS NECESSARY TO REFER TO THE COURT ' S RULING IN ITS JUDGMENT OF JANUARY , NAMELY THAT AS FROM JANUARY IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THE PROVISION CONCERNING THE EXEMPTION FROM TURNOVER TAX OF TRANSACTIONS CONSISTING OF THE NEGOTIATION OF CREDIT CONTAINED IN ARTICLE OF DIRECTIVE 77/TO BE RELIED UPON , IN THE ABSENCE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT DIRECTIVE , BY A CREDIT NEGOTIATOR WHERE HE HAD REFRAINED FROM PASSING THAT TAX ON TO PERSONS FOLLOWING HIM IN THE CHAIN OF SUPPLY , AND THAT THE STATE COULD NOT CLAIM , AS AGAINST HIM , THAT IT HAD FAILED TO IMPLEMENT THE DIRECTIVE .   THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF JANUARY IN CASE 8/BECKER IS TO BE ANNEXED TO THE PRESENT JUDGMENT BY WAY OF SUPPLEMENT .
