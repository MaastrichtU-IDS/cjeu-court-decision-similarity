Re:
Reference for a preliminary ruling — Ufficio del Giudice di Pace di Venafro — Interpretation of Articles and of the Protocol
                  on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities (JO L 152, p. 13) — Member of the European Parliament charged
                  with the offence of insulting behaviour in consequence of his making false accusations against a representative of the forces
                  of order — Definition of expression of an opinion in the performance of parliamentary duties.
               
Operative part
On a proper construction of Article of the Protocol on the privileges and immunities of the European Union, annexed to the
         EU, FEU and EAEC Treaties, a statement made by a Member of the European Parliament beyond the precincts of that institution
         and giving rise to prosecution in his Member State of origin for the offence of insulting behaviour, does not constitute an
         opinion expressed in the performance of his parliamentary duties covered by the immunity afforded by that provision unless
         that statement amounts to a subjective appraisal having a direct, obvious connection with the performance of those duties.
         It is for the court making the reference to determine whether those conditions have been satisfied in the case in the main
         proceedings.
