Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Sozialgericht Würzburg – Interpretation of Article 71(1)(b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/of the Council of June on the application of social security schemes to employed persons and their families moving
                  within the Community (OJ, English Special Edition (II), p. 416) – Calculation of the unemployment benefits of a boatman
                  on the Rhine (‘Rheinschiffer’) who was resident, during his last period of employment, on the territory of a Member State
                  other than the State of employment and returned, in accordance with his contract of employment, only every second week to
                  his place of residence – Classification of that worker as ‘a frontier worker’ or ‘a worker, other than a frontier worker’.
               
Operative part: 
The reference for a preliminary ruling made by the Sozialgericht Würzburg by decision of September is manifestly inadmissible.
