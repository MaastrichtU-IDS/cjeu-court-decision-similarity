++++EEC Treaty - Article - Scope - Use of Article to regulate, under temporary importation arrangements which can be established on the the basis of other provisions of the Treaty, the use of containers in internal traffic - Unlawful  ( EEC Treaty, Art . 235; Council Regulation No 2096/)  
Summary
It follows from the very wording of Article that its use as a legal basis for a measure is justified only if no other provision of the Treaty gives the Community institutions the necessary power to adopt that measure ( see judgment of March in Case 45/(( )) ECR ).  No such justification is available since it involves the insertion into a regulation introducing temporary importation arrangements for containers and capable of adoption on the basis of Articles and of the Treaty of a provision regulating the use of such containers in internal traffic . In fact it is sufficient to establish that that legislation is an essential part of the arrangements for the temporary importation of containers and cannot be divorced from it having regard to the basis for its adoption .
