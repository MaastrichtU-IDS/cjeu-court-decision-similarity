EXPENSES NECESSARILY INCURRED BY THE PARTIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS , IN PARTICULAR THE TRAVEL AND SUBSISTENCE EXPENSES AND THE REMUNERATION OF AGENTS , ADVISERS OR LAWYERS .

REGARD BEING HAD TO THE NEW AND IMPORTANT QUESTIONS OF COMMUNITY LAW RAISED IN THESE CASES AND TO THEIR FINANCIAL IMPORTANCE AND THE CONSIDERABLE EXTENT OF THE LAWYERS '  WORK AND THE NUMBER AND DIVERSITY OF THE PROCEDURAL STEPS WHICH IT HAS BEEN NECESSARY TO TAKE , IT IS APPROPRIATE IN THIS INSTANCE TO FIX THE RECOVERABLE COSTS AT THE TOTAL SUM OF FF , IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE APPLICANTS HAVE NOT SUBMITTED A SEPARATE CLAIM FOR , INTER ALIA , THE TRAVELLING EXPENSES OF THEIR LAWYERS .
