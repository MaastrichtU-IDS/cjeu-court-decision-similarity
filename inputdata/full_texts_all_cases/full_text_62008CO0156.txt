                  Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment (OJ L 145, p. 1) and of Article of Council Directive
                  2006/112/EC of November on the common system of value added tax (OJ L 347, p. 1) – Account taken, for the purposes
                  of determining the basis of assessment of real property transfer tax (‘Grunderwerbsteuer’), of future building work subject
                  to turnover tax if the purchase includes both the supply of the building plot and the building work.
               
Operative part 
 
	Article of Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of May on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating
                     to turnover taxes – Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment, as amended by Council Directive 91/680/EEC
                     of December 1991, must be interpreted as not precluding a Member State, on the transfer of a plot of land not yet built
                     on, from including future building work in the taxable amount used for the assessment of taxes on transfers and transactions
                     – such as the ‘Grunderwerbsteuer’ provided for under German law – and thereby making a transaction that is subject to value
                     added tax under that directive subject also to those other taxes, provided that the latter cannot be characterised as turnover
                     taxes.
