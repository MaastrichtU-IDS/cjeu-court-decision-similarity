Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY BY NOT ADOPTING WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE MEASURES NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 78/660/EEC OF JULY ON THE ANNUAL ACCOUNTS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF COMPANIES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ), 
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JANUARY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT PROCEEDINGS UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY TO OBTAIN A DECLARATION THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THAT TREATY BY NOT ADOPTING WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE MEASURES NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 78/OF JULY ON THE ANNUAL ACCOUNTS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF COMPANIES ( THE FOURTH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE ).  THE FOURTH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE , WHICH WAS BASED ON ARTICLE ( ) ( G ) OF THE TREATY , CONTAINS MEASURES TO COORDINATE NATIONAL PROVISIONS CONCERNING THE PRESENTATION AND CONTENT OF ANNUAL ACCOUNTS AND ANNUAL REPORTS , THE VALUATION METHOD USED THEREIN AND THEIR PUBLICATION IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN COMPANIES WITH LIMITED LIABILITY . THERE WAS AN URGENT NEED FOR SUCH COORDINATING MEASURES , AS IS STATED IN THE SECOND RECITAL IN THE PREAMBLE TO THE DIRECTIVE , BECAUSE THE ACTIVITIES OF SUCH COMPANIES FREQUENTLY EXTEND BEYOND THE FRONTIERS OF THEIR NATIONAL TERRITORIES AND THEY OFFER NO SAFEGUARDS TO THIRD PARTIES BEYOND THE AMOUNTS OF THEIR NET ASSETS .  ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE PROVIDES THAT THE MEMBER STATES SHALL BRING INTO FORCE THE LAWS , REGULATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS NECESSARY FOR THEM TO COMPLY WITH THE DIRECTIVE WITHIN TWO YEARS OF ITS NOTIFICATION AND THAT THEY ARE TO INFORM THE COMMISSION THEREOF . THE DIRECTIVE WAS NOTIFIED ON JULY , SO THAT THAT PERIOD EXPIRED TWO YEARS THEREAFTER .  THE COMMISSION RECEIVED NO COMMUNICATION ON THE SUBJECT FROM THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT AND THEREFORE INITIATED THE PROCEDURE UNDER ARTICLE . NEITHER ITS LETTER OF OCTOBER CALLING UPON THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT TO ACT NOR THE REASONED OPINION ISSUED ON JUNE ELICITED A RESPONSE FROM THE ITALIAN AUTHORITIES . ACCORDINGLY , THE COMMISSION BROUGHT THIS APPLICATION ON JANUARY .   THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT CONCEDES THAT IT HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS BUT SUBMITS THAT THE SUBJECT-MATTER IS A COMPLEX ONE WHICH WILL ENTAIL AN AMENDMENT TO ITS CIVIL CODE . IT CLAIMS THAT DRAFT LEGISLATION TO IMPLEMENT THE DIRECTIVE IN QUESTION IS AT AN ADVANCED STAGE OF CONSIDERATION AND IT HOPES THAT THE DRAFT WILL BE ADOPTED WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME . AT THE HEARING IT STATED THAT THAT COULD BE DONE FAIRLY SOON , BUT IT COULD NOT BE SURE PRECISELY WHEN THE PROBLEM WOULD FINALLY BE RESOLVED .  THE COURT WOULD POINT OUT THAT IT HAS CONSISTENTLY HELD THAT MEMBER STATES MAY NOT PLEAD PROVISIONS , PRACTICES OR CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING IN THEIR INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OBLIGATIONS AND TIME-LIMITS LAID DOWN IN DIRECTIVES .  ACCORDINGLY , THE COURT FINDS THAT BY FAILING TO ADOPT , OR INFORM THE COMMISSION OF , THE MEASURES REFERRED TO IN COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 78/660/EEC OF JULY WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY .  
Decision on costs
COSTS ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE PROVIDES THAT THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY SHALL BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS . SINCE THE DEFENDANT HAS BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL IN ITS ARGUMENTS IT MUST BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .  
Operative part

( 2)THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC IS ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .
