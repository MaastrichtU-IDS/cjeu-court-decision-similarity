SCHOCKWEILER, PRESIDENT OF CHAMBER, G . BOSCO AND R . JOLIET, JUDGES,  ADVOCATE GENERAL : C . O . LENZ  REGISTRAR : D . LOUTERMAN, ADMINISTRATOR  HAVING REGARD TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING AND FURTHER TO THE HEARING ON MARCH 1987,  AFTER HEARING THE OPINION OF THE ADVOCATE GENERAL DELIVERED AT THE SITTING ON MAY 1987,  GIVES THE FOLLOWING  JUDGMENT  
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON FEBRUARY MARCEL GRUMBACH, AN OFFICIAL OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION OF MARCH BY WHICH THE COMMISSION REJECTED HIS REQUEST FOR A DIFFERENTIAL ALLOWANCE SUBMITTED ON FEBRUARY ON THE GROUND THAT FROM FEBRUARY TO MAY 1983, AS A MEMBER OF THE COMMISSION' S DELEGATION IN GENEVA, HE HAD TEMPORARILY PERFORMED THE DUTIES OF A HEAD OF DIVISION OR AN ADVISER IN GRADE A*.  FOR THE SAKE OF A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTS OF THE CASE, IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT ON SEPTEMBER MR GRUMBACH SUBMITTED A COMPLAINT AGAINST THE DECISION OF JUNE BY WHICH THE COMMISSION HAD REJECTED HIS REQUEST FOR CLASSIFICATION IN GRADE A*BY REASON OF THE DUTIES WHICH HE HAD PERFORMED IN GENEVA . THAT  COMPLAINT WAS REJECTED BY DECISION OF JANUARY 1984, AGAINST WHICH MR GRUMBACH DID NOT APPEAL .  IT WAS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THAT DECISION THAT THE COMMISSION DID NOT SHARE THE APPLICANT' S OPINION THAT THE DUTIES WHICH HE HAD PERFORMED IN GENEVA CORRESPONDED TO THE DUTIES OF AN OFFICIAL IN GRADE A*. THE DECISION ALSO POINTED OUT THAT EVEN IF AN OFFICIAL PERFORMS DUTIES ATTACHING TO A GRADE ABOVE HIS OWN, WHICH MR GRUMBACH HAD NOT, HE DOES NOT THEREBY ACQUIRE A RIGHT TO BE RECLASSIFIED .  ALTHOUGH THE COMMISSION HAS NOT FORMALLY OBJECTED TO THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION, IT HAS STRESSED THAT IN HIS REQUEST OF FEBRUARY MR GRUMBACH MERELY REPRODUCED THE ARGUMENTS ALREADY PUT FORWARD IN HIS COMPLAINT OF SEPTEMBER CONCERNING THE NATURE OF THE DUTIES PERFORMED AND THAT THE DECISION REJECTING THAT REQUEST REFERRED TO THE COMMISSION' S DECISION OF JANUARY ON THAT COMPLAINT . IT HAS ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE COMPLAINT SUBMITTED BY MR GRUMBACH ON JUNE WAS REJECTED BY DECISION OF DECEMBER WHICH WAS EXPRESSLY STATED BY THE COMMISSION TO BE "MERELY CONFIRMATION OF THE DECISION OF JANUARY ". IT CONCLUDES THAT THE ISSUE IS THE SAME IN THE TWO PROCEDURES, WHICH IS A DECISIVE FACTOR IN ASSESSING THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION .  MR GRUMBACH CLAIMS IN THIS REGARD THAT THE ONLY RELEVANT FACTOR FOR PURPOSES OF THE ADMISSIBILITY OF AN ACTION IS ITS OBJECT, AND THE FACTS ON WHICH THE PROCEEDINGS ARE BASED ARE IRRELEVANT . AS REGARDS THE TIME-LIMITS WHICH MUST BE COMPLIED WITH, HE CONSIDERS THAT NO LIMIT IS FIXED BY THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS FOR SUBMITTING A REQUEST UNDER ARTICLE 90*().  BY DECISION OF FEBRUARY 1987, THE COURT ( FIRST CHAMBER ) DECIDED THAT THE HEARING WOULD BE CONFINED TO CONSIDERATION OF THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE ACTION .  AS REGARDS THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE ACTION, IT SHOULD BE STATED THAT IN SO FAR AS THE DECISION OF JANUARY EXPRESSLY REFUSES TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE APPLICANT HAD PERFORMED DUTIES ATTACHING TO A POST HIGHER THAN HIS GRADE, IT ALSO CONSTITUTES AN IMPLIED DECISION NOT TO APPLY TO HIM THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS ON THE GRANTING OF A DIFFERENTIAL ALLOWANCE FOR A TEMPORARY POSTING .  CONSEQUENTLY, THE APPLICANT OUGHT TO HAVE COMMENCED PROCEEDINGS CHALLENGING THE DECISION OF JANUARY WITHIN THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD PRESCRIBED IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS . THE ACTION BROUGHT ON FEBRUARY IS THEREFORE MANIFESTLY OUT OF TIME .  THE DECISION OF MARCH CONTAINS NO NEW FACTORS UPON WHICH MR GRUMBACH COULD RELY IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THAT HIS APPLICATION IS ADMISSIBLE . THAT DECISION IS BASED EXCLUSIVELY ON "ALL THE REASONS" SET OUT IN THE COMMISSION' S REPLY TO HIM OF JANUARY .  IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, THE APPLICATION MUST BE DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS . HOWEVER, UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE INSTITUTIONS ARE TO BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS IN PROCEEDINGS INSTITUTED BY SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES .  
Operative part
On those grounds,  THE COURT ( First Chamber )  hereby :  ( ) Dismisses the application as inadmissible;  ( ) Orders the parties to pay their own costs .
