Appeal: against the judgment of the Court of First Instance (Fifth Chamber) in Case T-416/Angelidis v Parliament [2006] ECR-SC I-A-2-and II-A-2-1607, in which the Court rejected the applicant’s application, first, for the annulment
         of his staff report for the period from January to December and, second, for compensation for the harm he suffered
         by reason both of alleged irregularities in the disputed staff report and of its allegedly late establishment.
      
Held: The appeal is dismissed. Mr Angelidis is ordered to bear his own costs and to pay those of the European Parliament.
