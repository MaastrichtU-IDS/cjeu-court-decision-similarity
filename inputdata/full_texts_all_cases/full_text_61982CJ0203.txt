Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT , BY FAILING TO COMPLY WITH THE TIME-LIMITS FIXED BY COMMISSION DECISION 80/932/EEC OF SEPTEMBER CONCERNING THE PARTIAL TAKING OVER BY THE STATE OF EMPLOYERS '  CONTRIBUTIONS TO SICKNESS INSURANCE SCHEMES IN ITALY , THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ONE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON AUGUST , THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION PURSUANT TO THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAD FAILED TO FULFIL ONE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY BY NOT COMPLYING WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD WITH COMMISSION DECISION 80/932/EEC OF SEPTEMBER CONCERNING THE     PARTIAL TAKING OVER BY THE STATE OF EMPLOYERS '  CONTRIBUTIONS TO SICKNESS INSURANCE SCHEMES IN ITALY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ).   BY DECREE LAW NO OF JULY ( GAZZETTA UFFICIALE NO ), CONVERTED INTO LAW NO OF AUGUST ( GAZZETTA UFFICIALE NO ), THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED A PARTIAL TAKING OVER BY THE STATE OF THE EMPLOYERS '  CONTRIBUTIONS WHICH INDUSTRIAL UNDERTAKINGS AND CERTAIN UNDERTAKINGS IN THE SERVICES SECTOR HAVE TO PAY ON BEHALF OF THEIR EMPLOYEES FOR SICKNESS INSURANCE . THAT TAKING OVER BY THE STATE , WHICH WAS INITIALLY LAID DOWN FOR A TRANSITIONAL PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS , WAS SUBSEQUENTLY EXTENDED SEVERAL TIMES AND MADE DEFINITIVE BY DECREE LAW NO OF DECEMBER ( GAZZETTA UFFICIALE NO ).   THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED DECREE LAW NO PROVIDES THAT :    ' ' WITH EFFECT FROM THE CONTRIBUTION PERIOD FOLLOWING THE ONE APPLYING ON DECEMBER , THE TOTAL LEVELS OF CONTRIBUTIONS FOR COMPULSORY SICKNESS INSURANCE PAYABLE BY UNDERTAKINGS . . . ARE REDUCED BY FOUR PERCENTAGE POINTS FOR MALE EMPLOYEES AND BY TEN PERCENTAGE POINTS FOR FEMALE EMPLOYEES . ' '   THE COMMISSION CONSIDERED THAT SUCH A SYSTEM CONSTITUTED AN AID INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE COMMON MARKET WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY , SINCE THAT TAKING OVER BY THE STATE ENTAILED A GREATER REDUCTION IN EMPLOYERS '  CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SICKNESS INSURANCE SCHEME FOR FEMALE EMPLOYEES THAN FOR MALE EMPLOYEES THEREBY FAVOURING CERTAIN ITALIAN INDUSTRIES EMPLOYING LARGE NUMBERS OF FEMALE EMPLOYEES , SUCH AS , IN PARTICULAR , THOSE IN THE TEXTILE , CLOTHING , FOOTWEAR AND LEATHER-GOODS SECTOR . CONSEQUENTLY , ON SEPTEMBER IT ADOPTED A DECISION ( NOTIFIED TO THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT ON SEPTEMBER ) WHICH PROVIDES IN PARTICULAR :    ' ' ARTICLE THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC SHALL WITHIN SIX MONTHS REMOVE THE DIFFERENCE PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF DECREE NO OF DECEMBER IN THE RATE OF REDUCTION OF EMPLOYERS '  SICKNESS INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS AS BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE EMPLOYEES .      ARTICLE THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC SHALL COMMUNICATE TO THE COMMISSION THE LAWS , REGULATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS ADOPTED TO COMPLY WITH THIS DECISION NOT LATER THAN THE END OF THE PERIOD LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE . ' '   THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DISPUTE THAT DECISION . ON THE CONTRARY , BY A LETTER OF FEBRUARY , IT NOTIFIED THE COMMISSION THAT IT HAD TAKEN COGNIZANCE OF THE DECISION AND INTENDED TO COMPLY WITH IT WHEN THE PROVISIONS GOVERNING CONTRIBUTIONS FOR MEDICAL CARE WERE AMENDED .   BY LETTER OF MAY , THE COMMISSION , EXCEPTIONALLY , AUTHORIZED THE EXTENSION UNTIL JUNE OF THE PERIOD FOR COMPLYING WITH THE DECISION , ' ' ON THE CLEAR UNDERSTANDING THAT FROM THAT DATE ANY DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN IN THE LEVEL OF THE SAID REDUCTION WILL BE DEFINITIVELY ABOLISHED ' ' .   BY A SERIES OF DECREE LAWS , LATER CONVERTED INTO LAWS , AND IN THE LAST INSTANCE BY DECREE LAW NO OF JANUARY , CONVERTED INTO LAW NO OF MARCH , ITALY SET BACK REPEATEDLY THE EFFECTIVE EXPIRY DATE OF THE DISPUTED MEASURE . ACCORDING TO THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT THAT EXTENSION WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE OF ITS INTENTION TO REORGANIZE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM .   THE EXPLANATIONS PROVIDED BY THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT DO NOT AFFECT IN THE SLIGHTEST THE FACT THAT THE DISPUTED AID HAS , CONTRARY TO THE COMMISSION DECISION , REMAINED IN FORCE AFTER JUNE AND EVEN UP TO THE DATE OF THE ORAL PROCEDURE BEFORE THE COURT .   IT MUST THEREFORE BE HELD THAT BY FAILING TO COMPLY WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD WITH COMMISSION DECISION 80/932/EEC OF SEPTEMBER CONCERNING THE PARTIAL TAKING OVER BY THE STATE OF EMPLOYERS '  CONTRIBUTIONS TO SICKNESS INSURANCE SCHEMES IN ITALY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY .  
Decision on costs
