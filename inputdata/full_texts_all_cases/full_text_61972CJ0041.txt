Subject of the case
ON THE VALIDITY OF THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EEC OF DECEMBER ( OJ AGRICULTURAL SUPPLEMENT NO 7/OF DECEMBER 1965, PAGES 1612/AND 1625/65, TABLE B ), 
Grounds
BY ORDER DATED JUNE 1972, RECEIVED AT THE REGISTRY ON JULY 1972, THE HESSISCHES FINANZGERICHT REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING THE QUESTION OF THE VALIDITY OF THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EEC OF DECEMBER ( OJ, AGRICULTURAL SUPPLEMENT NO 7/OF DECEMBER 1965, PAGES AND 1625, TABLE B ) BY WHICH IT FIXED THE FREE-AT-FRONTIER PRICE FOR IMPORTS OF MAIZE FROM ITALY TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY AT LIRE PER METRIC TON AS FROM DECEMBER .  IT CAN BE SEEN FROM THE STATEMENT OF REASONS IN THE ORDER REFERRING THE MATTER THAT THE APPLICANT IN THE MAIN ACTION ALLEGES THAT THE DECISION IN QUESTION IS ILLEGAL BECAUSE THE COMMISSION BASED ITS CALCULATIONS FOR DETERMINING THE FREE-AT-FRONTIER PRICE OF MAIZE FROM ITALY NOT ON THE MOST FAVOURABLE PRICE FOR MAIZE GROWN IN ITALY, AS LAID DOWN BY ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO OF THE COMMISSION, BUT ON THE MOST FAVOURABLE PRICE FOR MAIZE IMPORTED FROM THE UNITED STATES .  HOWEVER, IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THE COURSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS THAT IN DETERMINING FREE-AT-FRONTIER PRICES THE COMMISSION, UNTIL DECEMBER 1965, BASED ITS CALCULATIONS EXCLUSIVELY ON THE MOST FAVOURABLE PRICES FOR MAIZE HARVESTED IN ITALY .  THEREFORE, THE GROUND OF COMPLAINT OF THE APPLICANT IN THE MAIN ACTION AGAINST THE DECISION IN QUESTION IS WITHOUT FOUNDATION .  EXAMINATION OF THE PROCEDURE FOLLOWED BY THE COMMISSION IN PREPARING THE DECISION IN QUESTION DOES NOT REVEAL ANY OTHER MATTER CAPABLE OF AFFECTING ITS VALIDITY .  THE QUESTION SHOULD THEREFORE BE ANSWERED IN THIS MANNER .  
Decision on costs
THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, WHICH HAS SUBMITTED OBSERVATIONS TO THE COURT, ARE NOT RECOVERABLE, AND AS THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE, INSOFAR AS THE PARTIES TO THE MAIN ACTION ARE CONCERNED, IN THE NATURE OF A STEP IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE A NATIONAL COURT, THE DECISION ON COSTS IS A MATTER FOR THAT COURT . 
Operative part
THE COURT  IN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION REFERRED TO IT BY THE HESSISCHES FINANZGERICHT BY ORDER OF THAT COURT DATED JUNE 1972, HEREBY RULES :  EXAMINATION OF THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF DECEMBER DETERMINING THE FREE-AT-FRONTIER PRICE FOR THE IMPORT OF MAIZE FROM ITALY TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY HAS NOT REVEALED ANY MATTER CAPABLE OF AFFECTING ITS VALIDITY .
