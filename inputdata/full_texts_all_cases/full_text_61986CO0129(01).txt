DECISION  
Grounds
ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE PROVIDES THAT THE REMAINDER OF THE PROCEEDINGS ON THE OBJECTION IS TO BE ORAL, UNLESS THE COURT DECIDES OTHERWISE . THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT IT HAS SUFFICIENT INFORMATION IN THIS CASE AND THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO OPEN THE ORAL PROCEDURE .  THE CONCLUSIONS IN THE APPLICATION ARE DIRECTED EXPRESSLY AND EXCLUSIVELY TO COUNCIL DECISION NO 86/OF MARCH .  THE COURT FURTHER OBSERVES THAT THE COMMISSION' S ROLE IS PART OF THE COUNCIL' S DECISION-MAKING PROCESS . IT IS CLEAR FROM THE PROVISIONS OF COUNCIL REGULATION NO 2176/OF JULY ON PROTECTION AGAINST DUMPED OR SUBSIDIZED IMPORTS FROM COUNTRIES NOT MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL 1984, L 201, P . ), ON THE BASIS OF WHICH THE DECISION AT ISSUE WAS ADOPTED, THAT THE COMMISSION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS AND DECIDING UPON THE BASIS OF THOSE INVESTIGATIONS WHETHER ANY PROTECTIVE MEASURE APPEARS NECESSARY AND TO CONCLUDE THE PROCEEDING . HOWEVER, IF, AS IN THIS CASE, OBJECTIONS TO THE TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING ARE RAISED BEFORE THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE ( ), ARTICLE REQUIRES THE COMMISSION TO SUBMIT TO THE COUNCIL A PROPOSAL THAT THE PROCEEDING BE TERMINATED . THE DECISION-MAKING POWER THEREFORE LIES WITH THE COUNCIL WHICH MAY TAKE A DECISION DIFFERENT FROM THAT PROPOSED BY THE COMMISSION .  IT FOLLOWS FROM THE FOREGOING THAT THE APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT DECISION NO 86/IS VOID IS INADMISSIBLE IN SO FAR AS IT IS DIRECTED AGAINST THE COMMISSION .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS,  THE COURT  HEREBY ORDERS AS FOLLOWS :  ( ) THE APPLICATION IS DISMISSED IN SO FAR AS IT IS DIRECTED AGAINST THE COMMISSION;  ( ) THE APPLICANT IS ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS RELATING TO THE OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY RAISED PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE .  LUXEMBOURG, MARCH .
