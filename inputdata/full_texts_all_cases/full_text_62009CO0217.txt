(Case C‑217/09)
Article 104(3, first subparagraph, of the Rules of Procedure – Article TFEU – Freedom of establishment – Public health – Pharmacies – Proximity – Supply of the population with medicines – Authorisation to operate – Territorial distribution of pharmacies – Establishment of limits based on a criterion of demographic density – Minimum distance between pharmacies

         (Art. TFEU) (see paras 33-34, operative part and 2)
      
Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Tribunale Amministrativo Regionale per il Piemonte – Interpretation of Arts 43, and
                  EC – Opening of new pharmacies – National legislation making authorisation for the moving of a pharmacy subject to the
                  keeping of a minimum distance between one pharmacy and another.
               
Operative part 
1.
	Article TFEU must be interpreted as not, in principle, precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main
                     proceedings, which places limits on the setting up of pharmacies by providing that:
                  
–        in each pharmaceutical area, only one pharmacy may be created, in principle, per or inhabitants; and
–        each pharmacy must keep a minimum distance from pre-existing pharmacies, that distance being, as a general rule, metres.
         
      
2.
	However, Article TFEU precludes such national legislation in so far as the basic rules of or inhabitants and
                     metres prevent the creation, in any geographical area with particular demographic characteristics, of a sufficient number
                     of pharmacies capable of providing an appropriate pharmaceutical service, which it is for the national court to verify.
