Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC , BY FAILING TO PUT INTO FORCE WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE LAWS , REGULATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 75/410/EEC OF JUNE ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO CONTINUOUS TOTALIZING WEIGHING MACHINES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ), HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY , 
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JUNE , THE COMMISSION APPLIED TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAD FAILED TO FULFIL AN OBLIGATION UNDER THE TREATY BY FAILING TO ADOPT , WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD , THE PROVISIONS NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 75/OF JUNE ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO CONTINUOUS TOTALIZING WEIGHING-MACHINES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ).   ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE , MEMBER STATES WERE REQUIRED TO PUT INTO FORCE THE MEASURES NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH IT WITHIN MONTHS OF ITS NOTIFICATION ; THE PERIOD EXPIRED IN THIS CASE ON DECEMBER .    THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DENY THE ALLEGED OMISSION . IT CONFINES ITSELF TO STATING THAT THE DELAY IN APPLYING THE DIRECTIVE IN QUESTION AROSE FROM THE FACT THAT ITS EFFORTS TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE SAID DIRECTIVE WERE UNSUCCESSFUL OWING TO POLITICAL AND PARLIAMENTARY EVENTS . THE DECREE-LAW MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMPLEMENTING THE DIRECTIVE , WHICH ENTERED INTO FORCE ON APRIL , HAD NOT BEEN ADOPTED INTO LAW BY THE CHAMBERS WITHIN THE PERIODS PROVIDED BY THE CONSTITUTION AND CEASED IN FACT TO HAVE EFFECT ; THE TWO DRAFT LAWS CONTAINED IN THE DECREE-LAW , WHICH HAD BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE SENATE , WERE NOT ADOPTED BECAUSE OF THE PREMATURE DISSOLUTION OF THE CHAMBERS .   IT SHOULD BE RECALLED THAT A MEMBER STATE MAY NOT PLEAD PROVISIONS , PRACTICES OR CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING IN ITS INTERNAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OBLIGATIONS AND TIME-LIMITS UNDER COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES .   IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO DECLARE THAT BY FAILING TO ADOPT , WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 75/OF JUNE , THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL AN OBLIGATION UNDER THE TREATY .  
Decision on costs
