Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION OF THE SELECTION COMMITTEE OF JULY NOT TO ACCEPT THE APPLICANT ' S CANDIDATURE FOR THE POST OF HEAD OF THE GREEK LANGUAGE DIVISION IN THE DIRECTORATE-GENERAL FOR INFORMATION AND PUBLIC RELATIONS , IN CHARGE OF THE ATHENS INFORMATION OFFICE , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON DECEMBER , CONSTANTIN VERROS , PRESS ATTACHE AT THE GREEK EMBASSY IN BRUSSELS , BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION OF THE SELECTION COMMITTEE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT OF AUGUST REFUSING TO CONSIDER HIS CANDIDATURE FOR THE POST OF HEAD OF THE GREEK LANGUAGE DIVISION OF THE DIRECTORATE-GENERAL FOR INFORMATION AND PUBLIC RELATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT , IN     CHARGE OF THE ATHENS INFORMATION OFFICE , AND , IN ADDITION , FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE APPOINTMENT OF THE SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATE , WHICH TOOK EFFECT ON JANUARY .  BY VACANCY NOTICE PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF JUNE , THE PARLIAMENT ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION OF RECRUITING A HEAD OF THE GREEK LANGUAGE DIVISION IN CHARGE OF THE ATHENS INFORMATION OFFICE .   THE VACANCY NOTICE INCLUDED A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DUTIES OF HEAD OF DIVISION AND THE CONDITIONS OF ELIGIBILITY FOR THE VACANT POST . IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE LEGAL BASIS FOR THE PROCEDURE ADOPTED WAS NOT INDICATED AND NO MENTION WAS MADE OF ANY AGE-LIMIT .   IN THE COURSE OF ITS OPENING MEETING , THE SELECTION COMMITTEE FIXED THE CRITERIA FOR THE SELECTION OF THE CANDIDATES AND DECIDED , IN PARTICULAR , THAT CANDIDATES MUST BE ' ' BETWEEN AND YEARS OF AGE ( IN OTHER WORDS HAVE BEEN BORN BETWEEN AUGUST AND AUGUST ) ' ' .   THE APPLICANT , WHO WAS BORN ON APRIL , SUBMITTED HIS CANDIDATURE TOGETHER WITH OTHER CANDIDATES . AS A RESULT OF THE AGE-LIMIT IMPOSED , THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SELECTION COMMITTEE NOTIFIED THE APPLICANT BY LETTER OF AUGUST THAT IT HAD DECIDED THAT HIS CANDIDATURE WAS UNACCEPTABLE .   THE APPLICANT SUBMITTED A COMPLAINT AGAINST THAT DECISION UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , WHICH WAS REJECTED . THE APPLICANT THEN BROUGHT THIS ACTION .   IN SUPPORT OF HIS ACTION , THE APPLICANT RELIES ON THREE SUBMISSIONS , THE FIRST OF WHICH ALLEGES AN INFRINGEMENT OF THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF ANNEX III TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS ON THE GROUND THAT THE SELECTION COMMITTEE HAD ADDED THE CONDITION AS TO AGE TO THE CONDITIONS SET OUT IN THE VACANCY NOTICE .     THE SECOND SUBMISSION ALLEGES AN INFRINGEMENT OF ARTICLE ( ) ( G ) OF ANNEX III TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE AGE-LIMIT WAS NOT LISTED AS A CONDITION FOR POSSIBLE ADMISSION IN THE VACANCY NOTICE ISSUED BY THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PARLIAMENT . THE THIRD SUBMISSION ALLEGES AN INFRINGEMENT OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , ON THE GROUND THAT THE SUBSTANTIVE CONDITIONS FOR THE APPLICATION OF THAT ARTICLE WERE LACKING .  ADMISSIBILITY OF THE SECOND AND THIRD SUBMISSIONS   THE PARLIAMENT CONTENDS THAT THE SECOND AND THIRD SUBMISSIONS WHICH WERE FORMULATED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE REPLY MUST BE REGARDED AS FRESH ISSUES AND CANNOT THEREFORE BE CONSIDERED BY THE COURT .   ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COURT PROVIDES THAT NO FRESH ISSUE MAY BE RAISED IN THE COURSE OF PROCEEDINGS UNLESS IT IS BASED ON MATTERS OF LAW OR OF FACT WHICH COME TO LIGHT IN THE COURSE OF THE WRITTEN PROCEDURE . HOWEVER , THE COURT OBSERVED IN ITS JUDGMENT OF SEPTEMBER ( CASE 108/AMYLUM V COUNCIL ( ) ECR ), THAT A SUBMISSION WHICH MAY BE REGARDED AS ' ' AMPLIFYING A SUBMISSION MADE PREVIOUSLY ' ' , DIRECTLY OR BY IMPLICATION IN THE ORIGINAL APPLICATION , MUST BE CONSIDERED ADMISSIBLE .   THE COURT NOTES THAT THE SECOND SUBMISSION IS CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THE FIRST SUBMISSION ALLEGING AN INFRINGEMENT OF THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF ANNEX III TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS , WHICH IS CITED IN THE APPLICATION . IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES , THAT SECOND SUBMISSION CONSTITUTES BY IMPLICATION A BRANCH OF THE FIRST SUBMISSION , AND MUST THEREFORE BE REGARDED AS ADMISSIBLE .   THE THIRD SUBMISSION HOWEVER APPEARS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE REPLY . THE INFRINGEMENT OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS WHICH IT ALLEGES DOES NOT APPEAR EITHER EXPRESSLY OR BY IMPLICATION IN THE APPLICATION .   THAT SUBMISSION IS THEREFORE ENTIRELY NEW AND IN CONSEQUENCE INADMISSIBLE .      SUBSTANCE   IN SUPPORT OF HIS FIRST TWO SUBMISSIONS , THE APPLICANT CLAIMS THAT THE DISPUTED DECISION CANNOT HAVE BEEN BASED ON THE CRITERION OF AN AGE-LIMIT INASMUCH AS THAT CRITERION WAS NOT MENTIONED IN THE VACANCY NOTICE AND WAS ADDED SUBSEQUENTLY BY THE SELECTION COMMITTEE , WHICH THUS ARBITRARILY ALTERED THE CONDITIONS OF ELIGIBILITY FOR THE VACANT POST .   THE PARLIAMENT RAISES THE OBJECTION THAT THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PROVISIONS OF ANNEX III TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS RELATE TO NOTICES OF COMPETITION AND ARE THEREFORE NOT APPLICABLE , SINCE THIS CASE CONCERNS THE EXCEPTIONAL RECRUITMENT PROCEDURE PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE ( ) AND NOT THAT OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS . THAT ARTICLE , THE PARLIAMENT STATES , NEITHER DEFINES NOR EXPLAINS THE SPECIAL PROCEDURE WHICH IT AUTHORIZES AND LEAVES THE CHOICE OF THE MOST APPROPRIATE MEANS FOR FILLING THE VACANT POST TO THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY . IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES , THE PROCEDURE APPLIED WAS NOT SUBJECT TO ANY OBLIGATION AS TO PRIOR PUBLICATION EITHER OF ALL OR ANY OF THE CRITERIA APPLICABLE .   IT APPEARS FROM THE FILE THAT THE RECRUITMENT PROCEDURE APPLIED IN THIS CASE IS INDEED THE SELECTION PROCEDURE PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE ( ) AND NOT THE COMPETITION PROCEDURE PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OR ( ) AND GOVERNED BY ANNEX III TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS . THERE ARE NO GROUNDS ON WHICH THE COURT MAY QUESTION THE PARLIAMENT ' S RIGHT TO APPLY THE PROCEDURE SELECTED IN THIS CASE .   WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THAT SPECIAL PROCEDURE , THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY IS NOT REQUIRED TO APPLY THE PROVISIONS OF ANNEX III TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS RELATING TO NOTICES OF COMPETITION . IT MAY THEREFORE APPLY IN THE COURSE OF THE PROCEDURE CRITERIA WHICH ARE NOT SET OUT IN THE VACANCY NOTICE AND SUCH CRITERIA NEED NOT BE PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL . THAT APPLIES EQUALLY TO A SELECTION COMMITTEE TO WHICH THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY HAS DELEGATED ITS RIGHT OF SELECTION .   MOREOVER , AS REGARDS THE APPLICANT ' S ARGUMENT TO THE EFFECT THAT THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY IS REQUIRED TO OBSERVE ALL THE RULES OF ANNEX III IN     CONNECTION WITH THE COMPETITION BECAUSE , IN APPLYING THE SPECIAL PROCEDURE OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , IT RELIED HEAVILY ON THOSE RULES , IT SHOULD BE OBSERVED THAT IN THIS CASE SUCH AN ARGUMENT IS NOT VALID , PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE , UNDER THAT PROCEDURE , THERE IS NO OBLIGATION TO OBSERVE THE RULES RELATING TO COMPETITIONS , AND BECAUSE THE FACT THAT THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY REFERRED TO PART OF THOSE RULES CAN IN NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE REGARDED AS CREATING AN OBLIGATION ON ITS PART .   THAT APPLIES IN PARTICULAR TO THE REQUIREMENT THAT AN AGE-LIMIT , IF THERE IS ONE , MUST BE INDICATED IN THE VACANCY NOTICE . CONSEQUENTLY THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY WAS NOT REQUIRED TO REFER EXPRESSLY TO THAT CONDITION IN THE VACANCY NOTICE ; NOR WAS IT REQUIRED TO FIX THE AGE-LIMIT ITSELF BUT WAS ENTITLED TO DELEGATE ITS POWER IN THAT RESPECT TO THE SELECTION COMMITTEE .   IT FOLLOWS THAT NEITHER OF THE SUBMISSIONS IS WELL FOUNDED AND THAT THE APPLICATION MUST BE DISMISSED .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE , THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS . HOWEVER , ACCORDING TO THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ), THE COURT MAY ORDER EVEN A SUCCESSFUL PARTY TO PAY COSTS WHICH THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT PARTY TO HAVE UNREASONABLY OR VEXATIOUSLY CAUSED THE OPPOSITE PARTY TO INCUR .   IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS ACTION RESULTS FROM THE FACT THAT THE PARLIAMENT FAILED TO INDICATE IN THE NOTICE OF COMPETITION THAT IN THE CASE IN QUESTION THE SPECIAL RECRUITMENT PROCEDURE PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS WAS TO BE APPLIED .   IN PROCEEDING AS IT DID , IT PROVOKED AN UNDERSTANDABLE ERROR ON THE PART OF THE APPLICANT AND CAUSED HIM TO INCUR THE EXPENSE OF AN ACTION TO NO AVAIL . IT MUST THEREFORE BE ORDERED TO PAY THE APPLICANT ' S COSTS .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ( SECOND CHAMBER )   HEREBY :   . DISMISSES THE APPLICATION :   2.ORDERS THE PARLIAMENT TO PAY THE COSTS OF THE PROCEEDINGS INCLUDING THOSE OF THE APPLICANT .
