Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE TARIFF CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES , 
Grounds
BY ORDER DATED APRIL , RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON MAY , THE BUNDESFINANZHOF REFERRED THE FOLLOWING QUESTION TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY :  ' IS NOTE IN CONJUNCTION WITH NOTE TO SECTION XVI OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF TO BE INTERPRETED TO THE EFFECT THAT PARTS OF APPLIANCES OR PARTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE FIRST-MENTIONED NOTE SHOULD BE REGARDED AS INCLUDING INDIVIDUAL ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES WHICH TOGETHER ARE NECESSARY COMPONENT PARTS OF AN ELECTRIC SOUND OR VISUAL SIGNALLING APPARATUS UNDER TARIFF HEADING 85.OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF BUT WHICH CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED UNDER THAT TARIFF HEADING BECAUSE THEY ARE TO BE CLASSIFIED WITHOUT THE CABLES LINKING THE INDIVIDUAL ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES AND WITHOUT THE ACOUSTIC OR OPTICAL ALARM DEVICES OR DOES NOTE ONLY REFER TO PARTS OF A PERMANENTLY ASSEMBLED UNIT?  '   THIS QUESTION HAS BEEN RAISED IN AN ACTION ON THE TARIFF CLASSIFICATION OF ARTICLES WHICH WERE DESCRIBED AS ' ULTRASONIC MOVEMENT DETECTORS ADVISOR III AND ADVISOR VI '  WHOSE FUNCTION IS TO DETECT MOVEMENT IN PARTICULAR AREAS AND TO TRANSMIT THIS INFORMATION BY MEANS OF ELECTRIC IMPULSES THROUGH ELECTRIC CABLES TO AN ALARM UNIT ( SOUND OR VISUAL ALARM SIGNALLING DEVICE ). BY TWO OFFICIAL TARIFF CLASSIFICATION OPINIONS DATED MAY THE CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES CLASSIFIED THOSE ARTICLES UNDER SUBHEADING 85.C OF SECTION XVI , CHAPTER , OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF ( ' ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES AND APPARATUS , HAVING INDIVIDUAL FUNCTIONS , NOT FALLING WITHIN ANY OTHER HEADING OF THIS CHAPTER : . . . OTHER ' ). THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION CONTESTS THAT CLASSIFICATION AND ALLEGES THAT THE ARTICLES IN QUESTION FALL UNDER HEADING 85.OF THE SAME SECTION AND CHAPTER : ' ELECTRIC SOUND OR VISUAL SIGNALLING APPARATUS ( SUCH AS . . . BURGLAR AND FIRE ALARMS ), OTHER THAN THOSE OF HEADING NO 85.OR 85.. '   NOTE TO SECTION XVI OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF MENTIONS ' PARTS OF MACHINES '  AND NOTE ' COMPOSITE MACHINES CONSISTING OF . . . MACHINES FITTED TOGETHER . . . ' . NOTE PROVIDES THAT THE EXPRESSION ' MACHINE '  MEANS ANY MACHINE , APPARATUS OR APPLIANCE OF A KIND FALLING WITHIN SECTION XVI .    THE BUNDESFINANZHOF MAKES IT CLEAR IN ITS QUESTION THAT THE LATTER RELATES TO THE CLASSIFICATION OF ' INDIVIDUAL ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES WHICH TOGETHER ARE NECESSARY COMPONENT PARTS OF AN ELECTRIC SOUND OR VISUAL SIGNALLING APPARATUS ' . THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER ARTICLES OF THE KIND IN QUESTION ARE ' PARTS OF MACHINES '  OR ' COMPOSITE MACHINES '  WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED NOTE AND .    NOTE READS : ' UNLESS THE HEADINGS OTHERWISE REQUIRE , COMPOSITE MACHINES CONSISTING OF TWO OR MORE MACHINES FITTED TOGETHER TO FORM A WHOLE AND OTHER MACHINES ADAPTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF PERFORMING TWO OR MORE COMPLEMENTARY OR ALTERNATIVE FUNCTIONS ARE TO BE CLASSIFIED AS IF CONSISTING ONLY OF THAT COMPONENT OR AS BEING THAT MACHINE WHICH PERFORMS THE PRINCIPAL FUNCTION ' . ACCORDING TO THE EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE BRUSSELS NOMENCLATURE RELATING TO THAT NOTE , FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE SAID TARIFF HEADINGS , ' MACHINES OF DIFFERENT KINDS ARE TAKEN TO BE FITTED TOGETHER TO FORM A WHOLE WHEN INCORPORATED ONE IN THE OTHER OR MOUNTED ONE ON THE OTHER '  OR , GENERALLY SPEAKING , WHERE THE MACHINES ARE FIRMLY FIXED TOGETHER AND THUS FORM A PHYSICAL UNIT . THE EXPLANATORY NOTES MOREOVER STATE THAT THE EXPRESSION ' COMPOSITE MACHINES '  FOR THE PURPOSES OF NOTE DOES NOT COVER MACHINES OR APPLIANCES CONSISTING ' OF SEPARATE COMPONENTS WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO CONTRIBUTE TOGETHER TO A SINGLE CLEARLY DEFINED FUNCTION ' , INCLUDING INTER ALIA ' BURGLAR ALARMS ' . IT APPEARS FROM THOSE EXPLANATORY NOTES THAT WHERE SEPARATE COMPONENT PARTS ARE JOINED TOGETHER AND DESIGNED TO FORM A FUNCTIONAL UNIT , SUCH AS A BURGLAR ALARM , THEY ARE TO BE REGARDED AS ' PARTS OF MACHINES '  WITHIN THE MEANING OF NOTE TO SECTION XVI OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF AND TO BE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE RULES CONTAINED IN LETTERS ( A ), ( B ) AND ( C ) OF THAT NOTE . IT IS A CONDITION OF CLASSIFICATION UNDER LETTER ( A ) OF THAT NOTE THAT THE PARTS OF MACHINES IN QUESTION ARE GOODS OF A KIND DESCRIBED IN ANY OF THE HEADINGS OF CHAPTERS AND . LETTER ( B ) OF THE NOTE RELATES TO PARTS ' IF SUITABLE FOR USE SOLELY OR PRINCIPALLY WITH A PARTICULAR KIND OF MACHINE , OR WITH A NUMBER OF MACHINES FALLING WITHIN THE SAME HEADING ' . IT IS NOT A CONDITION OF TARIFF CLASSIFICATION ACCORDING TO THAT PROVISION THAT THE PARTS IN QUESTION SHOULD INCLUDE ALL THE COMPONENT PARTS WHICH NORMALLY GO TO MAKE UP THE COMPLETE APPLIANCE . RULE ( A ) OF THE RULES FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF THE NOMENCLATURE OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF PROVIDES : ' ANY REFERENCE IN A HEADING TO AN ARTICLE SHALL BE TAKEN TO INCLUDE A REFERENCE TO THAT ARTICLE INCOMPLETE OR UNFINISHED , PROVIDED THAT , AS IMPORTED , THE INCOMPLETE OR UNFINISHED ARTICLE HAS THE ESSENTIAL CHARACTER OF THE COMPLETE OR FINISHED ARTICLE ' . THE NECESSARY COMPONENT PARTS OF AN APPLIANCE COVERED BY A TARIFF HEADING , WHICH FORM A FUNCTIONAL UNIT AND WHEN FITTED TOGETHER HAVE THE ESSENTIAL CHARACTER OF THE COMPLETE ARTICLE , ARE THEREFORE COVERED BY THE EXPRESSION ' PARTS '  WITHIN THE MEANING OF NOTE TO SECTION XVI OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF AND ARE TO BE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE CRITERIA SET OUT AT LETTER ( B ) OF THAT NOTE .   THE QUESTION REFERRED MUST THEREFORE BE ANSWERED TO THE EFFECT THAT NOTE IN CONJUNCTION WITH NOTE TO SECTION XVI OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF MUST BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT INDIVIDUAL ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES WHICH ARE SUITABLE FOR USE SOLELY OR PRINCIPALLY WITH AN ELECTRIC SOUND OR VISUAL SIGNALLING APPARATUS WITHIN THE MEANING OF TARIFF HEADING 85.ARE ' PARTS '  WITHIN THE MEANING OF THAT NOTE AND ARE TO BE CLASSIFIED ACCORDINGLY UNDER TARIFF HEADING 85.EVEN WHEN IMPORTED WITHOUT THE CABLES LINKING THE VARIOUS PARTS AND WITHOUT THE ACOUSTIC OR VISUAL ALARM SIGNALLING DEVICE .
