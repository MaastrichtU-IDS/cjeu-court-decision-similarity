Grounds
BY THREE JUDGMENTS OF OCTOBER 1985, WHICH WERE RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON NOVEMBER 1985, THE RECHTBANK VAN EERSTE AANLEG, BRUGES, REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FIVE QUESTIONS ON THE INTERPRETATION OF SEVERAL PROVISIONS OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 75/442/EEC OF JULY ON WASTE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL 1975, L*194, P . ).  THE QUESTIONS WERE RAISED IN THREE CRIMINAL ACTIONS AGAINST THREE OPERATORS OF WASTE-DISPOSAL UNDERTAKINGS, AND A DRIVER . THE ACCUSED WERE CHARGED WITH INFRINGING THE DECREE OF JULY OF THE FLEMISH COMMUNITY, WHICH IMPLEMENTED THE ABOVEMENTIONED DIRECTIVE, AND NUMEROUS IMPLEMENTING ORDERS, BY DISCHARGING WASTE IN FIELDS WITHOUT BEING IN POSSESSION OF A PERMIT .  HAVING DOUBTS AS TO THE COMPATIBILITY OF THE FLEMISH LEGISLATION WITH DIRECTIVE 75/442, THE RECHTBANK VAN EERSTE AANLEG SUBMITTED THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING :  ". ACCORDING TO WHAT CRITERIA SHOULD IT BE DETERMINED WHETHER AN UNDERTAKING IS SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES TO OF DIRECTIVE 75/442/EEC BECAUSE IT CARRIES ON WASTE-DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES COVERED BY THOSE PROVISIONS? IS A CASUAL OR ISOLATED OPERATION SUFFICIENT OR MUST OTHER CRITERIA BE SATISFIED, CONCERNING FOR EXAMPLE : THE OBJECTS OF THE COMPANY, THE OPERATIONS ACTUALLY CARRIED OUT IN THE FIELD OF WASTE DISPOSAL ( MAIN OR SUBSIDIARY ACTIVITY, OR REPEATED OPERATIONS ), THE LIKELY EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT, AND SO FORTH?  . IS THE CARRIER OBLIGED TO OBTAIN A PERMIT - BECAUSE HE ALSO DEPOSITS WASTE - EVEN IF HE ACTS ON THE INSTRUCTIONS, AT THE REQUEST OR WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE OWNER OR OCCUPIER OF LAND WHO IN LAW HAS ACQUIRED OWNERSHIP OF THE WASTE, AND CONVERSELY, IS THE OCCUPIER OR OWNER REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A PERMIT, OWING TO THE FACT THAT HE PERMITS THE WASTE TO BE DEPOSITED ( AND THUS DOES NOT DEPOSIT WASTE HIMSELF )?  . DOES A DISCHARGE PERMIT ISSUED BY THE DIRECTOR OF A WATER-PURIFYING COMPANY SET UP BY THE AUTHORITIES OF A MEMBER STATE COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF ARTICLES AND OF THE EEC DIRECTIVE OF JULY ON WASTE?  . TO WHAT EXTENT ARE THE MEMBER STATES FREE TO ORGANIZE THE SUPERVISION REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE OF THE AFORESAID EEC DIRECTIVE?  . DO THE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY ARTICLES AND OF DIRECTIVE 75/442/EEC APPLY DIRECTLY TO UNDERTAKINGS OR DOES THEIR APPLICATION DEPEND UPON THE PRIOR CREATION OR DESIGNATION BY THE MEMBER STATE OF THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY TO WHICH UNDERTAKINGS MAY APPLY, INTER ALIA IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY PERMIT, AND UPON THE ADOPTION OF THE NECESSARY IMPLEMENTING RULES, REGARDING SUCH MATTERS AS THE FORMS TO BE USED ON THE DEPOSIT OF WASTE, FOR EXAMPLE, FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENSURING SUPERVISION, IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE DIRECTIVE ENTERED INTO FORCE ( BY VIRTUE OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY AND ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE ) BY NOTIFICATION TO THE MEMBER STATES AND NOT BY PUBLICATION IN THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES?"  REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING FOR THE FACTS OF THE CASES BEFORE THE NATIONAL COURT, THE RELEVANT COMMUNITY PROVISIONS AND THE OBSERVATIONS SUBMITTED TO THE COURT, WHICH ARE MENTIONED OR DISCUSSED HEREINAFTER ONLY IN SO FAR AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE REASONING OF THE COURT .  IT SHOULD BE NOTED AT THE OUTSET THAT THE PURPOSE OF DIRECTIVE 75/IS TO HARMONIZE THE LEGISLATION OF THE VARIOUS MEMBER STATES CONCERNING WASTE DISPOSAL IN ORDER, ON THE ONE HAND, TO PREVENT THE DISPARITIES BETWEEN THOSE PROVISIONS GIVING RISE TO OBSTACLES TO INTRA-COMMUNITY TRADE AND UNEQUAL COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS AND, ON THE OTHER, TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ATTAINMENT OF THE OBJECTIVES OF THE COMMUNITY REGARDING THE PROTECTION OF HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT .  FOR THAT PURPOSE, ARTICLES TO 12, OF WHICH THE NATIONAL COURT SEEKS INTERPRETATION, REQUIRE THE MEMBER STATES TO ESTABLISH A SYSTEM OF SUPERVISION AND CONTROL OVER WASTE-DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES .  SUBJECT TO THE EXCLUSIONS PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE 2*(), ARTICLE ATTRIBUTES A BROAD SCOPE TO THE DIRECTIVE BY STATING THAT, FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE DIRECTIVE, "WASTE" IS TO MEAN ANY SUBSTANCE OR OBJECT WHICH THE HOLDER DISPOSES OF OR IS REQUIRED TO DISPOSE OF PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF NATIONAL LAW IN FORCE, AND THAT "DISPOSAL" MEANS THE COLLECTION, SORTING, TRANSPORT AND TREATMENT OF WASTE, AS WELL AS ITS STORAGE AND TIPPING ABOVE OR UNDER GROUND, AND IN ADDITION, THE TRANSFORMATION OPERATIONS NECESSARY FOR ITS RE-USE, RECOVERY OR RECYCLING .  THE FIRST QUESTION  WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST QUESTION, IT MUST BE OBSERVED THAT ARTICLES TO OF DIRECTIVE 75/COVER ALL WASTE-DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES AND DO NOT LAY DOWN ANY LIMITATION RELATING TO THE LEGAL STATUS OF THE OPERATOR OR THE FREQUENCY OR PURPOSE OF THE ACTIVITIES CONCERNED .  THE ESSENTIAL OBJECTIVE OF THE DIRECTIVE, SPECIFIED IN THE THIRD RECITAL IN THE PREAMBLE THERETO AND IN ARTICLE 4, NAMELY THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT, WOULD IN ANY EVENT BE ENDANGERED IF THE APPLICATION OF MEASURES FOR THE CONTROL AND SUPERVISION OF SUCH ACTIVITIES WERE TO BE CONDITIONAL UPON DISTINCTIONS BASED ON CRITERIA SUCH AS THE COMPANY OBJECTS OF THE UNDERTAKING, WHETHER THE DISPOSAL OF WASTE IS A MAIN OR SUBSIDIARY ACTIVITY OR THE FORESEEABLE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT .  IT MUST THEREFORE BE STATED IN REPLY TO THE FIRST QUESTION THAT ANY OPERATOR ENGAGING IN ANY OF THE ACTIVITIES REFERRED TO IN ARTICLES TO OF DIRECTIVE 75/IS SUBJECT TO THE MEASURES PROVIDED FOR IN THOSE PROVISIONS .  THE SECOND QUESTION  THE SECOND QUESTION CONCERNS THE ROLE AND THE POSITION OF THE OWNER OR OCCUPIER OF THE LAND ON WHICH THE WASTE IS TIPPED IN RELATION TO THE REQUIREMENT OF A PERMIT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE .  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE CONSENT OF THE OWNER OR OCCUPIER OF THE LAND WHERE WASTE IS TIPPED CANNOT BE SUBSTITUTED FOR THE PERMIT TO BE ISSUED BY A COMPETENT AUTHORITY DESIGNATED BY THE MEMBER STATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE . IT IS CLEAR FROM THE VERY TERMS OF ARTICLE THAT "ANY INSTALLATION OR UNDERTAKING TREATING, STORING OR TIPPING WASTE ON BEHALF OF THIRD PARTIES MUST OBTAIN A PERMIT FROM THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE ".  AS REGARDS THE QUESTION WHETHER AN OWNER OR OCCUPIER OF LAND IS OBLIGED TO HOLD A PERMIT IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF THE WASTE TIPPED ON HIS LAND, IT IS APPARENT FROM THE AFOREMENTIONED ARTICLE THAT THE REQUIREMENT TO HOLD A PERMIT APPLIES ONLY TO AN UNDERTAKING OPERATING ON BEHALF OF THIRD PARTIES . PERSONS WHO DISPOSE OF THEIR OWN WASTE ARE SUBJECT ONLY TO "SUPERVISION BY THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 5" ( ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE ); HOWEVER, THE "NECESSARY MEASURES" TO BE TAKEN BY THE MEMBER STATES UNDER ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE MAY INCLUDE IMPOSING UPON SUCH PERSONS THE OBLIGATION TO OBTAIN A PERMIT .  IT MUST THEREFORE BE STATED IN REPLY TO THE SECOND QUESTION THAT THE PERMIT PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF DIRECTIVE 75/IS ISSUED BY THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY ESTABLISHED OR DESIGNATED BY THE MEMBER STATES PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE AND CANNOT BE REPLACED BY THE CONSENT OF THE OWNER OR OCCUPIER OF THE LAND WHERE THE WASTE IS DISCHARGED; AN OWNER OR OCCUPIER OF LAND, AS AN OPERATOR TIPPING HIS OWN WASTE ON THAT LAND, DOES NOT NEED A PERMIT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE BUT A MEASURE SUBJECTING HIM TO SUCH A REQUIREMENT MAY BE ADOPTED AS ONE OF THE NECESSARY MEASURES TO BE TAKEN BY THE MEMBER STATES UNDER ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE .  THE THIRD QUESTION  IN ITS THIRD QUESTION, THE NATIONAL COURT ASKS ESSENTIALLY WHETHER DIRECTIVE 75/PREVENTS A MEMBER STATE FROM DESIGNATING THE DIRECTOR OF A WATER-PURIFYING COMPANY, SET UP BY THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES, AS THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE TO ISSUE THE PERMIT REQUIRED UNDER ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE .  IN THEIR OBSERVATIONS, THE COMMISSION AND THE PROCUREUR DES KONINGS HAVE POINTED OUT THAT, IN ASKING THAT QUESTION, THE NATIONAL COURT IN FACT HAS IN MIND A PERMIT PROVIDED FOR BY THE LAW OF MARCH ON THE PROTECTION OF SURFACE WATERS AGAINST POLLUTION, WHICH SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED WITH THE PERMIT PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE .  NO VIEW WILL BE EXPRESSED ON THAT MATTER, SINCE IT FALLS WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE NATIONAL COURT, BUT IT MUST BE STATED THAT ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE DOES NOT LAY DOWN ANY RESTRICTIVE CRITERIA CONCERNING THE "COMPETENT ... AUTHORITIES TO BE RESPONSIBLE, IN A GIVEN ZONE, FOR THE PLANNING, ORGANIZATION, AUTHORIZATION AND SUPERVISION OF WASTE-DISPOSAL OPERATIONS", WHICH ARE TO BE ESTABLISHED OR DESIGNATED BY THE MEMBER STATES . THE MEMBER STATES ARE THEREFORE UNRESTRICTED IN THEIR CHOICE OF SUCH AUTHORITIES .  IT MUST THEREFORE BE STATED IN REPLY TO THE THIRD QUESTION THAT DIRECTIVE 75/DOES NOT PREVENT A MEMBER STATE FROM DESIGNATING THE DIRECTOR OF A WATER-PURIFYING COMPANY, SET UP BY THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES, AS THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE TO ISSUE THE PERMIT REQUIRED UNDER ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE .  THE FOURTH QUESTION  IN ITS FOURTH QUESTION, THE NATIONAL COURT SEEKS TO DETERMINE THE SCOPE OF THE DISCRETIONARY POWER ENJOYED BY MEMBER STATES REGARDING ORGANIZATION OF THE SUPERVISION PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF DIRECTIVE 75/.  THAT ARTICLE PROVIDES THAT :  "UNDERTAKINGS TRANSPORTING, COLLECTING, STORING, TIPPING OR TREATING THEIR OWN WASTE AND THOSE WHICH COLLECT OR TRANSPORT WASTE ON BEHALF OF THIRD PARTIES SHALL BE SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION BY THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE ."  THAT PROVISION DOES NOT THEREFORE LAY DOWN ANY PARTICULAR REQUIREMENT RESTRICTING THE FREEDOM OF THE MEMBER STATES REGARDING THE WAY IN WHICH THEY ORGANIZE THE SUPERVISION OF THE ACTIVITIES REFERRED TO THEREIN . THAT FREEDOM MUST, HOWEVER, BE EXERCISED HAVING DUE REGARD TO THE OBJECTIVES MENTIONED IN THE THIRD RECITAL IN THE PREAMBLE TO THE DIRECTIVE AND IN ARTICLE THEREOF, NAMELY THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN HEALTH AND OF THE ENVIRONMENT .  IT IS THEREFORE APPROPRIATE TO STATE IN REPLY TO THE FOURTH QUESTION THAT, SUBJECT TO THE USUAL LIMITATIONS UPON THE EXERCISE OF A DISCRETIONARY POWER, THE POWER VESTED IN THE MEMBER STATES REGARDING ORGANIZATION OF THE SUPERVISION PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF DIRECTIVE 75/IS QUALIFIED ONLY BY THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE OBJECTIVES OF THE DIRECTIVE, NAMELY THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN HEALTH AND OF THE ENVIRONMENT, MUST BE COMPLIED WITH .  THE FIFTH QUESTION  IN ITS FIFTH QUESTION, THE NATIONAL COURT ESSENTIALLY SEEKS TO DETERMINE WHETHER ARTICLES AND OF THE DIRECTIVE DIRECTLY IMPOSE OBLIGATIONS ON OPERATORS OR WHETHER IMPLEMENTING MEASURES MUST BE ADOPTED BY THE MEMBER STATES .  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE COURT HAS ALREADY HELD "THAT A DIRECTIVE MAY NOT OF ITSELF IMPOSE OBLIGATIONS ON AN INDIVIDUAL AND THAT A PROVISION OF A DIRECTIVE MAY NOT BE RELIED UPON AS SUCH AGAINST SUCH A PERSON" ( CASE 152/MARSHALL (( )) ECR ).  MOREOVER, IT IS APPARENT FROM THE VERY WORDING OF ARTICLES AND THAT THEIR IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRES THE MEMBER STATES TO ESTABLISH OR DESIGNATE THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE . ARTICLE PROVIDES THAT ANY UNDERTAKING TREATING, STORING OR TIPPING WASTE ON BEHALF OF THIRD PARTIES MUST OBTAIN A PERMIT "FROM THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 5", AND ARTICLE PROVIDES THAT UNDERTAKINGS ARE REQUIRED TO SUPPLY CERTAIN INFORMATION "TO THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE ". MOREOVER, THOSE ARTICLES CONTAIN NO RULES AS TO THE PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE CONDITIONS TO BE FULFILLED IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE PERMIT REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE OR SPECIFIC DETAILS OF THE INFORMATION REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE . IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY FOR PROVISIONS TO BE ADOPTED FOR THAT PURPOSE BY THE MEMBER STATES .  IT MUST THEREFORE BE STATED IN REPLY TO THE FIFTH QUESTION THAT ARTICLES AND OF DIRECTIVE 75/DO NOT DIRECTLY IMPOSE OBLIGATIONS UPON PERSONS OR UNDERTAKINGS .
