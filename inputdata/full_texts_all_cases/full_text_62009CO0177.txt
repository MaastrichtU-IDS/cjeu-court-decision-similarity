Operative part 
1.
	Article 1(5) of Council Directive 85/337/EEC of June on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private
                     projects on the environment, as amended by Directive 2003/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 2003,
                     must be interpreted as meaning that only projects adopted in detail by a specific legislative act, so that the objectives
                     of that directive have been achieved by the legislative process, are excluded from the directive’s ambit. It is for the national
                     court to ascertain whether those two conditions have been satisfied, taking account both of the content of the legislative
                     act adopted and of the entire legislative process which led to its adoption, in particular the preparatory documents and parliamentary
                     debates. In that regard, a legislative act which does no more than simply ‘ratify’ a pre-existing administrative act, by merely
                     referring to overriding reasons relating to the general interest without a substantive legislative process enabling those
                     conditions to be fulfilled having first been begun, cannot be regarded as a specific legislative act for the purposes of that
                     provision and is therefore not sufficient to exclude a project from the ambit of Directive 85/337, as amended by Directive
                     2003/35. 
                  
2.
	Article 9(2) of the Convention on access to information, public participation in decision making and access to justice in
                     environmental matters, concluded on June and approved on behalf of the European Community by Council Decision 2005/370/EC
                     of February 2005, and Article 10a of Directive 85/337, as amended by Directive 2003/35, must be interpreted as meaning
                     that:
                  
–        when a project falling within the ambit of those provisions is adopted by a legislative act, it must be possible, under the
         national procedural rules, for the question whether that legislative act satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 1(5)
         of that directive to be submitted to a court of law or an independent and impartial body established by law;
      
–        if no review procedure of the nature and scope set out above were available in respect of such an act, any national court
         before which an action falling within its jurisdiction is brought would have the task of carrying out the review described
         in the previous indent and acting upon it, if need be by disapplying that legislative act.
