Operative part
The Court:
1.
	Declares that, by systematically accepting, during the years to 2002, customs declarations of release for free circulation
                     of fresh bananas by its customs authorities, when the latter knew or ought reasonably to have known that the declared weight
                     of the bananas did not correspond to their actual weight and because of the Portuguese authorities’ refusal to make available
                     own resources corresponding to the loss of revenue and interest due for late payment, the Portuguese Republic has failed to
                     fulfil its obligations under Articles 13, and of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/of October establishing
                     the Community Customs Code, read in conjunction with Article 290a of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/of July laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/establishing the Community Customs Code,
                     as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 89/of January 1997, and under Articles 2, 6, and to of  Council Regulation
                     (EEC, Euratom) No 1552/of May implementing Decision 88/376/EEC, Euratom on the system of the Communities’ own resources,
                     as amended by Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 1355/of July 1996, and under the same articles of Council Regulation
                     (EC, Euratom) No 1150/of May implementing Decision 94/728/EC, Euratom on the system of the Communities’ own resources;
