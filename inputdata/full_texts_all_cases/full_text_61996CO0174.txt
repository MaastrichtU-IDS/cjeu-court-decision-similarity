Summary
Whatever his standing, a party within the meaning of the third paragraph of Article of the Statute of the Court of Justice is not authorized to act in person before the Court, but must use the services of a third person authorized to practise before a court of a Member State or of a State which is a party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.Since no derogation from or exception to that obligation is provided for by the Statute or the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, the submission of an application signed by the applicant himself, even if he is a lawyer authorized to plead before a national court, cannot be sufficient for the purpose of bringing an action.
