Operative part
1.
	Pursuant to Article 15(1)(c) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/of June on the common organisation of the markets
                     in the sugar sector, the exportable surplus includes the quantities of sugar which fall under that article contained in the
                     processed products exported, regardless of whether or not refunds have actually been paid.
                  
Article 15(1)(d) of that regulation is to be interpreted as meaning that all the quantities of exported products which fall
         under that article must, regardless of whether or not refunds have actually been paid, be taken into account for the purpose
         of calculating both the exportable surplus and the average loss per tonne of product.
      
Examination of Article 6(4) and (5) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 314/of February laying down detailed rules
         for the application of the quota system in the sugar sector, where appropriate, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No
         1140/of June and Commission Regulation (EC) No 38/of January has not disclosed the existence of any
         factors such as to affect its validity.

                     (EC) No 1837/of October fixing the production levies and the coefficient for the additional levy in the sugar
                     sector for the marketing year 2001/has not disclosed the existence of any factors such as to affect their validity.
