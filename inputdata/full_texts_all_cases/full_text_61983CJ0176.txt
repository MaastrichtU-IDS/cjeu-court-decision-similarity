Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON AUGUST , ALAIN PIERRE ALLO AND OTHER OFFICIALS OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THEIR SALARY SLIPS FOR DECEMBER CONTAINING STATEMENTS OF SALARY ARREARS PAID PURSUANT TO COUNCIL REGULATION ( ECSC , EEC , EURATOM ) NO 3139/OF NOVEMBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , OF 26.11., P . ) AND , IN SO FAR AS IS NECESSARY , FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE EXPRESS OR IMPLIED DECISIONS REJECTING THE COMPLAINTS LODGED UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS . THE APPLICANTS SEEK THE ANNULMENT OF THOSE MEASURES IN SO FAR AS THE SALARY ARREARS FOR THE PERIOD COMMENCING ON JULY WERE NOT INCREASED , IN SPITE OF THE LOSS OF PURCHASING POWER RESULTING FROM THE DELAY IN PAYMENT , BY INTEREST CALCULATED AT THE NORMAL RATE TO WHICH THEY CLAIM TO BE ENTITLED . THE APPLICANTS ALSO SEEK AN ORDER REQUIRING THE COMMISSION TO PAY THEM COMPENSATORY INTEREST ON ACCOUNT OF THE LOSS OF PURCHASING POWER .  ON JANUARY THE COUNCIL ADOPTED REGULATION ( EURATOM , ECSC , EEC ) NO 187/ADJUSTING THE SALARIES AND PENSIONS OF OFFICIALS AND OTHER SERVANTS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES AND THE WEIGHTINGS APPLYING THERETO ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , OF 24.1., P . ), ACTING ON A PROPOSAL TO THAT EFFECT SUBMITTED BY THE COMMISSION ON DECEMBER .   IN PURSUANCE OF THAT REGULATION , ON FEBRUARY THE COUNCIL ADOPTED REGULATION ( EURATOM , ECSC , EEC ) NO 397/FIXING THE TABLES OF SALARIES AND OTHER COMPONENTS OF REMUNERATION ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , OF 19.2., P . ).  ON MARCH THE COMMISSION BROUGHT AN ACTION REQUESTING THE COURT TO DECLARE VOID REGULATION NO 187/AND ARTICLES ( A ), ( A ), ( B ) AND THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 397/.   IN ITS JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER IN CASE 59/( COMMISSION V COUNCIL ( ) ECR ), THE COURT DECLARED VOID REGULATION NO 187/AND THE AFORESAID PROVISIONS OF REGULATION NO 397/.   IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THAT JUDGMENT , THE COUNCIL ADOPTED REGULATION NO 3139/OF NOVEMBER , ACTING ON A PROPOSAL FROM THE COMMISSION DATED OCTOBER .   THE COMMISSION , IN ITS CAPACITY AS THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY , PROCEEDED TO CALCULATE AND PAY SALARY ARREARS PURSUANT TO THE AFORESAID REGULATION .  EACH OF THE APPLICANTS LODGED A STANDARD-FORM COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS CONTENDING THAT ACCOUNT HAD TO BE TAKEN OF THE LOSS OF PURCHASING POWER DURING THE PERIOD IN RESPECT OF WHICH THE ARREARS WERE PAID PURSUANT TO COUNCIL REGULATION NO 3139/AND CLAIMING DEFAULT INTEREST WHICH , IN THEIR VIEW , SHOULD HAVE BEEN PAID TOGETHER WITH THOSE ARREARS .  THOSE COMPLAINTS WERE REJECTED BY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED DECISIONS , WHEREUPON THE APPLICANTS COMMENCED THESE PROCEEDINGS .  ADMISSIBILITY  THE COMMISSION RAISES CERTAIN OBJECTIONS CONCERNING THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION WHICH ARE CONSIDERED BELOW .  NATURE OF THE SALARY SLIPS  THE COMMISSION RAISES AN OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY INASMUCH AS THE APPLICATION CHALLENGES THE VALIDITY OF SALARY SLIPS WHICH DO NOT REPRESENT DECISIONS BUT ARE SIMPLY MEASURES IMPLEMENTING COUNCIL REGULATION NO 3139/.   THE APPLICANTS MAINTAIN IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT THE SALARY SLIPS DID NOT HAVE THE EFFECT OF PLACING THEM IN THE SITUATION IN WHICH THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IF THE REMUNERATION TO WHICH THEY WERE ENTITLED HAD BEEN PAID TO THEM WHEN IT WAS LEGALLY DUE . HENCE , IN THEIR VIEW , THOSE SALARY SLIPS CONSTITUTE DECISIONS ADVERSELY AFFECTING THEM AND MAY THEREFORE BE CHALLENGED BY AN APPEAL UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS . THE APPLICANTS REFER TO A JUDGMENT OF FEBRUARY IN WHICH THE COURT RECOGNIZED THE ADMISSIBILITY OF ACTIONS CHALLENGING THE VALIDITY OF SALARY SLIPS ( JOINED CASES TO , , , TO , , , , AND TO 137/, SCHOTS-KORTNER AND OTHERS V COUNCIL , COMMISSION AND PARLIAMENT ( ) ECR ).  IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND , AS THE COURT HAS STATED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS , MOST RECENTLY IN ITS JUDGMENT OF JANUARY IN CASE 262/( ANDERSEN AND OTHERS V PARLIAMENT ( ) ECR ), THAT A SALARY STATEMENT MAY CONSTITUTE A MEASURE ADVERSELY AFFECTING AN OFFICIAL AND MAY THEREFORE BE THE SUBJECT OF AN ACTION ; THE FACT THAT THE INSTITUTION CONCERNED IS ONLY APPLYING THE REGULATIONS IN FORCE IS IRRELEVANT IN THAT RESPECT . THE OBJECTION RAISED BY THE COMMISSION MUST THEREFORE BE REJECTED .  ADMISSIBILITY OF THE ACTION TO ESTABLISH LIABILITY  THE COMMISSION MAINTAINS THAT THE SECOND LIMB OF THE APPLICATION , NAMELY THE ACTION TO ESTABLISH THE DEFENDANT ' S LIABILITY ON THE GROUND THAT COUNCIL REGULATION NO 3139/IS UNLAWFUL , IS IN REALITY AN ACTION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THAT REGULATION AND , SINCE THE APPLICANTS HAVE NOT CHALLENGED THAT REGULATION DIRECTLY , THEY CANNOT , BY BRINGING AN ACTION FOR DAMAGES , CIRCUMVENT THE INADMISSIBILITY OF AN APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT AND ACHIEVE THE SAME RESULT AS THEY WOULD HAVE OBTAINED IF THEY HAD BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR ANNULMENT .  IN REPLY THE APPLICANTS STATE THAT ANY ACTION THEY MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT FOR THE ANNULMENT OF REGULATION NO 3139/WOULD HAVE BEEN INADMISSIBLE IN VIEW OF THE LEGISLATIVE NATURE OF THAT MEASURE . THEY EMPHASIZE THAT THE COMMISSION ITSELF RAISED AN OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY WITH REGARD TO ACTIONS FOR THE ANNULMENT OF A COUNCIL REGULATION AND THAT THE OBJECTION WAS UPHELD BY THE COURT IN ITS JUDGMENTS OF OCTOBER IN CASE 48/( OOMS V COMMISSION ( ) ECR ) AND OF NOVEMBER IN CASE 532/( AMESZ AND OTHERS V COMMISSION AND COUNCIL ( ) ECR ).  THE APPLICANTS REFER TO THE CASE-LAW OF THE COURT ACCORDING TO WHICH , IN PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING OFFICIALS AND RELATING TO THE LEGALITY OF AN ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE APPLICANT , THE COURT HAS JURISDICTION WHATEVER THE NATURE OF THE ACTION , AND THEY INFER THAT THEY HAVE LOCUS STANDI TO CLAIM BOTH ANNULMENT AND DAMAGES PROVIDED THAT THE CONDITIONS FOR BRINGING ACTIONS UNDER THE STAFF REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN SATISFIED .  IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND IN THAT REGARD THAT , UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY , ANY PARTY MAY , IN PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH A REGULATION IS IN ISSUE , CHALLENGE ITS LEGALITY . THE OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY RAISED BY THE COMMISSION MUST THEREFORE BE REJECTED .  HOWEVER , AS THE COURT HELD IN ITS JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER IN CASE 9/( MEYER-BURCKHARDT V COMMISSION ( ) ECR ), A DISPUTE BETWEEN AN OFFICIAL AND THE INSTITUTION BY WHICH HE IS EMPLOYED , EVEN IF IT INVOLVES AN ACTION FOR DAMAGES , IS PURSUED , WHERE IT ORIGINATES IN THE RELATIONSHIP OF EMPLOYMENT BETWEEN THE PERSON CONCERNED AND THE INSTITUTION , UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY AND ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS . ACCORDINGLY , THE APPLICANTS HAVE LOCUS STANDI TO SUBMIT BOTH A CLAIM FOR ANNULMENT AND A CLAIM FOR DAMAGES PROVIDED THAT THEY SATISFY THE CONDITIONS LAID DOWN BY THE STAFF REGULATIONS , WHICH ARE THE SAME FOR BOTH MEANS OF REDRESS .  IT MUST BE NOTED THAT , IN THIS CASE , AS IS CLEAR FROM THE DOCUMENTS BEFORE THE COURT , THE APPLICANTS CLAIMED ONLY DEFAULT INTEREST IN THEIR COMPLAINTS AND NOT COMPENSATORY INTEREST WHICH THEY CLAIMED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR APPLICATION TO THE COURT . CONSEQUENTLY , THEIR APPLICATION IS INADMISSIBLE IN SO FAR AS IT CONCERNS THE PAYMENT OF COMPENSATORY INTEREST .  SUBSTANCE  AS REGARDS THE SUBSTANCE , THE CASE RAISES CERTAIN QUESTIONS WHICH SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE FULL COURT .  
Decision on costs
