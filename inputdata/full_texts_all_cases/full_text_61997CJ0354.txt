Grounds
By application lodged at the Court Registry on October 1997, the Commission of the European Communities brought an action under Article of the EC Treaty for a declaration that, by failing to bring into force within the periods prescribed the laws, regulations and administrative provisions - including, where appropriate, sanctions - necessary to comply with - Council Directive 93/74/EEC of September on feedingstuffs intended for particular nutritional purposes (OJ L 237, p. 23), - Council Directive 94/28/EC of June laying down the principles relating to the zootechnical and genealogical conditions applicable to imports from third countries of animals, their semen, ova and embryos, and amending Directive 77/504/EEC on pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species (OJ L 178, p. 66), - Commission Directive 94/39/EC of July establishing a list of intended uses of animal feedingstuffs for particular nutritional purposes (OJ L 207, p. 20), - Commission Directive 95/9/EC of April amending Directive 94/39/EC (OJ L 91, p. 35), and - Commission Directive 95/10/EC of April fixing the method of calculating the energy value of dog and cat food intended for particular nutritional purposes (OJ L 91, p. 39), and/or by failing to notify the Commission thereof, the French Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article of Directive 93/74, Article of Directive 94/28, Article of Directive 94/39, Article of Directive 95/and Article of Directive 95/10. Under Article of Directive 94/28, Member States were required to bring into force the measures necessary to comply with the directive by July 1995.  Under Article of Directive 93/74, Article of Directive 94/39, Article of Directive 95/and Article of Directive 95/10, they were required to adopt the necessary measures no later than June 1995.  Those provisions also required the Member States to notify the Commission immediately of the measures adopted. Having ascertained that those deadlines had passed without the French Republic notifying it of the adoption of implementing measures, the Commission gave the French Government notice by letter of October 1995, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article of the Treaty, to submit its observations within two months of receiving that letter. Regarding Directive 93/74, the French Government replied by letter of January that a draft decree had been prepared and was due to be published in April 1996. Subsequently, under cover of a letter of January 1996, the French Government forwarded a copy of a draft decree designed to transpose Directive 93/into national law. It also advised the Commission that transposition was scheduled for the month of April 1996. As regards Directive 94/28, the French Government replied by letter of January that transposition of that directive into national law was under way and was to be completed during the first four months of 1996. As regards Directive 94/39, the French Government informed the Commission by letter of January that the procedure for transposing that measure into national law was scheduled for completion during the first six months of 1996.  Subsequently, by letter of January 1996, it advised the Commission that the directive's transposition into national law was expected to take place in May 1996. As regards Directive 95/9, the French Government informed the Commission by letter of January that transposition into national law was due to take place in April 1996, at the same time as Directive 93/74.  Later, by letter of January 1996, the French Government advised the Commission that transposition would take place in May 1996. As regards Directive 95/10, the French Government replied by letter of January that transposition into national law was expected to take place during the first six months of 1996.  Later, by letter of January 1996, the French authorities advised the Commission that the directive was due to be transposed into national law in May 1996. In the absence of any further notification, the Commission sent the French Republic reasoned opinions setting out its view that, by not adopting the measures necessary for the transposition of the five directives into national law, France had failed to fulfil its obligations under those directives.  The reasoned opinions relating to Directives 93/74, 94/28, 94/and 95/were sent on November 1996.  The reasoned opinion concerning Directive 95/was sent on November 1996. As regards Directive 94/28, the French Government informed the Commission by letter of March that a draft law for the transposition of that directive into national law was being debated in the French Parliament. The Commission did not subsequently receive any information as to the outcome of that debate. The other reasoned opinions drew no response. The Commission therefore decided to bring the present proceedings. In its defence, the French Government does not deny that the five directives were not transposed into national law within the periods prescribed.  It states, however, that the procedure for implementing the directives has reached an advanced stage and confirms its intention to adopt, without further delay, all the measures necessary for the transposition of the directives into national law. Since the transposition of the five directives into national law was not effected within the periods prescribed therein, the action brought by the Commission on that ground must be regarded as well founded. It must therefore be held that, by failing to adopt within the periods prescribed the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with Directives 93/74, 94/28, 94/39, 95/and 95/10, the French Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article of Directive 93/74, Article of Directive 94/28, Article of Directive 94/39, Article of Directive 95/and Article of Directive 95/10. 
Decision on costs
Costs Under Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party's pleadings.  Since the Commission has applied for costs and the French Republic has been unsuccessful in its pleadings, the latter must be ordered to pay the costs. 
Operative part
On those grounds, THE COURT (First Chamber) hereby: 1. Declares that, by failing to adopt within the periods prescribed the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with - Council Directive 93/74/EEC of September on feedingstuffs intended for particular nutritional purposes, - Council Directive 94/28/EC of June laying down the principles relating to the zootechnical and genealogical conditions applicable to imports from third countries of animals, their semen, ova and embryos, and amending Directive 77/504/EEC on pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species, - Commission Directive 94/39/EC of July establishing a list of intended uses of animal feedingstuffs for particular nutritional purposes, - Commission Directive 95/9/EC of April amending Directive 94/39, and - Commission Directive 95/10/EC of April fixing the method of calculating the energy value of dog and cat food intended for particular nutritional purposes, the French Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article of Directive 93/74, Article of Directive 94/28, Article of Directive 94/39, Article of Directive 95/and Article of Directive 95/10; 2. Orders the French Republic to pay the costs.
