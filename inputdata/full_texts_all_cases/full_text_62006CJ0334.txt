(Directive 91/439/EEC – Mutual recognition of driving licences – Withdrawal of a licence in one Member State for use of narcotic drugs or alcohol – New licence issued in another Member State – Refusal to recognise right to drive in the first Member State – Residence not in accordance with Directive 91/439/EEC)
Summary of the Judgment
Transport – Road transport – Driving licences – Directive 91/(Council Directive 91/439, as amended by Regulation No 1882/2003, Arts 1(2), 7(1), and 8(2) and (4))
On a proper construction of Articles 1(2), 7(1) and 8(2) and (4) of Directive 91/on driving licences, as amended by Regulation
         No 1882/2003, it is contrary to those provisions for a Member State to refuse to recognise in its territory the right to drive
         stemming from a driving licence subsequently issued by another Member State beyond any period in which the person concerned
         is forbidden to apply for a new licence and, therefore, to recognise the validity of that licence, so long as the licence-holder
         has not satisfied the necessary conditions in that first Member State for the issue of a new licence following the withdrawal
         of a previous licence, including the examination of fitness to drive certifying that the grounds justifying the withdrawal
         are no longer in existence. 
      
In the same circumstances, it is not contrary to those provisions for a Member State to refuse to recognise in its territory
         the right to drive stemming from a driving licence subsequently issued by another Member State, if it is established, on the
         basis of entries appearing in the driving licence itself or of other incontestable information supplied by the Member State
         of issue, that when that licence was issued its holder, who had been the object, in the territory of the first Member State,
         of a measure withdrawing an earlier licence, was not normally resident in the territory of the Member State of issue.

Judgment
The references for a preliminary ruling concern the interpretation of Articles 1(2) and 8(2) and (4) of Council Directive
         91/439/EEC of July on driving licences (OJ L 237, p. 1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1882/of the European
         Parliament and of the Council of September (OJ L 284, p. 1, ‘Directive 91/439’). 
      
The references have been made in three sets of proceedings, between Mr Zerche (Case C-334/06) and Mr Seuke (Case C‑336/06)
         and the Landkreis Mittweida (rural district authority of Mittweida) and between Mr Schubert (Case C‑335/06) and the Landkreis
         Mittlerer Erzgebirgskreis (rural district authority of Mittlerer Erzgebirgskreis) concerning the Federal Republic of Germany’s
         refusal to recognise the driving licences obtained by Mr Zerche, Mr Seuke and Mr Schubert in the Czech Republic after the
         administrative withdrawal of their German driving licences for consumption of alcohol.
      
 Legal context
 The relevant provisions of Community law
The first recital in the preamble to Directive 91/439, which repealed First Council Directive 80/1263/EEC of December on the introduction of a Community driving licence (OJ L 375, p. 1), states, as from July 1996:
      
‘… [F]or the purpose of the common transport policy, and as a contribution to improving road traffic safety, as well as to
         facilitate the movement of persons settling in a Member State other than that in which they have passed a driving test, it
         is desirable that there should be a Community model national driving licence mutually recognised by the Member States without
         any obligation to exchange licences.’
      
It is stated in the fourth recital of the preamble to that directive:
      
‘… [O]n road safety grounds, the minimum requirements for the issue of a driving licence should be laid down.’
The last recital in the preamble to Directive 91/states:
      
‘… [F]or reasons connected with road safety and traffic, Member States should be able to apply their national provisions on
         the withdrawal, suspension and cancellation of driving licences to all licence holders having acquired normal residence in
         their territory.’
      
Article of Directive 91/provides:
      
‘1.      Member States shall introduce a national driving licence based on the Community model described in Annex I or Ia, in accordance
         with the provisions of this Directive …
      
2.      Driving licences issued by Member States shall be mutually recognised.
3.      Where the holder of a valid national driving licence takes up normal residence in a Member State other than that which issued
         the licence, the host Member State may apply to the holder of the licence its national rules on the period of validity of
         the licences, medical checks and tax arrangements and may enter on the licence any information indispensable for administration.’
      
In accordance with Article 7(1) of Directive 91/439, the issue of a driving licence is subject to the following conditions:
      
‘Driving licences shall, moreover, be issued only to those applicants:
(a)      who have passed a test of skills and behaviour and a theoretical test and who meet medical standards, in accordance with the
         provisions of Annexes II and III;
      
(b)      who have their normal residence in the territory of the Member State issuing the licence, or can produce evidence that they
         have been studying there for at least six months.’
      
In accordance with point of Annex III to the directive, headed ‘Minimum standards of physical and mental fitness for driving
         a power-driven vehicle’, alcohol consumption constitutes a major danger to road safety and in view of the scale of the problem
         the medical profession must be very vigilant. The first subparagraph of point 14.of that annex states that ‘[d]riving licences
         shall not be issued to, or renewed for, applicants or drivers who are dependent on alcohol or unable to refrain from drinking
         and driving’. The second subparagraph of point 14.provides that ‘[a]fter a proven period of abstinence and subject to authorised
         medical opinion and regular medical check-ups, driving licences may be issued to, or renewed for, applicants or drivers who
         have in the past been dependent on alcohol’.
      
It is clear from point of that annex that the standards set by Member States for a medical examination before the issue
         or any subsequent renewal of driving licences may be stricter than those set out in the annex.
      
In accordance with Article 7(5) of the directive:
      
‘No person may hold a driving licence from more than one Member State.’
Article of Directive 91/provides:
      
‘...
2.      Subject to observance of the principle of territoriality of criminal and police laws, the Member State of normal residence
         may apply its national provisions on the restriction, suspension, withdrawal or cancellation of the right to drive to the
         holder of a driving licence issued by another Member State and, if necessary, exchange the licence for that purpose. 
      
…
4.      A Member State may refuse to recognise the validity of any driving licence issued by another Member State to a person who
         is, in the former State’s territory, the subject of one of the measures referred to in paragraph 2. 
      
…’
The first paragraph of Article states that ‘normal residence’ means ‘the place where a person usually lives, that is for
         at least days in each calendar year, because of personal and occupational ties, or, in the case of a person with no occupational
         ties, because of personal ties which show close links between that person and the place where he is living’.
      
Article 12(3) of Directive 91/provides: 
      
‘The Member States shall assist one another in the implementation of this Directive and shall, if need be, exchange information
         on the licences they have registered.’
      
 The relevant provisions of German law
 The legislation on recognition of driving licences issued by other Member States
Paragraph 28(1), (4) and (5) of the regulation on access to driving on the highways (the regulation on driving licences) (Verordnung
         über die Zulassung von Personen zum Straßenverkehr (Fahrerlaubnis-Verordenung)) of August (BGBl. I, p. 2214,
         ‘the FeV’) provides:
      
‘(1)      Holders of a valid European Union or European Economic Area (“the EEA”) driving licence having their normal residence within
         the meaning of Paragraph 7(1) or (2) in Germany shall be authorised – subject to the restriction laid down in subparagraphs
         (2) to (4) – to drive motor vehicles in that country within the limits of the rights recognised. The conditions attached to
         foreign driving licences shall be observed in Germany also. The provisions of this regulation shall apply to those licences
         save as otherwise provided.
      
…
(4)      The authorisation referred to in subparagraph shall not apply to holders of a [European] Union or EEA driving licence,
…
3.      whose driving licence has, in Germany, been provisionally or definitively withdrawn by act of a court or tribunal or been
         withdrawn by an immediately enforceable or final decision of an administrative authority, or who have been refused a driving
         licence by immediately enforceable decision or whose driving licence has been withdrawn not solely because surrendered in
         the meantime,
      
…
(5)      The right to use an EU or EEA driving licence in Germany after one of the decisions mentioned in subparagraphs 4(3) and (4)
         shall be granted on application when the grounds justifying the withdrawal or prohibition of applying for a new licence no
         longer obtain.’
      
 The rules on withdrawal of a driving licence
According to Paragraph of the Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch), a criminal court is to order the withdrawal of a driving
         licence if it is apparent from the facts of the case that a defendant is unfit to drive a motor vehicle. In accordance with
         Paragraph 69a of that code, when a court orders withdrawal of a licence it is also to order that no application may be made
         for the issue of a new driving licence for a given period (‘the period of the prohibition’) which may vary from six months
         to five years and may even, in some circumstances, be ordered to last for life.
      
By virtue of Article of the FeV, a provision implementing Paragraph of the Law on Road Traffic (the Straßenverkehrsgesetz),
         the driving licence authority is to withdraw the right to drive if it is shown that the holder of a licence is unfit to drive
         motor vehicles. In accordance with Paragraph 46(5), the right to drive is terminated by the act of withdrawal of the driving
         licence. If that licence was issued abroad, its withdrawal extinguishes the right to drive vehicles in Germany.
      
 The rules on fitness to drive
Paragraph of the FeV, headed ‘Fitness’, provides:
      
‘(1)      Applicants for a driving licence must satisfy the relevant physical and mental requirements. In particular, those requirements
         are not satisfied in the case of sickness or disability referred to in Annex or in Annex which excludes fitness [to drive
         motor vehicles] or entails only limited fitness. …
      
(2)      Where circumstances exist which give rise to doubt as to the physical or mental fitness of an applicant for a driving licence,
         the competent authorities may order the applicant to produce a medical report as an inquiry preparatory to the decisions to
         be taken on the issue or extension of a driving licence or on the imposition of restrictions or conditions. ...
      
(3)      Production of a report made by an officially approved centre for the testing of fitness to drive (medical-psychological report)
         may be ordered in order to dispel doubts as to fitness to drive for the purposes of subparagraph [in particular]
      
...
4.      in the case of serious or repeated contraventions of the highway code or of road traffic offences or offences related to fitness
         to drive …
      
or
5.      on the new grant of a driving licence,
…
(b)      when the withdrawal of the licence was based on one of the grounds set out in subparagraph 4.
…
(8)      If the person concerned refuses to be examined or if he does not within the period prescribed produce to the competent driving
         licence authority the medical report required by the latter, the competent authority is entitled to conclude in its decision
         that the person concerned is unfit to drive.’
      
Headed ‘Fitness in cases of alcohol problems’, Paragraph of the FeV gives the competent authorities power to order, in
         certain circumstances, the production of a medical-psychological report for the purposes of inquiries preparatory to the decisions
         to be taken either to issue or extend a driving licence or to impose restrictions or conditions relating to the right to drive.
         That is, in particular, the case when, according to medical opinion or on account of certain facts, there is evidence of abuse
         of alcohol or when road traffic offences have on several occasions been committed under the influence of alcohol.
      
Paragraph 20(1) of the FeV provides that, when a new driving licence is issued following a withdrawal, the same provisions
         apply as for the first issue of a licence. Although, according to Paragraph 20(2) of the FeV, the competent authority may
         decide not to order the tests in relation to the issue of a licence when there is nothing to suggest that the applicant no
         longer possesses the knowledge or fitness required for that purpose, Paragraph 20(3) provides that such a decision does not
         alter the obligation to produce a medical-psychological report laid down in the fifth point of the first paragraph of Paragraph
         11(3) of the FeV.
      
 The disputes in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling
 Case C‑334/Mr Zerche was the holder of a German Democratic Republic driving licence valid for several categories of vehicle. He had that
         licence renewed on August in the form of a secure bank card-type licence.
      
By judgment of January 2003, now final, the Amtsgericht Hainichen (local court of Hainichen) ordered Mr Zerche to pay a
         fine for drunk driving, the material facts dating back to November 2002. Mr Zerche had his authorisation to drive withdrawn
         together with his licence, and was prohibited from applying for a new licence for a period of months ending April 2004.
      
On February Mr Zerche applied for a new Category B driving licence. Failing to present an expert’s report demonstrating
         his fitness to drive, he eventually withdrew his application.
      
On March Mr Zerche was issued with a new Category B driving licence in Ostrov (Czech Republic). In that licence the
         holder is stated to be resident at Mittweida (Germany), where Mr Zerche has lived since January 1996.
      
The Landkreis Mittweida, having been informed of the issue of that licence, ordered Mr Zerche by letter of April to
         present an expert’s report on his fitness to drive motor vehicles. That order not being acted upon, on July the Landkreis
         Mittweida revoked Mr Zerche’s right to use his Czech licence in Germany. 
      
By notice of July the Czech Minister for Transport stated that Mr Zerche’s Czech driving licence was valid. Mr Zerche
         had undergone a medical examination in the Czech Republic before the licence was issued. Moreover, by signing the application
         for a licence, he had certified that he was fit to drive. However, no expert medical-psychological report had been prepared.
      
On the rejection of his complaint challenging the withdrawal decision of July 2005, Mr Zerche brought an action against
         that decision before the Verwaltungsgericht Chemnitz (Administrative Court of Chemnitz), which has decided to stay proceedings
         and to refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling:
      
‘On a proper construction of Article 1(2) in conjunction with Article 8(2) and (4) of Directive [91/439], may a Member State
         refuse to recognise a driving licence issued by another Member State where the person concerned has had a previous driving
         licence withdrawn or cancelled in the first Member State, when the period ordered in connection with that withdrawal or cancellation
         measure during which no new licence was to be issued had expired before the new driving licence was issued by the second Member
         State, and when there are grounds for concluding, on the basis of objective evidence (non-residence in the Member State issuing
         the new driving licence issue or the failure of an application for issue of a new licence in the first Member State), that
         the only reason for acquiring the EU driving licence in the second Member State was to circumvent the strict substantive requirements
         of national procedure [in force in the first Member State] for the issue of a new driving licence, particularly the need for
         a medical/psychological report?’
      
 Case C‑335/Mr Schubert had since held a German Democratic Republic driving licence valid for several categories of vehicle, which
         was renewed on July 1992.
      
By order of May 2002, subsequently become final, the Amtsgericht Marienberg (local court, Marienberg) ordered Mr Schubert
         to pay a fine for drunk driving. He had his authorisation to drive and his driving licence withdrawn and was forbidden to
         obtain a new licence for a period of months ending January 2004.
      
On October Mr Schubert made an application for a new driving licence. Failing to produce an expert’s report demonstrating
         his fitness to drive, he withdrew that application on September 2004.
      
On January Mr Schubert was issued with a new Category B driving licence at Sokolov (Czech Republic). The licence states
         the holder’s residence to be Olbernhau (Germany), where Mr Schubert has lived since October 1998. 
      
Following a general traffic check conducted on April at Olbernhau, the Landkreis Mittlerer Erzgebirgskreis by letter
         of May ordered Mr Schubert to submit an expert’s report on his fitness to drive motor vehicles. There being no response
         to that order, by decision of August the Landkreis Mittlerer Erzgebirgskreis deprived Mr Schubert of his right to use
         his Czech licence in Germany.
      
His complaint against that decision having been rejected, Mr Schubert brought an action before the Verwaltungsgericht Chemnitz,
         which has decided to stay proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:
      
‘(1)      May a Member State, in accordance with Article 1(2) in conjunction with Article 8(2) and (4) of Directive [91/439], require
         the holder of a driving licence issued in another Member State to apply to the administrative authorities of the first Member
         State for recognition of the right to use that licence in its territory when the holder of that licence has previously, in
         the territory of the first Member State, had his driving licence withdrawn or cancelled for some reason?
      
(2)      If not, on a proper construction of Article 1(2) in conjunction with Article 8(2) and (4) of Directive [91/439], may a Member
         State refuse to recognise a driving licence issued by another Member State where the person concerned has had a previous driving
         licence withdrawn or cancelled in the first Member State, when the period ordered in connection with that withdrawal or cancellation
         measure during which no new licence was to be issued had expired before the new driving licence was issued by the second Member
         State, and when there are grounds for concluding, on the basis of objective evidence (non-residence in the Member State issuing
         the new driving licence issue or the failure of an application for issue of a new licence in the first Member State), that
         the only reason for acquiring the European driving licence in the second Member State was to circumvent the strict substantive
         requirements of national procedure [in force in the first Member State] for the issue of a new driving licence, particularly
         the need for a medical/psychological report?’
      
 Case C‑336/Mr Seuke held an old Category driving licence.
      
By enforceable penal order of September 2003, the Amtsgericht Amberg (local court, Amberg) imposed a fine on Mr Seuke for
         drunk driving. He had both his authorisation to drive and his driving licence withdrawn, and was forbidden to apply for a
         new licence before the expiry of a period of months. 
      
Mr Seuke having applied for a new driving licence, the competent authorities required him on March to produce a medical-psychological
         report certifying his fitness to drive. He did not satisfy that requirement and his application was rejected by decision of
         July 2004. 
      
On November when the period ordered by the Amtsgericht Amberg in which it was forbidden to apply for a new licence
         had expired, Mr Seuke, who, it had been ascertained, according to the decision for reference, had been continuously resident
         in Germany since August 1980, was issued with a new Category B driving licence at Ostrov (Czech Republic).
      
On being informed of the issue of that licence, the Landkreis Mittweida ordered Mr Seuke on November to submit an
         expert’s report on his fitness to drive motor vehicles. Mr Seuke not having obeyed that order, by decision of March the Landkreis Mittweida deprived Mr Schubert of the right to use his Czech licence in Germany.
      
His complaint against that decision having been rejected, Mr Seuke brought an action before the Verwaltungsgericht Chemnitz,
         which has decided to stay proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:
      
‘(1)      May a Member State, in accordance with Article 1(2) in conjunction with Article 8(2) and (4) of Directive [91/439], require
         the holder of a driving licence issued in another Member State to apply to the administrative authorities of the first Member
         State for recognition of the right to use that licence in its territory when the holder of that licence has previously, in
         the territory of the first Member State, had his driving licence withdrawn or cancelled for some reason?
      
(2)      If not, on a proper construction of Article 1(2) in conjunction with Article 8(2) and (4) of Directive [91/439], may a Member
         State refuse to recognise a driving licence issued by another Member State where the person concerned has had a previous driving
         licence withdrawn or cancelled in the first Member State, when the period ordered in connection with that withdrawal or cancellation
         measure during which no new licence was to be issued had expired before the new driving licence was issued by the second Member
         State, and when there are grounds for concluding, on the basis of objective evidence (non-residence in the Member State issuing
         the new driving licence issue or the failure of an application for issue of a new licence in the first Member State), that
         the only reason for acquiring the European driving licence in the second Member State was to circumvent the strict substantive
         requirements of national procedure [in force in the first Member State] for the issue of a new driving licence, particularly
         the need for a medical/psychological report?’
      
 Procedure before the Court of Justice
By order of October the President of the Court of Justice ordered that Cases C-334/to C-336/should be joined
         for the purposes of the written and oral procedures and also for judgment.
      
By a series of written questions notified on August 2007, the Court asked the Czech Government about the law of the Czech
         Republic concerning the investigation of the conditions laid down in Article 7(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/and whether
         it is possible to issue a driving licence including an entry indicating the holder’s residence in another Member State and
         also about the criteria applicable in order to ascertain whether a person has his residence in that Member State and whether
         checks are made to establish whether that residence is genuine. 
      
By fax received at the Court Registry on August 2007, the Czech Government stated in response to those questions that the
         condition of normal residence, as laid down by Directive 91/439, was not been introduced into the Czech legal order until
         July 2006. In the period before that date, the Czech rules allowed authorisation to drive to be issued to persons having
         neither a permanent nor a temporary residence in the territory of the Czech Republic.
      
 Concerning the questions referred for a preliminary ruling
The first point to be noted here is that in the procedure laid down by Article EC providing for cooperation between national
         courts and the Court of Justice, it is for the latter to provide the national court with an answer which will be of use to
         it and enable it to determine the case before it. To that end, the Court may have to reformulate the questions referred to
         it. In addition, it is to be borne in mind that the Court has a duty to interpret all provisions of Community law necessary
         to national courts in order to decide the actions pending before them, even if those provisions are not expressly indicated
         in the questions referred to the Court of Justice by those courts (Case C-280/Viessmann [1993] ECR I-971, paragraph 17; Case C‑42/Immobiliare SIF [1997] ECR I‑7089, paragraph 28; and Case C‑45/Campina [2007] ECR I‑2089, paragraphs and 31).
      
Here, having regard to the facts giving rise to the cases in the main proceedings and also to the terms of the observations
         submitted to the Court, examination of the questions raised must take into account Article 7(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/439.
         In order to furnish a reply both helpful and as complete as possible to the questions referred, it is therefore appropriate
         to widen their scope in so far as the national courts have not done so.
      
By its question in Case C‑334/and by the second question in Cases C‑335/and C‑336/06, the referring court has in essence
         sought to ascertain whether Articles 1(2), 7(1)(a) and (b) and 8(2) and (4) of Directive 91/are to be interpreted as preventing
         one Member State (the host Member State) from refusing to recognise in its territory the right to drive stemming from a driving
         licence issued by another Member State (the issuing Member State) to a person and, therefore, the validity of that licence,
         when that person has earlier, in the first Member State, been the object of a measure withdrawing his precious licence for
         driving under the influence of alcohol, and when that person has obtained that licence after any period in which he is forbidden
         to apply for a new licence, but in disregard of the condition of residence or of the conditions of fitness to drive imposed
         by the host Member State in that respect for the purposes of road safety.
      
Those questions may appropriately be examined with the first question in Cases C‑335/and C­336/which seeks, in essence,
         to ascertain whether a host Member State may require the holder of a new driving licence, issued by another Member State,
         to apply for recognition of the right to use that licence in the host Member State, before using the licence, when his previous
         driving licence has been withdrawn or cancelled in that latter State.
      
The first recital in the preamble to Directive 91/states that the general principle of mutual recognition of driving licences
         issued by the Member States, laid down in Article 1(2) of that directive, was established in order to facilitate the movement
         of persons settling in a Member State other than that in which they have passed a driving test (Case C‑476/Kapper [2004] ECR I‑5205, paragraph 71). 
      
The Court has consistently held that Article 1(2) of Directive 91/provides for mutual recognition, without any formality,
         of driving licences issued by Member States. That provision imposes on Member States a clear and precise obligation, which
         leaves no room for discretion as to the measures to be adopted in order to comply with it (judgments in Case C‑230/Awoyemi [1998] ECR I‑6781, paragraphs and 43; Case C‑246/Commission v Netherlands [2003] ECR I‑7485, paragraphs and 61; and Kapper, paragraph 45; orders of April in Case C‑227/Halbritter [2006] ECR I‑0049, and of September in Case C‑340/Kremer [2006] ECR I‑0098).
      
It follows that the host Member State may not impose any formality as a precondition for recognition of a driving licence
         issued by another Member State. It is therefore contrary to that principle of mutual recognition to demand of the holder of
         a driving licence issued by one Member State that he should apply for recognition of that licence in another Member State
         (see, to that effect, Commission v Netherlands, paragraph et seq.).
      
It is for the issuing Member State to investigate whether the minimum conditions imposed by Community law, particularly those
         relating to residence and fitness to drive, have been satisfied and, therefore, whether the issue of a driving licence – as
         the case may be, of a new licence – is justified.
      
Once, therefore, the authorities of one Member State have issued a driving licence in accordance with Article 1(1) of Directive
         91/439, the other Member States are not entitled to investigate whether the conditions for issue laid down by that directive
         have been observed (see, to that effect, the orders in Halbritter, paragraph 34, and Kremer, paragraph 27). The possession of a driving licence issued by one Member State has to be regarded as constituting proof that,
         on the day that licence was issued, its holder fulfilled those conditions (see, to that effect, Commission v Netherlands, paragraph 75, the order of December in Case C-408/Da Silva Carvalho, not published in the ECR, and Kapper, paragraph 46). The fact that, in accordance with point of Annex III to that directive, a Member State may require, for
         any issue of a driving licence, a medical examination stricter than those mentioned in that annex does not, therefore, affect
         that Member State’s duty to recognise driving licences issued by the other Member States in accordance with that directive.
      
It follows, first, that a host Member State making the issue of a driving licence subject to stricter domestic conditions,
         especially after an earlier licence has been withdrawn, may not refuse to recognise a driving licence subsequently issued
         by another Member State solely on the ground that the holder of that new licence has obtained it pursuant to national legislation
         that does not impose the same requirements as the host Member State.
      
Second, it is contrary to the principle of mutual recognition for a host Member State to refuse to recognise a driving licence
         issued by another Member State on the ground that, according to the information supplied by the host Member State, the holder
         of that licence did not, at the date of its issue, satisfy the necessary conditions for obtaining it (see, to that effect,
         the order in Da Silva Carvalho, paragraph 22, and Kapper, paragraph 47).
      
Inasmuch as Directive 91/confers on the issuing Member State exclusive competence to check that driving licences are issued
         in compliance with the requirements imposed by that directive, it is for that Member State alone to take appropriate measures
         in respect of which it is subsequently established that the holders did not satisfy those conditions (see, to that effect,
         the order in Da Silva Carvalho, paragraph 23, and Kapper, paragraph 48).
      
If a Member State has good reason to doubt the validity of a licence issued by another Member State, it must so inform the
         latter under the rules relating to mutual assistance and the exchange of information contained in Article 12(3) of Directive
         91/439. Should the issuing Member State fail to take the appropriate measures, the host Member State may bring proceedings
         against it under Article EC for a declaration by the Court that there has been a failure to fulfil the obligations arising
         under Directive 91/(see, to that effect, the order in Da Silva Carvalho, paragraph 23, and Kapper, paragraph 48).
      
It is true that, for reasons of road traffic safety, as is made clear by the last recital in the preamble to Directive 91/439,
         Article 8(2) and (4) permits the Member States, in certain circumstances, to apply their national provisions on the restriction,
         suspension, withdrawal or cancellation of driving licences to any licence-holder having normal residence in their territory.
      
It is, however, to be borne in mind, first, that that right, as it arises from Article 8(2) of Directive 91/439, may be exercised
         only by reason of some conduct of the person concerned after he has obtained a driving licence issued by another Member State
         (see, to that effect, the orders in Halbritter, paragraph 38, and Kremer, paragraph 35).
      
Second, the first subparagraph of Article 8(4), which authorises a Member State to refuse to recognise the validity of a driving
         licence obtained in another Member State by a person who is, in the first Member State’s territory, the subject of a measure
         restricting, suspending, withdrawing or cancelling a licence, constitutes a derogation from the general principle of mutual
         recognition of driving licences and is, therefore, to be interpreted strictly (see, to that effect, Kapper, paragraphs and 72, and the orders in Halbritter, paragraph 35, and Kremer, paragraph 28).
      
It must at the outset be stressed that, even if that provision enables a Member State, on certain conditions, to refuse recognition
         of a driving licence issued by another Member State, it does not for that reason follow, as the German Government would have
         it, that that the first Member State may make the right to use a licence issued by the second State conditional upon prior
         positive authorisation (see, to that effect, the order in Kremer, paragraph 37).
      
Given that the issuing of a driving licence by a Member State must be effected in compliance with the minimum requirements
         laid down by Directive 91/439, including those set out in Annex III thereto, relating to fitness to drive, an interpretation
         of the first subparagraph of Article 8(4) of that directive to the effect that, in general terms, anyone who has held a driving
         licence that has been withdrawn or cancelled in a Member State may be obliged to appear before the competent authorities of
         that Member State in order to obtain authorisation to make use of the right to drive arising from the driving licence subsequently
         issued in another Member State would run counter to the obligation of mutual recognition without formalities.
      
Nor may that provision be relied on by a Member State to refuse indefinitely to recognise, in relation to a person who has
         been the object in its territory of a measure withdrawing or cancelling a previous licence issued by that State, the validity
         of any licence that may subsequently be issued to him by another Member State (see, to that effect, Kapper, paragraph 76, and the orders in Halbritter, paragraph 27, and Kremer, paragraph 29). To accept that a Member State is entitled to rely on its national provisions in order to refuse indefinitely
         to recognise a licence issued by another Member State would be fundamentally incompatible with the principle of mutual recognition
         of driving licences which is the linchpin of the system established by Directive 91/(Kapper, paragraph 77, and the orders in Halbritter, paragraph 28, and Kremer, paragraph 30).
      
More particularly, the Court has held in paragraph of its order in Kremer that when a person has been the object of a measure withdrawing his driving licence in the territory of a Member State but
         not including a period in which it is prohibited to apply for a new licence, it is contrary to Article 1(2) in conjunction
         with Article 8(2) and (4) of Directive 91/for that Member State to refuse to recognise, in its territory, the right to
         drive stemming from a driving licence subsequently issued in another Member State and, therefore, the validity of that licence,
         so long as the licence-holder has not satisfied the necessary conditions in that first Member State for the issue of a new
         licence following that withdrawal, including the examination of fitness to drive certifying that the grounds justifying the
         withdrawal are no longer in existence.
      
In contrast, it is clear from the foregoing that, when the person concerned has been the object of a measure withdrawing his
         driving licence and prohibiting any application for a new licence for a given period, it is not contrary to Articles 1(2)
         and 8(4) of Directive 91/for a Member State to refuse to recognise a new licence issued by another Member State during
         the period of that prohibition.
      
Similarly, although Article 8(2) of Directive 91/does not permit the Member State of normal residence to refuse to recognise
         a driving licence issued by another Member State just because the holder has earlier had a previous licence withdrawn in the
         Member State of normal residence, that provision does nevertheless allow that State, as recalled in paragraphs and above,
         subject to observance of the principle of territoriality of criminal and police laws, to restrict, suspend, withdraw or cancel
         the new licence if that is warranted, according to the law of the host Member State, by the holder’s conduct after the issue
         of the new licence.
      
In order to answer the questions raised by the national courts, particular consideration must be next be given to the application
         of the principle of mutual recognition, as set out above, when it has established that the new driving licence was issued
         in disregard of the residence condition imposed by Directive 91/439.
      
In this regard, the fourth recital in the preamble to that directive shows that the conditions laid down in order to ensure
         road safety include those contained in Article 7(1)(a) and (b) of that directive, which makes the issue of a driving licence
         conditional upon the requirements relating to fitness to drive and residence, respectively.
      
As remarked by the Commission of the European Communities in its observations, the residence condition helps, inter alia,
         the fight against ‘driving-licence-tourism’, in the absence of complete harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating
         to the issuing of driving licences. Moreover, as the Advocate General has pointed out in paragraph of his Opinion, that
         condition is indispensable if observance of the condition of fitness to drive is to be monitored.
      
Article 7(5) of Directive 91/439, in providing that no person may hold a driving licence from more than one Member State,
         affirms the single nature of a driving licence. So, as a precondition making it possible to establish whether a particular
         candidate has observed the other conditions imposed by the directive, the condition of residence, which determines the Member
         State of issue, assumes special importance in relation to the other conditions laid down by the directive.
      
Road safety might, therefore, be jeopardised if the condition of residence were not observed with regard to someone whose
         right to drive has been restricted, suspended, withdrawn or cancelled for the purposes of Article 8(4) of Directive 91/439.
      
It follows that, when it is possible to determine, not in the light of information supplied by the host Member State but on
         the basis of entries appearing in the driving licence itself or of other incontestable information supplied by the Member
         State of issue, that the condition of residence laid down by Article 7(1)(b) of Directive 91/had not been satisfied when
         that licence was issued, the host Member State, in whose territory the holder of that licence has been the object of a measure
         withdrawing an earlier driving licence, may refuse to recognise the right to drive stemming from the driving licence later
         issued by another Member State following any period in which it is prohibited to apply for a new licence.
      
Having regard to all the foregoing considerations, the answer to be given to the questions referred must be that, on a proper
         construction of Articles 1(2), 7(1) and 8(2) and (4) of Directive 91/439, it is contrary to those provisions for a Member
         State, in circumstances such as those of the cases in the main proceedings, to refuse to recognise in its territory the right
         to drive stemming from a driving licence subsequently issued by another Member State following any period in which the person
         concerned is forbidden to apply for a new licence and therefore, the validity of that licence, so long as the licence-holder
         has not satisfied the necessary conditions in that first Member State for the issue of a new licence following the withdrawal
         of a previous licence, including the examination of fitness to drive certifying that the grounds justifying the withdrawal
         are no longer in existence. In the same circumstances, it is not contrary to those provisions for a Member State to refuse
         to recognise in its territory the right to drive stemming from a driving licence subsequently issued by another Member State,
         if it is established, on the basis of entries appearing in the driving licence itself or of other incontestable information
         supplied by the Member State of issue, that when that licence was issued its holder, who had been the object, in the territory
         of the first Member State, of a measure withdrawing an earlier licence, was not normally resident in the territory of the
         Member State of issue.
      
 Costs
Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court,
         the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs
         of those parties, are not recoverable.
      
On those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:
On a proper construction of Articles 1(2), 7(1) and 8(2) and (4) of Council Directive 91/439/EEC of July on driving
            licences, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1882/of the European Parliament and of the Council of September 2003, it
            is contrary to those provisions for a Member State, in circumstances such as those of the cases in the main proceedings, to
            refuse to recognise in its territory the right to drive stemming from a driving licence subsequently issued by another Member
            State beyond any period in which the person concerned is forbidden to apply for a new licence and, therefore, to recognise
            the validity of that licence, so long as the licence-holder has not satisfied the necessary conditions in that first Member
            State for the issue of a new licence following the withdrawal of a previous licence, including the examination of fitness
            to drive certifying that the grounds justifying the withdrawal are no longer in existence. 
In the same circumstances, it is not contrary to those provisions for a Member State to refuse to recognise in its territory
            the right to drive stemming from a driving licence subsequently issued by another Member State, if it is established, on the
            basis of entries appearing in the driving licence itself or of other incontestable information supplied by the Member State
            of issue, that when that licence was issued its holder, who had been the object, in the territory of the first Member State,
            of a measure withdrawing an earlier licence, was not normally resident in the territory of the Member State of issue.
