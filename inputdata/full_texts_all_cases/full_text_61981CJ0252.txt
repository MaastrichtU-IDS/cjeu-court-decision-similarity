Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT OF OCTOBER , PUBLISHED ON NOVEMBER , IN SO FAR AS IT RELATES TO THE APPOINTMENT OF A . REID TO THE ONLY A POST VACANT , AND IN THE ALTERNATIVE THE APPOINTMENT OF THE APPLICANT TO THAT POST , 
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON SEPTEMBER MRS MARGHERITA HEBRANT , NEE MACEVICIUS , AN OFFICIAL IN GRADE A OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT , BROUGHT AN ACTION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION OF THE PARLIAMENT OF OCTOBER BY WHICH MR REID WAS APPOINTED TO THE VACANT A POST IN THE LIBRARY AND , IN THE ALTERNATIVE , FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF THE APPLICANT TO THAT POST .   THE APPLICANT IS IN CHARGE OF THE CATALOGUING AND LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION DIVISION OF THE LIBRARY OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT WHICH ALSO INCLUDES THE REFERENCE , INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION DIVISION UNDER THE CHARGE OF MR REID . WHEN ALTERATIONS TO THE STRUCTURE OF THOSE TWO DEPARTMENTS WERE BEING PLANNED FOR AND , THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE EUROPEAN     PARLIAMENT REQUESTED CONVERSION OF POSTS FROM GRADE A 5/TO GRADE A FOR THE TWO HEADS OF DIVISION MENTIONED ABOVE , IN PREPARATORY DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE BUDGET AND ORGANIZATION OF THE PARLIAMENT .   HOWEVER , REFERRING TO THE BUDGETARY LIMITS FIXED BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT IN A RESOLUTION OF MAY , THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL FOR RESEARCH AND DOCUMENTATION , WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LIBRARY , FINALLY PROPOSED THAT ONLY THE POST OF HEAD OF THE REFERENCE , INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION DIVISION BE CONVERTED INTO A GRADE A POST .   THE APPLICANT SUBMITTED A COMPLAINT AGAINST THAT PROPOSAL AND BROUGHT AN ACTION WHICH LED TO AN ORDER OF THE COURT , MADE ON NOVEMBER , DISMISSING HER ACTION AS INADMISSIBLE ( CASE 141/( ) ECR ).   IN THE MEANTIME , VACANCY NOTICE NO ADVERTISING THE ABOVE-MENTIONED POST WAS PUBLISHED ON JULY . THE APPLICANT DID NOT APPLY FOR THE POST . HAVING EXAMINED THE FIVE APPLICATIONS WHICH IT RECEIVED , THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY BY DECISION OF OCTOBER APPOINTED MR REID HEAD OF DIVISION IN GRADE A . THE PRESENT ACTION IS DIRECTED AGAINST THAT DECISION . IN ITS DEFENCE , THE PARLIAMENT RAISED AN OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY DIRECTED AGAINST BOTH THE MAIN CLAIM AND THE ALTERNATIVE CLAIM SEEKING THE APPOINTMENT OF THE APPLICANT TO THE POST IN DISPUTE .  ON THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT   IN ESSENCE , THE PARLIAMENT SUBMITS THAT , NOT HAVING APPLIED FOR THE VACANT POST , THE APPLICANT COULD NO LONGER CHALLENGE THE APPOINTMENT OF MR REID . SINCE SHE DID NOT APPLY FOR THE POST , IT MAINTAINS , THE APPOINTMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A MEASURE ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE APPLICANT AND SHE HAS NO INTEREST AT STAKE IN OPPOSING THE APPOINTMENT OF A THIRD PARTY .   THE APPLICANT OBJECTS THAT SINCE THE CONTESTED DECISION ALLOWS A THIRD PARTY TO OBTAIN ADVANTAGES WHICH SHE DOES NOT ENJOY SHE HAS AN INTEREST AT STAKE AND THE DISPUTED MEASURE DOES AFFECT HER ADVERSELY . THE MEASURE IS ALL THE MORE     DETRIMENTAL TO HER BECAUSE IT WAS TAINTED BY PROCEDURAL IRREGULARITIES . IN ESSENCE THESE WERE THAT MR REID WAS THE ONLY CANDIDATE FOR THE A POST IN DISPUTE , AND THAT THE VACANCY NOTICE CONTAINED REQUIREMENTS BASED ON MR REID ' S CURRICULUM VITAE TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT SHE DID NOT HAVE THE REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS , A FACT WHICH , MOREOVER , JUSTIFIED HER FAILURE TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION . SHE FURTHER MAINTAINS THAT EVEN HAD SHE BROUGHT AN ACTION AFTER HAVING SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION , THE PARLIAMENT WOULD HAVE RETREATED BEHIND THE NOTION OF THE INTERESTS OF THE SERVICE IN ORDER TO REJECT IT .   IT IS APPROPRIATE TO RECALL IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT IN THE ORDER OF NOVEMBER THE PRESIDENT OF THE THIRD CHAMBER DECLARED THAT VACANCY NOTICE NO COULD NOT NOW BE THE SUBJECT OF AN ACTION BECAUSE IT HAD NOT BEEN THE SUBJECT OF A PREVIOUS COMPLAINT ON THE PART OF THE APPLICANT . CONSEQUENTLY , THE APPLICANT ' S MAIN ARGUMENT , BY WHICH SHE MAINTAINS THAT THE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY THAT NOTICE DEPRIVED HER OF THE APPOINTMENT TO THE DISPUTED GRADE A POST , IS NO LONGER OPEN TO HER .   IN ADDITION IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT FROM THE DATE OF THE PUBLICATION OF THE VACANCY NOTICE THE APPOINTMENT PROCEDURE FOLLOWED ITS NORMAL COURSE , THAT FIVE CANDIDATES APPLIED AND THAT MR REID FULFILLED THE CONDITIONS REQUIRED BY THE VACANCY NOTICE .   SINCE THE APPLICANT VOLUNTARILY DECIDED NOT TO APPLY FOR THE POST , AND THUS REFUSED TO TAKE PART IN THE APPOINTMENT PROCEDURE , SHE CANNOT NOW CHALLENGE THE APPOINTMENT OF A THIRD PARTY , AND CONSEQUENTLY HER APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF MR REID ' S APPOINTMENT IS INADMISSIBLE .  ON THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE ALTERNATIVE CLAIM   SINCE THE PRINCIPAL CLAIM IS INADMISSIBLE , THE ALTERNATIVE CLAIM SEEKING THE APPOINTMENT OF THE APPLICANT TO THE DISPUTED A POST MUST LIKEWISE BE INADMISSIBLE BECAUSE IT IS APPARENT THAT THAT POST IS PROPERLY OCCUPIED BY MR REID AND THAT HIS APPOINTMENT CAN NO LONGER BE CHALLENGED BY THE APPLICANT .       CONSEQUENTLY , THE ACTION MUST BE DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE .
