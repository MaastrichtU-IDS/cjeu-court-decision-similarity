IN CASE 295/PARTI ECOLOGISTE ( ECOLOGIST PARTY ) ' ' LES VERTS ' ' , A NON-PROFIT-MAKING ASSOCIATION ,   APPLICANT ,   V  EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ,   DEFENDANT ,   
Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION OF THE NULLITY OF : THE DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT DATED OCTOBER AMENDING AND ADOPTING THE GENERAL BUDGET OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ; AND  THE DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT DATED AND DECEMBER AMENDING AND ADOPTING THE GENERAL BUDGET OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR AT ITS SECOND READING .  
Grounds
. BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON DECEMBER , THE PARTI ECOLOGISTE ' ' LES VERTS ' ' , A NON-PROFIT-MAKING ASSOCIATION , BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION OF THE NULLITY OF THE DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT DATED OCTOBER AMENDING AND ADOPTING THE GENERAL BUDGET OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR AND THE DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT DATED AND DECEMBER AMENDING AND ADOPTING THE GENERAL BUDGET OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR AT ITS SECOND READING .  . THE APPLICANT CONTESTS THOSE MEASURES IN SO FAR AS THEY APPROVE A BUDGET HEADING ALLOCATING APPROPRIATIONS TO ' ' THE COSTS OF PREPARATIONS FOR THE NEXT EUROPEAN ELECTIONS ' ' . THE HEADING AT ISSUE IS ITEM , WHICH FORMS PART OF THE SECTION OF THE BUDGET RELATING TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT . IT FIRST APPEARED IN THE BUDGET FOR . IT IS ACCOMPANIED BY A REMARK , TO THE EFFECT THAT ' ' THIS APPROPRIATION IS TO COVER A CONTRIBUTION TO THE COST OF PREPARATIONS FOR THE INFORMATION CAMPAIGN LEADING UP TO THE SECOND DIRECT ELECTIONS IN PURSUANT TO THE DECISION ( OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ' S BUREAU ) OF OCTOBER ' ' .  . BY VIRTUE OF ARTICLE OF THE FINANCIAL REGULATION OF DECEMBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), THE PARLIAMENT HAS THE POWER TO IMPLEMENT THE SECTION OF THE BUDGET RELATING TO IT . THE APPLICANT FEARS THAT IT MAY USE THAT POWER TO BENEFIT THE PARTIES REPRESENTED IN THE PARLIAMENT ELECTED IN TO THE DETRIMENT OF THOSE NOT SO REPRESENTED , WHEN IT COMES TO REIMBURSE THE EXPENDITURE INCURRED IN THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN . THAT APPREHENSION IS BASED ON A DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ' S BUREAU DATED SEPTEMBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , C , P . ) - WHICH     REPLACES THAT OF OCTOBER - ADOPTING RULES GOVERNING THE USE OF THE APPROPRIATIONS ENTERED UNDER ITEM OF THE GENERAL BUDGET OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES . UNDER THOSE RULES , 31% OF THE APPROPRIATIONS ARE TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE POLITICAL GROUPINGS WHICH TOOK PART IN THE EUROPEAN ELECTIONS , AND THE REMAINING 69% ARE TO BE SHARED AMONGST THE PARTIES REPRESENTED IN THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ELECTED IN .   . BY AN APPLICATION ON A PROCEDURAL ISSUE MADE UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE , THE PARLIAMENT RAISED AN OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY AND REQUESTED THE COURT TO DECIDE ON THAT OBJECTION WITHOUT EXAMINING THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CASE .  . WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT THOSE OF ITS MEASURES WHICH ARE IN THE NATURE OF DECISIONS MAY BE THE SUBJECT OF AN ACTION FOR A DECLARATION OF NULLITY , THE PARLIAMENT SUBMITS THAT THE MEASURES IT IS CALLED UPON TO TAKE IN THE COURSE OF PROCEDURE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE BUDGET ARE NOT OF DIRECT AND INDIVIDUAL CONCERN TO THE APPLICANT .  . IN ITS APPLICATION , THE APPLICANT ARGUES THAT THE CONTESTED DECISIONS ARE OF DIRECT AND INDIVIDUAL CONCERN TO IT , ON THE GROUND THAT THEIR EFFECT IS TO GIVE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO RIVAL POLITICAL PARTIES .  . THAT ARGUMENT CANNOT BE ACCEPTED . ARTICLE ( ) OF THE FINANCIAL REGULATION OF DECEMBER DEFINES THE BUDGET AS ' ' THE INSTRUMENT WHICH SETS OUT FORECASTS OF , AND AUTHORIZES IN ADVANCE , THE EXPECTED REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE OF THE COMMUNITIES FOR EACH YEAR ' ' . THE PROCEDURE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE BUDGET LEADS ONLY TO THE AUTHORIZATION OF THE COMMITMENT OF EXPENDITURE . THEREFORE A NATURAL OR LEGAL PERSON CANNOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BE DIRECTLY CONCERNED BY THE STEPS IN THAT PROCEDURE . SUCH A PERSON MAY BE DIRECTLY CONCERNED ONLY BY THE MEASURES TAKEN TO IMPLEMENT THE BUDGET .  . SINCE THE DOCUMENTS BEFORE THE COURT CONTAIN ALL THE INFORMATION REQUIRED IN ORDER TO GIVE A DECISION ON THE APPLICATION , IT HAS NOT BEEN CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO HEAR THE ORAL ARGUMENT OF THE PARTIES . IN CONSEQUENCE IT MUST BE HELD , PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY AND ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE , THAT THE APPLICATION HAS BEEN MADE BY A LEGAL PERSON NOT DIRECTLY CONCERNED BY THE CONTESTED MEASURES AND IS THEREFORE INADMISSIBLE .
