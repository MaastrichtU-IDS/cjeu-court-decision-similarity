Judgment
By its appeal, the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) asks the Court to set aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of June 2015, Deluxe Laboratories v OHIM (deluxe) (T‑222/14, EU:T:2015:364, ‘the judgment under appeal’), by which the Court annulled the decision of the Second Board of Appeal of EUIPO of January (R 1250/2013-2), having dismissed the action brought by Deluxe Laboratories, Inc., which subsequently became Deluxe Entertainment Services Group, Inc. (‘Deluxe’), against the decision of the examiner who had refused to register the figurative sign ‘deluxe’ as an EU trade mark (‘decision at issue’).
Legal context
Council Regulation (EC) No 207/of February on the European Union trade mark (OJ L 78, p. 1) provides in Article 7, which is headed ‘Absolute grounds for refusal’:
‘1.   The following shall not be registered:
…
(b)
trade marks which are devoid of any distinctive character;
…
2.   Paragraph shall apply notwithstanding that the grounds of non-registrability obtain in only part of the Union’.
Article of that regulation provides:
‘Decisions of [EUIPO] shall state the reasons on which they are based. They shall be based only on reasons or evidence on which the parties concerned have had an opportunity to present their comments’.
Background to the dispute
The General Court summarised in paragraphs to of the judgment under appeal the facts giving rise to the dispute as follows:

5.
By decision of June 2013, the examiner refused the application in relation to all the goods and services referred to in paragraph above, in accordance with Article 7(1)(b) and (c) of Regulation No 207/2009, on the grounds that the mark applied for, first, lacked distinctive character and, second, informed consumers about the quality of the goods and services concerned.
6.
On July 2013, [Deluxe] filed a notice of appeal with [EUIPO], pursuant to Articles to of Regulation No 207/2009, against the examiner’s decision.
7.
By [the decision at issue], the Second Board of Appeal of [EUIPO] (‘the Board of Appeal’) upheld the examiner’s decision. It held, inter alia, that, in the parts of the European Union where English is understood, the word element ‘deluxe’ is not on its own capable of distinguishing the applicant’s goods and services from those of its competitors, for it is a form of commonplace promotional tag and merely consists of a “claim of superior quality”. It added that the term ‘deluxe’ falls within the category of terms that must be excluded from trade mark monopoly and that the figurative element at issue was not sufficient to confer distinctive character on the mark applied for. On those same grounds, the Board of Appeal upheld the examiner’s decision in so far as he had held that the mark applied for informs consumers about the quality of the goods and services concerned. The Board of Appeal also held that that mark had not acquired distinctive character through use in the European Union.’
The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal
By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on April 2014, Deluxe brought an action for the annulment of the decision at issue.
In support of its action, Deluxe raised five pleas in law, alleging infringement of the duty to state reasons, Article 7(1)(b), (c) and (3) of Regulation No 207/2009, as well as the principle of protection of legitimate expectations, acquired rights and the lawfulness of Community acts, respectively.
Deluxe argued that the Board of Appeal had not given reasons for the refusal to register the mark at issue in the light of each of the goods and services at issue. It stated inter alia that that Board had taken no account of the characteristics of each of those goods and services, although it was an essential factor in order to determine the fanciful, suggestive or allusive nature of the word ‘deluxe’.
EUIPO contended that it followed from the expression ‘without exception’, used in the decision at issue, that the Board of Appeal had carried out an individual assessment of the goods and services at issue, and that it was able to rely on a general statement of reasons since all those goods and services concerned the audiovisual sector.
The General Court upheld Deluxe’s action.
After having referred, in paragraphs to of the judgment under appeal, to the case-law of the Court of Justice, the General Court noted, in paragraphs to of that judgment, that, in the present case, having regard to the description of over goods and services, included in eight different classes and relating to different fields, those goods and services display such differences given their nature, their characteristics, their intended use and the way in which they are marketed that they cannot be considered as a homogenous category making it possible for the Board of Appeal to adopt a general reasoning. The Board of Appeal did not indicate that the goods and services at issue had a sufficiently direct and specific link to each other so as to form a homogenous category (‘the required link’).
As the General Court noted in paragraph of the judgment under appeal, the Board of Appeal refers, in general terms, to ‘the goods and services’, ‘all the goods and services’ and to ‘the goods and services at issue’, but it does not refer specifically to any of the goods and services in the classes concerned, or to categories or groups thereof. Accordingly, the General Court held, in paragraph of the judgment under appeal, that, by omitting to consider the distinctive character of the mark applied for, for each of the goods and services at issue, the Board of Appeal did not carry out the specific assessment required in Article 7(1)(b) of Regulation No 207/in relation to the goods and services in the classes concerned and did not state reasons to the requisite legal standard in relation to the decision at issue in that respect.
In the context of considering EUIPO’s arguments, the General Court stated, in paragraph of the judgment under appeal, that it does not follow, even indirectly, from the expression ‘without exception’ that the Board of Appeal assessed the distinctive character of the mark applied for in the light of all the goods and services at issue. As the Court observed, the Board of Appeal merely indicated in the decision at issue that all the goods, without exception, can be presented as being of superior quality and that all the services, without exception, can be presented as providing such quality. It did not indicate that the goods and services in the classes concerned have the required link and, accordingly, did not mention any element of such a kind as to explain the recourse to a general reasoning.
As for EUIPO’s argument that the goods and services at issue were directly linked to the audiovisual sector, the General Court noted, in paragraph of the judgment under appeal, that that finding does not appear in the decision at issue. Moreover, the General Court denied the existence of the required link between certain goods and services, such as motion pictures, delivery of goods by truck, warehouse storage and warehousing services, product research and development services as well as hosting and design of websites for others. It found that, in any event, the existence of such a link is not apparent from the wording of the decision at issue. Finally, the General Court considered that the fact, supposing it were established, that the word ‘deluxe’ amounts to a laudatory and promotional term capable of applying to all the goods and services at issue has no bearing in that regard.
Consequently, the General Court annulled the decision at issue.
The forms of order sought
By its appeal, EUIPO claims that the Court should:
—
set aside the judgment under appeal;
—
order the applicant before the General Court to pay the costs of the proceedings.
The appeal
By its appeal, EUIPO raises a single ground for appeal, alleging infringement of the first sentence of Article of Regulation No 207/2009, in conjunction with Article 7(1)(b) and (2) of that regulation. This ground is divided into two parts.
Arguments of the parties
By the first part of its single ground for appeal, EUIPO complains that the General Court erred in law by restricting the possibility of adopting a general reasoning only to the situation in which the goods and services form homogenous categories. EUIPO considers that the General Court cannot rule out the possibility of carrying out a general reasoning in relation to diverse goods and services where the perception of the sign in respect of each of them is uniform and, therefore, the reasoning which applies to them remains invariable.
Thus, according to EUIPO, it is sufficient that the goods and services designated by the application for registration have a common characteristic for a general reasoning to be allowed in respect to them. That common characteristic is that, for each of the goods and services covered, the suggestion of high quality is perceived as a mere sales argument. In the present case, the sign ‘deluxe’ conveys, in the same way for all those goods and services, a laudatory and promotional message incapable of allowing the public to identify the origin of those goods and services. In support of its line of argument, EUIPO relies on the reasoning adopted by the Court in the order of December 2014, FTI Touristik v OHIM (C‑253/P, not published, EU:C:2014:2445), in which the Court recognised that there was a sufficiently direct and specific link between the goods and services concerned in the light of a common feature which consisted of the fact that all the goods and services could be the subject of discounts or special benefits.
Therefore, EUIPO considers that the finding in paragraph of the judgment under appeal that the Board of Appeal did not carry out the concrete assessment required, having failed to identify homogeneity between all the goods and services, is erroneous.
Similarly, EUIPO argues that the Court made an error in law by dismissing, in paragraph of the judgment under appeal, as irrelevant, the Board of Appeal’s finding that the term ‘deluxe’ is a laudatory and promotional term capable of applying to all the goods and services at issue.
Deluxe contends that EUIPO relied to a large extent on the BigXtra case which gave rise to the order of December 2014, FTI Touristik v OHIM (C‑253/P, not published, EU:C:2014:2445), in which the registration of the mark ‘BigXtra’ had been refused on the ground that the term was clearly laudatory. Deluxe argues that that case is not relevant because it is distinguishable from the present case. The term ‘deluxe’ can be descriptive or laudatory only in relation to the goods themselves and not in relation to the way in which they are sold, since there is no ‘deluxe’ way of selling a product, especially if the relevant public is taken into account.
By the second part of its single ground for appeal, EUIPO submits that the General Court’s interpretation of a requirement of sufficient homogeneity, in paragraphs to and of the judgment under appeal, which allows the Board of Appeal to adopt a general reasoning for refusing the application for registration of the mark at issue, does not comply with the case-law, in particular the order of March 2010, CFCMCEE v OHIM (C‑282/P, EU:C:2010:153). By establishing a correlation between the existence of a ‘homogeneous category’ and the description of the goods and services, the General Court erroneously interprets the concept of ‘sufficiently homogeneous’‘category’ or ‘group’ of goods or services within the meaning of that case-law and, consequently, the concept of ‘a sufficiently direct and specific link’ that must exist between the goods and services.
According to EUIPO, the requirement of sufficient homogeneity should be understood in a broader way so that it is sufficient that the goods and services all display a common characteristic, which could also exist between goods or services in different sectors.
EUIPO claims that, in the present case, the decision at issue indicates clearly that the common characteristic of the goods and services at issue is that all the goods, without exception, can be presented as being of superior quality and all the services, without exception, can be presented as providing such quality.
Deluxe challenges EUIPO’s assertion that the goods and services at issue are sufficiently homogenous and can, thereby, be considered a single group.
Findings of the Court
Given that EUIPO disputes the General Court’s assessments referred to in paragraphs to of the present judgment and that the two parts of the single ground for appeal allege infringement of Article 7(1)(b) and Article of Regulation No 207/2009, these parts should be examined together.
As a preliminary point, it is apparent from settled case-law that the competent authority cannot merely carry out a minimal assessment of an application for registration, but it must, on the contrary, carry out a stringent and full examination in order to prevent trade marks from being improperly registered (judgment of May 2003, Libertel, C‑104/01, EU:C:2003:244, paragraph 59).
Since registration of a mark is always sought for goods or services specified in the application for registration, the question whether registration can be refused on one of the absolute grounds must be assessed on the facts by reference to those goods or services (judgment of February 2007, BVBA Management, Training en Consultancy, C‑239/05, EU:C:2007:99, paragraph 31).
It must be recalled that, according to the Court’s case-law, first, the examination of the absolute grounds for refusal must be carried out in relation to each of the goods or services for which trade mark registration is sought and, secondly, that the decision by which the competent authority refuses registration of a mark must, in principle, state reasons in respect of each of those goods or services (judgment of February 2007, BVBA Management, Training en Consultancy, C‑239/05, EU:C:2007:99, paragraph 34, and order of March 2010, CFCMCEE v OHIM, C‑282/P, EU:C:2010:153, paragraph 37).
However, as regards that last requirement, the Court has stated that the competent authority may use only general reasoning for all of the goods and services concerned where the same ground for refusal is given for a category or group of goods or services (judgments of February 2007, BVBA Management, Training en Consultancy, C‑239/05, EU:C:2007:99, paragraph 37, and of October 2013, Isdin v Bial-Portela, C‑597/P, EU:C:2013:672, paragraph 26).
The Court then made clear that such a power extends only to goods and services which are interlinked in a sufficiently direct and specific way, to the point where they form a sufficiently homogeneous category or group of goods or services (judgment of October 2013, Isdin v Bial-Portela, C‑597/P, EU:C:2013:672, paragraph 27).
In order to determine whether the goods and services covered by an application for registration of an EU mark are interlinked in a sufficiently direct and specific way and can be placed in sufficiently homogenous categories and groups, for the purposes of the case-law cited in the previous paragraph, account must be taken of the fact that the objective of that exercise is to enable and facilitate the assessment in concreto of the question whether or not the mark concerned by the application for registration comes under one of the absolute grounds for refusal, in accordance with the case-law cited in paragraph of the present judgment.
Accordingly, the placement of the goods and services at issue in one or more groups or categories must be carried out in particular on the basis of the characteristics which are common to them and which are relevant for the analysis of whether or not a specific absolute ground for refusal may apply to the mark applied for in respect of those goods and services. It follows that such an assessment must be carried out in concreto for the examination of each application for registration and, as the case may be, for each of the different absolute grounds for refusal which may apply.
It follows from the foregoing considerations that it cannot be ruled out a priori that the goods and services covered by an application for registration all present a relevant characteristic for the analysis of an absolute ground for refusal and that they can be placed, for the purposes of examining the application for registration at issue in relation to that absolute ground for refusal, in a sufficiently homogenous single category or group, for the purposes of the case-law cited in paragraph of the present judgment.
In the present case, it is apparent from paragraph of the judgment under appeal that, in relation to all the goods and services covered by the application for registration at issue, the Board of Appeal indicated that all the goods, without exception, can be presented as being of superior quality, and all the services, without exception, can be presented as providing superior quality. It follows from that consideration that the Board of Appeal, in essence, considered that all the goods and services covered by the application for registration under examination presented a characteristic which was relevant to the analysis of the absolute ground for refusal under Article 7(1)(b) of Regulation No 207/2009, namely the fact that they could be presented as having or providing superior quality and that, therefore, they were all part of a sufficiently homogenous single category or group, for the purposes of the analysis of that absolute ground for refusal. The relevance, according to the Board of Appeal, of that common characteristic of the goods and services at issue for the purposes of the analysis that it had to carry out is demonstrated by the finding in the decision at issue that the mark applied for consisted of a ‘claim of superior quality’.
The Board of Appeal’s failure, mentioned in paragraph of the judgment under appeal, to expressly indicate that the goods and services at issue had such a sufficiently direct and specific link to each other to the point that they form a homogenous category cannot lead to a different conclusion, since such an indication was implicit from the Board’s consideration referred to in paragraph of the judgment under appeal.
It was for the General Court, in order to check observance of the Board of Appeal’s obligation to carry out to the specific assessment required by Article 7(1)(b) of Regulation No 207/and to give sufficient reasons to the requisite standard, to examine, in the context of a factual assessment, the merits of the Board of Appeal’s considerations noted in paragraph of the present judgment.
In particular, it was for the General Court, first, to check whether the mark applied for, which is composed of a word element and a figurative element, was indeed capable of being perceived, directly and immediately, as a claim of superior quality or a laudatory message by the relevant public rather than as an indication of the commercial origin of the goods and services it designates.
Second, it was for the General Court to check, in the context of the analysis of the word element of the mark applied for, whether the term ‘deluxe’ did actually convey the concept of ‘superior quality’ as claimed by the Board of Appeal, given that that word element amounts to a direct reference to the concept of ‘luxury’. If the term ‘deluxe’ were to have a meaning distinct to that of ‘superior quality’, as considered by the Advocate General in paragraph to of his Opinion, the General Court would then have to examine whether or not, in the light of that meaning, the goods and services covered by the mark at issue constitute a homogenous group justifying recourse to a general reasoning.
However, the General Court ruled out generally the possibility of finding the goods and services at issue to be homogenous and it did not take into account, in that regard, the specificity of the mark applied for or, in particular, of its perception by the relevant public.
Indeed, as is apparent from paragraph of the judgment under appeal, the General Court merely found that the goods and services covered by the application for registration at issue displayed such differences as regards their nature, their characteristics, their intended use and the way in which they are marketed that they could not be considered a homogenous category enabling the Board of Appeal to adopt a general reasoning with respect to them. The General Court therefore failed to have regard to the possibility that, despite their differences, all the goods and services at issue could have a common characteristic, relevant to the analysis that the Board of Appeal had to carry out, which, in accordance with the considerations set out in paragraphs and of the present judgment, could justify their placement within a single homogenous group and the use by the Board of Appeal of a general reasoning in relation to them.
For the same reasons, the Court’s assertion, in paragraph of the judgment under appeal, that ‘the fact that the term “deluxe” amounts to a laudatory and promotional term capable of applying to all the goods and services at issue is without consequence’ is also erroneous.
It follows from the foregoing that the General Court erred in law in interpreting Article 7(1)(b) and Article of Regulation No 207/2009, with the result that the judgment under appeal must be set aside.
In accordance with the first paragraph of Article of the Statute of the Court of Justice, the latter may, after setting aside the decision of the General Court, itself give final judgment in the matter, where the state of the proceedings so permits, or refer the case back to the General Court for judgment. In the present case, the state of the proceedings does not permit the Court to give final judgment.
The case should therefore be referred back to the General Court and the costs reserved.
 
On those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby:
 
1.
Sets aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of June 2015, Deluxe Laboratories v OHIM (deluxe) (T‑222/14, not published, EU:T:2015:364);
 
2.
Refers the case back to the General Court of the European Union;
 
3.
Reserves the costs.
