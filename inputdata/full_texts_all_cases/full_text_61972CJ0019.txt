Subject of the case
APPLICATION, AT THE PRESENT STAGE OF THE PROCEDURE, CONCERNING THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION SEEKING ANNULMENT OF A DECISION WHICH THE APPLICANT CONSIDERS TO FLOW FROM THE COMMISSION' S LETTER OF FEBRUARY REFUSING HIM FOUR - INSTEAD OF TWO - MONTHS' SALARY BY WAY OF RESETTLEMENT ALLOWANCE, 
Grounds
I - ADMISSIBILITY  THE APPLICATION WHICH WAS LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON MAY SEEKS, FIRST, THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION WHICH THE APPLICANT CONSIDERS TO FLOW FROM THE LETTER OF FEBRUARY BY WHICH THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL FOR PERSONNEL AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE COMMISSION REJECTED THE APPLICANT' S REQUEST FOR A RESETTLEMENT ALLOWANCE EQUAL TO FOUR AND NOT MERELY TWO MONTHS OF HIS LAST BASIC SALARY . THE APPLICATION ALSO SEEKS AN ORDER DIRECTING THE COMMISSION TO PAY THE APPLICANT, BY WAY OF THIS ALLOWANCE, A SUM CORRESPONDING TO TWO MONTHS OF THE SAID SALARY .  IN ITS STATEMENT ON THE PROCEDURAL ISSUE THE COMMISSION HAS CONTENDED THAT THE APPLICATION IS INADMISSABLE ON THE GROUND THAT IT IS OUT OF TIME BECAUSE THE LETTER OF FEBRUARY MERELY CONFIRMED THE DECISION CONVEYED IN THE LETTER OF JUNE BY WHICH THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL, FOR THE FIRST TIME, REJECTED THE APPLICANT' S REQUEST . THE APPLICANT IS SAID TO HAVE FAILED TO CONTEST THAT DECISION BEFORE THE COURT WITHIN THE PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS LAID DOWN BY ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS . THE COMMISSION ASSERTS THAT THE ACTION IS ALSO INADMISSIBLE EVEN IF IT IS FOUND THAT THE LETTER OF JULY 1971, BY WHICH THE APPLICANT REQUESTED THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL TO RECONSIDER HIS ATTITUDE, CONSTITUTED A COMPLAINT WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS . IN FACT, IN THE COMMISSION' S OPINION, IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS, THE COMPLAINT MUST THEN BE REGARDED AS HAVING BEEN THE SUBJECT OF AN IMPLIED DECISION OF REJECTION TAKEN AT THE END OF A PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS FROM THE DAY ON WHICH THE COMPLAINT WAS LODGED AND THE APPLICANT, ON PAIN OF BEING TIME-BARRED, SHOULD HAVE CONTESTED THE DECISION WITHIN A FURTHER PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS, IN OTHER WORDS, BY MID-NOVEMBER AT THE LATEST .  THE OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY MUST BE JUDGED ON THE BASIS OF ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS IN THE FORM IN WHICH THEY WERE IN FORCE WHEN THE ABOVEMENTIONED LETTERS WERE WRITTEN - HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO RESPECTIVELY AS " THE FORMER ARTICLE " AND " THE FORMER ARTICLE " - THAT IS, WITHOUT TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE AMENDMENTS INTRODUCED BY ARTICLES AND OF REGULATION ( EURATOM, ECSC, EEC ) NO 1473/OF THE COUNCIL, OF JUNE ( OJ, ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION 1972, P . ) WHICH, ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF ARTICLE OF THAT REGULATION, ENTERED INTO FORCE ONLY ON JULY .  BECAUSE IT REJECTED THE APPLICANT' S REQUEST OF MAY 1971, THE LETTER OF JUNE CONSTITUTED AN ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING HIM WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE FORMER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS . THE APPLICANT THEREFORE HAD THE CHOICE EITHER OF LODGING AN APPLICATION DIRECTLY WITHIN THE PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS LAID DOWN BY THE FIRST SUBPARAGRAPH OF THE FORMER ARTICLE ( ) OR OF CONSERVING THE RIGHT OF APPEAL BY SUBMITTING TO THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY, WITHIN THAT PERIOD AND PURSUANT TO THE FORMER ARTICLE OF THE SAME STAFF REGULATIONS, A COMPLAINT AGAINST THE MEASURE TAKEN IN THIS REGARD . HE IN FACT MADE USE OF THE SECOND POSSIBILITY BY HIS LETTER OF JULY WHICH MUST BE REGARDED AS A COMPLAINT WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE FORMER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS SINCE IT CLEARLY SOUGHT A DECISION REVERSING THAT CONVEYED IN THE LETTER OF JUNE .  UNDER THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF THE FORMER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS " WHERE THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY TAKES NO DECISION IN RESPECT OF A REQUEST OR A COMPLAINT ... WITHIN TWO MONTHS FROM THE DATE ON WHICH IT WAS LODGED, THIS SHALL BE DEEMED TO CONSTITUTE AN IMPLIED DECISION REJECTING IT ", AND : " AN APPEAL AGAINST SUCH DECISION SHALL BE LODGED WITHIN A FURTHER TWO MONTHS ". CONSEQUENTLY, SINCE THE COMMISSION DID NOT GIVE A DECISION ON THE COMPLAINT WITHIN A PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS, IT WAS DEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN AN IMPLIED DECISION REJECTING IT IN SEPTEMBER WHICH THE APPLICANT DID NOT CONTEST WITHIN THE SECOND PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS MENTIONED ABOVE, IN OTHER WORDS, IN NOVEMBER AT THE LATEST .  ALTHOUGH THIS APPLICATION, WHICH IS DIRECTED AGAINST THE EXPRESS DECISION OF REJECTION OF FEBRUARY 1972, WAS BROUGHT IN DUE TIME, THAT DECISION WAS HOWEVER MERELY IN CONFIRMATION OF THE IMPLIED DECISION MENTIONED ABOVE AND OF THE LETTER OF JUNE AND, CONSEQUENTLY, WAS NOT CAPABLE OF RE-OPENING THE PERIOD FOR LODGING AN APPLICATION . IT CANNOT BE OBJECTED IN THIS CASE THAT THE DECISION OF FEBRUARY CONTAINS NEW CONSIDERATIONS OF LAW OR FACT RELATING TO THE SITUATION AT THE TIME OF THE IMPLIED DECISION OF REJECTION ON THE GROUND THAT THE COMMISSION, TO JUSTIFY ITS ATTITUDE, ADVANCED IN THAT DECISION ARGUMENTS SUPPLEMENTING THOSE WHICH IT HAD ALREADY ADDUCED IN ITS LETTER OF JUNE . IN THIS CONNEXION, IT SUFFICES TO NOTE THAT THE COMMISSION DID NOT AT ANY TIME DESIST FROM ITS ARGUMENT THAT THE APPLICANT' S REQUEST WAS UNFOUNDED .  THE APPLICANT HAS ALSO OBJECTED THAT THE DEFENDANT CANNOT IN GOOD FAITH RELY ON THE EXPIRY OF THE PERIOD LAID DOWN IN THE FORMER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS SINCE THIS WOULD ALLOW IT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ITS OWN NEGLIGENCE IN NOT REPLYING TO THE LETTER OF JULY UNTIL MORE THAN SEVEN MONTHS HAD ELAPSED .  THIS ARGUMENT DISREGARDS THE FACT THAT THE PERIOD IN QUESTION IS UNCONDITIONAL, THAT, IN PARTICULAR, IT THEREFORE APPLIES WITHOUT ITS BEING NECESSARY TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE PROLONGED SILENCE OF THE INSTITUTION CONSTITUTES NEGLIGENCE ON ITS PART .  THE APPLICATION IS THEREFORE INADMISSIBLE .  
Decision on costs

HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, IN PROCEEDINGS COMMENCED BY SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES, INSTITUTIONS SHALL BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .
