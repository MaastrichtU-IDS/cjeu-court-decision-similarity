Case C-522/Commission of the European Communities
v
Kingdom of Belgium
(Failure of a Member State to fulfil obligations – Freedom of movement for persons – Freedom of movement for workers – Freedom to provide services – Freedom of establishment – Free movement of capital – Articles 28, 31, and of the Agreement on the European Economic Area – Directive 2002/83/EC – Tax legislation providing for less favourable treatment of contributions to occupational pension schemes paid to insurance
         undertakings established abroad – Taxation in Belgium of capital and surrender values paid to beneficiaries who have transferred their residence abroad – Tax convention preventing double taxation – Representative responsible)
      
Opinion of Advocate General Stix-Hackl delivered on October Judgment of the Court (Second Chamber), July Summary of the Judgment
1.     Member States – Obligations – Failure to fulfil obligations – Maintenance of a national provision incompatible with Community
            law 
2.     Freedom of movement for persons – Workers – Freedom of establishment – Freedom to provide services – Citizens of the European
            Union – Restrictions – Tax legislation 
(Arts EC, EC, EC and EC; EEA Agreement, Arts 28, and 36; European Parliament and Council Directive 2002/83,
            Art. 5(1); Council Directive 92/96, Art. 4)
1.     Even if, in practice, the authorities of a Member State do not apply a national provision which is at variance with Community
         law, the principle of legal certainty nevertheless requires that that provision be amended.
      
(see para. 70)
2.     A Member State which:
– makes the tax-deductibility of employers’ insurance contributions due under a supplementary pension and life assurance scheme
         subject to the condition that those contributions be paid to an insurance undertaking or welfare fund established in that
         Member State;
      
– makes tax reduction for long-term savings, granted for personal supplementary pension and life assurance contributions and
         premiums paid in the form of deductions made by the employer from the employee’s remuneration, or in the form of deductions
         made by the undertaking from the remuneration of a director who is not under a contract of employment, subject to the condition
         that those contributions and premiums be paid to an insurance undertaking or welfare fund established in that Member State;
      
– provides that, when capital, surrender values and savings are paid or allocated to a taxpayer who has previously transferred
         his residence or the primary location of his assets abroad, the payment or allocation is deemed to have taken place on the
         day preceding that transfer, and by treating in the same way as an allocation any transfer, so that every insurer is under
         an obligation to withhold amounts in respect of income tax from capital and surrender values paid to a non-resident who has
         been, at one time or another, resident for tax purposes in that Member State, in so far as those sums have been built up,
         entirely, or partially, during the period in which the person concerned was resident in that State for tax purposes, even
         though bilateral tax agreements concluded by that State grant the right to tax such income to another Contracting State;
      
– levies tax on transfers of capital or surrender values built up by means of employers’ contributions or personal contributions
         for supplementary retirement benefits, where the transfer is made by the pension fund or insurance institution with which
         the capital or surrender values have been built up in favour of the beneficiary or persons entitled through him, to another
         pension fund or insurance institution established outside that Member State, whereas such a transfer does not constitute a
         taxable transaction if the capital or surrender values are transferred to another pension fund or insurance institution established
         within that State;
      
– requires foreign insurers who have no place of business in that Member State to obtain authorisation, before providing their
         services in that State, for a representative residing there, who must personally assume, in writing, responsibility towards
         the State for paying the annual tax on insurance contracts, interest and fines which may be due in respect of contracts relating
         to risks situated in that State
      
thereby fails to fulfil its obligations under Articles EC, EC, EC and EC, Articles 28, and of the European
         Economic Area Agreement and Article of Directive 92/on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions
         relating to direct life assurance and amending Directives 79/and 90/(third life assurance Directive) – following revision,
         Article 5(1) of Directive 2002/concerning life assurance.
      
Since the provisions of the Treaty and of the EEA Agreement on freedom of movement for workers, freedom of establishment and
         freedom of movement for persons preclude such legislation, it is not necessary to consider that legislation separately in
         the light of Article EC on free movement of capital.
      
(see paras 79-80, operative part)

THE COURT (Second Chamber),
composed of C.W.A. Timmermans, President of the Chamber, P. Kūris (Rapporteur), J. Klučka, R. Silva de Lapuerta and L. Bay
         Larsen, Judges,
      
Advocate General: C. Stix-Hackl,
Registrar: R. Grass,
having regard to the written procedure,
after hearing the Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting on October 2006,
gives the following
Judgment
By its application the Commission of the European Communities is requesting the Court to find that: 
–       by making the deductibility of employers’ supplementary pension and life assurance contributions subject to the condition,
         laid down in Article of the Code des impôts sur les revenus (‘Income Tax Code 1992’) consolidated by the Royal Decree
         of April (Moniteur belge of July 1992, p. 17120), as amended by the Law of April on supplementary pensions
         and the tax regime applying thereto and to certain additional social security advantages (Moniteur belge of May 2003, p.
         26407, and – rectification – Moniteur belge of May 2003, p. 28892; ‘the CIR 1992’), that those contributions be paid to
         an insurance undertaking or welfare fund established in Belgium;
      
–       by making the tax reduction for long-term savings, granted pursuant to Articles 145/and 145/of the CIR for personal
         supplementary pension and life assurance contributions in the form of deductions made by the employer from the employee’s
         remuneration, subject to the condition that the contributions be paid to an insurance undertaking or welfare fund established
         in Belgium;
      
–       by providing, in Article 364a of the CIR 1992, that, when capital, surrender values and savings referred to in Article of the CIR are paid or allocated to a taxpayer who has previously transferred his residence or the primary location of
         his assets abroad, the payment or allocation is deemed to have taken place on the day preceding that transfer, and by treating,
         pursuant to the second paragraph of Article 364a, in the same way as an allocation any transfer referred to in Article 34(2)(3),
         so that every insurer is under an obligation to withhold amounts in respect of income tax, in accordance with Article of the CIR 1992, from capital and surrender values paid to a non-resident who has been, at one time or another, resident for
         tax purposes in Belgium, in so far as those sums have been built up, entirely, or partially, during the period in which the
         person concerned was a Belgian resident for tax purposes, even though bilateral tax agreements concluded by the Kingdom of
         Belgium grant the right to tax such income to another Contracting State;
      
–       by levying tax, pursuant to Article 364b of the CIR 1992, on transfers of capital or surrender values built up by means of
         employers’ contributions or personal contributions for supplementary retirement benefits, where the transfer is made by the
         pension fund or insurance institution with which the capital or surrender values have been built up in favour of the beneficiary
         or persons entitled through him, to another pension fund or insurance institution established outside Belgium, while such
         a transfer does not constitute a taxable transaction if the capital or surrender values are transferred to another pension
         fund or insurance institution established in Belgium; and
      
–       by requiring, on the basis of Article 224/2a of the Règlement général sur les taxes assimilées au timbre (General Regulation
         on taxes assimilated to stamp duty) resulting from the Royal Decree of March (Moniteur belge of March 1927, p. 921),
         as amended by the Royal Decree of July (Moniteur belge of September 1994, p. 22260; ‘the general regulation’), foreign
         insurers who have no place of business in Belgium to obtain authorisation, before providing their services in Belgium, for
         a representative residing in Belgium, who must personally assume, in writing, responsibility towards the State for paying
         the annual tax on insurance contracts, interest and fines which may be due in respect of contracts relating to risks situated
         in Belgium,
      
the Kingdom of Belgium has failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles EC, EC, EC, EC and EC and Articles
         28, 31, and of the Agreement on the European Economic Area of May (OJ L 1, p. 3; ‘the EEA Agreement’), and
         Council Directive 92/96/EEC of November on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating
         to direct life assurance and amending Directives 79/267/EEC and 90/619/EEC (third life assurance Directive) (OJ L 360,
         p. 1), – following revision, Articles 5(1) and 53(2) of Directive 2002/83/EC’ of the European Parliament and of the Council
         of November concerning life assurance (OJ L 345, p. 1).
      
 Legal context
 The EEA Agreement
Articles 28, 31, and of the EEA Agreement correspond, respectively, to Article EC, EC, EC and EC. 
 Community rules
Article 1(1) of Council Directive 77/799/EEC of December concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities
         of the Member States in the field of direct taxation, certain excise duties and taxation of insurance premiums (OJ L
         336, p. 15), as amended by Council Directive 2003/93/EC of October (OJ L 264, p. 23; ‘Directive 77/799’), states:
      
‘In accordance with this Directive the competent authorities of the Member States shall exchange any information that may
         enable them to effect a correct assessment of taxes on income and capital and any information relating to the assessment of
         the following indirect taxes:
      
–       taxation of insurance premiums referred to in the sixth indent of Article of Council Directive 76/308/EEC [of March on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures (OJ L 73,
         p. 18), as amended by Council Directive 2001/44/EC of June (OJ L 175, p. 17; ‘Directive 76/308’)],
      
…’
Under Article of Directive 76/308:
‘This Directive shall apply to all claims relating to:
…
(h)      taxes on insurance premiums;
…’
Article of Directive 76/states: 
‘In this Directive: 
…
–       “taxes on insurance premiums” means:
…
in Belgium: (i) Taxe annuelle sur les contrats d’assurance [annual tax on insurance contracts]
…’
Articles et seq. of Directive 76/lay down the rules to be incorporated into the laws, regulations and administrative
         provisions of the Member States to ensure the recovery in each Member State of the claims referred to in Article of the
         Directive which arise in another Member State.
      
Article 5(1) of Directive 2002/states: 
‘Authorisation shall be valid for the entire Community. It shall permit an assurance undertaking to carry on business there,
         under either the right of establishment or freedom to provide services.’
      
Article of Directive 2002/83, entitled ‘Taxes on premiums’, provides that:
‘(1)      Without prejudice to any subsequent harmonisation, every assurance contract shall be subject exclusively to the indirect taxes
         and parafiscal charges on assurance premiums in the Member State of the commitment, …
      
…
(3)      Pending future harmonisation, each Member State shall apply to those assurance undertakings which cover commitments situated
         within its territory its own national provisions for measures to ensure the collection of indirect taxes and parafiscal charges
         due under paragraph 1.’
      
Article 53(2) of Directive 2002/states:
‘Under the conditions laid down by national law, each Member State shall authorise agencies and branches set up within its
         territory and covered by this Title to transfer all or part of their portfolios of contracts to an assurance undertaking with
         a head office in another Member State, if the competent authorities of that Member State certify that after taking the transfer
         into account the accepting office possesses the necessary solvency margin.’
      
According to point (k), entitled ‘arrangements introduced by the host Member State for charging indirect taxes on insurance
         premiums for policies concluded under the freedom to provide services: appointment of a tax representative of the insurer’,
         of subsection 3, concerning the application of the principles relating to the general good to the insurance sector, of Title
         II, entitled ‘The general good in the third insurance directives; applicability of rules promoting the general good’, of the
         Commission Interpretative Communication – Freedom to provide services and the general good in the insurance sector’ (OJ C 43, p. 5; ‘the interpretative communication’), the Member States may require the appointment of a tax representative of
         the insurer doing business under the freedom to provide services to guarantee the home Member State that its own legislation
         will be complied with and that the above taxes and charges will be charged, provided the practical arrangements whereby that
         Member State implements the measure comply with the criteria laid down by the Court of Justice of the European Communities,
         and in particular the requirements of necessity and proportionality.
      
 National law 
Article of the CIR is worded as follows: 
‘(1)      Irrespective of the person liable, the beneficiary, the classification or the detailed rules for the determining and granting

         transferred his residence or the primary location of his assets abroad, the payment or allocation is deemed to have taken
         place on the day preceding that transfer.
      
For the purposes of the first paragraph, any transfer referred to in Article 34(2)(3) shall be treated in the same way as
         an allocation.’
      
Article 364b of the CIR states:
‘When capital, or surrender values, built up by means of personal contributions referred to in Article 52(7)a or Article 145/1(1),
         employers’ contributions or company contributions are transferred, by the welfare institution or insurance undertaking with
         which they have been built up, in favour of the beneficiary or persons entitled through him, under a pension commitment or
         similar pension agreement, that transaction is not regarded as a payment or an allocation, even if the transfer is carried
         out at the beneficiary’s request, without prejudice to the right to levy tax at the time of subsequent payment or allocation
         by the institution or undertaking to the beneficiary.
      
The first paragraph does not apply to the transfer of capital or of surrender values to a welfare institution or insurance
         undertaking established abroad.’
      
The Article of the Code des taxes assimilées au timbre (Code on taxes assimilated to stamp duty) (‘the CTAT’), as in force
         on January 2004, is worded as follows: 
      
‘Insurance contracts shall be subject to an annual tax if one of the three conditions below is met:
(1)      the insurer carries on a professional insurance business, and has his principal place of business, an agency, a branch, a
         representative or some other place of business in Belgium;
      
(2)      the insured person has his domicile or habitual residence in Belgium;
(3)      the subject of the contract is movable or immovable property situated in Belgium.’ 
The first paragraph of Article 176/of the CTAT states: 
‘The tax liability is calculated on the total amount of premiums or contributions, plus charges, to be paid or borne during
         the tax year either by the insured persons or by the beneficiaries and their employers.’
      
Article of the CTAT provides that the annual tax on insurance contracts shall be paid:
‘(1)      by the insurance associations, funds, companies or undertakings, pension agencies and legal persons responsible for implementing
         the obligation of solidarity in the context of the pension schemes referred to in the Law of April on supplementary
         pensions and the tax regime applying thereto and to certain additional social security advantages, and by all other insurers
         when they have their principal place of business, an agency, a branch, a representative or some other place of business in
         Belgium;
      
(2)      by brokers and any other intermediaries resident in Belgium, for contracts concluded through them with foreign insurers who
         do not have a representative responsible as referred to in Article in Belgium;
      
(3)       by the insured person, in all other cases.’ 
Article of the CTAT provides: 
‘…
Foreign insurers which have a branch, agency or some other place of business in Belgium shall also be required, before carrying
         on any operation in Belgium, to have authorised by the Minister for Finance a representative residing in Belgium, who must
         personally assume, in writing, responsibility towards the State for paying the annual tax on insurance contracts and any fines
         which may be payable. 
      
In the case of the death of that representative, or of the withdrawal of his ministerial authorisation, or of any event leading
         to his incapacity, he shall be replaced immediately. 
      
…’
Article 224/2(a) of the general regulation states:
‘In the cases referred to in Article 177(3) of the [CTAT], the foreign insurance undertaking shall pay the tax and, where
         relevant, interest and fines, on behalf of the insured person. To that end, any foreign insurance undertaking which has no
         agency, branch or other place of business in Belgium and which wishes to offer to underwrite contracts relating to risks situated
         in Belgium must, before carrying out such operations, have authorised by the Minister for Finance a representative residing
         in Belgium who personally assumes, in writing, responsibility towards the State for paying the annual tax on insurance contracts,
         interest and fines which may be due in respect of the abovementioned contracts.’
      
 Pre‑litigation procedure 
After giving the Kingdom of Belgium formal notice to submit its observations on the compatibility of various provisions of
         Belgian legislation with Articles EC, EC, EC, EC and EC, Articles 28, 31, 36, and of the EEA Agreement and
         Articles and 11(2) of Directive 92/96, the Commission issued a reasoned opinion on December requesting that Member
         State to take the measures necessary to comply with that opinion within a period of two months of receiving it.
      
As it found the Kingdom of Belgium’s response to the reasoned opinion to be unsatisfactory, the Commission brought the present
         action.
      
 The action
 The obstacles to the freedom to provide services
 Arguments of the parties
According to the Commission, Article of the CIR 1992, in as much as it makes the deduction of employers’ contributions
         and premiums due in respect of supplementary pension and life assurance subject to the condition that they be paid to an insurance
         undertaking or welfare institution established in Belgium, and Article 145/of the CIR 1992, in as much as it makes the tax
         reduction for personal supplementary pension and life assurance contributions and premiums subject to the same condition,
         constitute a restriction on the freedom to provide services. Such legislation dissuades, first, interested persons from taking
         out supplementary retirement insurance from insurance undertakings or welfare institutions established in another Member State
         and, second, those undertakings and institutions from offering their services on the Belgian market. There is no objective
         reason enabling the Kingdom of Belgium to justify that legislation since, by reason of bilateral agreements or on the basis
         of administrative circulars, its competent authorities accept the deduction of contributions paid abroad. 
      
The Commission submits that an obstacle to the freedom to provide services is also constituted by the discriminatory rule
         in Article 364b of the CIR which provides for the taxation of capital or surrender values built up by means of employers’
         contributions or personal contributions in respect of supplementary retirement insurance which are transferred to a pension
         fund or insurance institution established abroad. Such a transfer is not taxable when made to a pension fund or insurance
         institution established in Belgium. 
      
In addition, the Commission claims that Article 224/2a of the general regulation, which requires foreign insurance undertakings
         to appoint a representative residing in Belgium, who must give a personal undertaking to pay the annual tax on insurance contracts,
         combined with the joint and several liability of the insured person, as laid down in Article 177(3) of the CTAT, is disproportionate
         to the need to guarantee payment of that tax. That result could be achieved by less restrictive means, such as information
         exchange agreements with the other Member States.
      
The Commission further points out that Directive 77/permits such assistance between Member States, which, in conjunction
         with the joint liability of insured residents, makes the appointment of a representative unnecessary. 
      
Finally, the Commission adds that the national legislation compromises the rights of insurance institutions and bodies by
         introducing tax provisions which are contrary to the rules of the EC Treaty concerning the principles of freedom of movement
         and non‑discrimination. First, those institutions and bodies which have obtained authorisation in a Member State, pursuant
         to Article of Directive 2002/83, should be able to carry on their business under either the right of establishment or the
         freedom to provide services throughout the Community. Second, the same institutions and bodies established in a Member State
         should be authorised, in accordance with Article 53(2) of that directive, to transfer all or part of their portfolios to an
         accepting office established in the Community. 
      
The Belgian Government points out that, as a result of the amendments made by the framework law of December (Moniteur
         belge of December 2005, p. 57315), the Royal Decree of February amending [the general regulation] (Moniteur belge
         of March 2006, p. 12463) and the Ministerial Decree of March implementing Article 224(3) [of that regulation] (Moniteur
         belge of March 2006, p. 16249), there is no longer an obligation to appoint a tax representative for insurance undertakings
         which are not established in Belgium but which have their principal place of business in the territory of the European Economic
         Area. 
      
 Findings of the Court
–       Admissibility
It must be pointed out, at the outset, that, by its action, the Commission requests the Court to find, inter alia, that the
         Kingdom of Belgium has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 11(2) of Directive 92/96, following revision, Article
         53(2) of Directive 2002/83. However, having regard to Annex VI of Directive 2002/83, consisting of a correlation table, it
         must be found that Article 11(2) of Directive 92/corresponds not only to Article 53(2) of Directive 2002/but also to
         Article 14(1) of that directive. In those circumstances, it must be found that the Court is not in a position to be able to
         determine, with any certainty, the legal basis on which it is to give judgment on the assessment of the validity of that complaint.
      
It is therefore necessary to declare the claim, alleging failure to comply with Article 11(2) of Directive 92/96, now – following
         revision – Article 53(2) of Directive 2002/83, inadmissible.
      
–       Substance
It should be noted that, although direct taxation falls within the competence of the Member States, they must none the less
         exercise that competence consistently with Community law (see, in particular, Case C‑150/Commission v Denmark [2007] ECR I‑0000, paragraph and the case‑law cited).
      
It should also be borne in mind that the provision of insurance constitutes a service within the meaning of Article EC
         and that Article EC precludes the application of any national legislation which, without objective justification, impedes
         a provider of services from actually exercising the freedom to provide them (see Commission v Denmark, paragraph 37, and the case‑law cited).
      
With reference to the single market and in order to permit the achievement of its objectives, Article EC precludes the
         application of any national rules which have the effect of making the provision of services between Member States more difficult
         than the provision of services purely within one Member State (see Safir, paragraph 23, Commission v Denmark, paragraph 38, and the case‑law cited). 
      
In addition, according to the Court’s case-law, Article EC precludes, inter alia, any national legislation which is liable
         to prohibit or further impede the activities of a provider of services established in another Member State where he lawfully
         provides similar services (see, to that effect, Case C‑118/Safir [1998] ECR I‑1897, paragraph 22, and Joined Cases C‑544/and C‑545/Mobistar and Belgacom Mobile [2005] ECR I‑7723, paragraph 29).
      
In the present case, it should be noted that, by making, pursuant to Article of the CIR 1992, the deductibility of employers’
         insurance contributions and premiums due in respect of supplementary pension and life assurance subject to the condition that
         they be paid to an insurance undertaking or welfare fund established in Belgium and, pursuant to Articles 145/and 145/of the CIR 1992, the tax reduction for personal supplementary pension and life assurance contributions in the form of deductions
         made by the employer from the employee’s remuneration, or in the form of deductions made by the undertaking from the remuneration
         of a director who is not under a contract of employment, subject to the condition that the contributions be paid to an insurance
         undertaking or welfare fund established in Belgium, the Belgian legislation has the effect of rendering the freedom to provide
         insurance services from other Member States more difficult than if it were purely within the Kingdom of Belgium. Those measures
         are liable to dissuade individuals from taking out insurance with foreign insurance companies. Consequently, those measures
         constitute obstacles to the freedom to provide services laid down in Article EC. 
      
That conclusion must also apply in respect of Article 364b of the CIR 1992, under which capital or surrender values which
         are transferred to a pension fund or insurance undertaking established abroad are taxed, while no such taxation is provided
         for where transfers are made to a pension fund or to an insurance undertaking established in Belgium. That measure is liable
         to further impede the activities of a provider of insurance services established in a Member State other than the Kingdom
         of Belgium where it lawfully provides such services. 
      
Finally, as regards the obligation laid down in Article 224/2a of the general regulation for an insurance undertaking established
         in another Member State to appoint a representative in Belgium, it must be found that such an obligation, as a result of the
         costs and constraints which it entails, including for undertakings in possession of authorisation within the meaning of Article
         of Directive 2002/83, is liable to dissuade those undertakings from offering their services in Belgium. Consequently, such
         legislation also constitutes an obstacle to the freedom to provide services. 
      
The Commission also claims that the Kingdom of Belgium has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article of the EEA Agreement
         relating to the freedom to provide services. 
      
As stated in Article of the EEA Agreement, in so far as they are identical in substance to the corresponding rules of the
         Treaty and to acts adopted in application of the Treaty, the provisions of the Agreement are, in their implementation and
         application, to be interpreted in conformity with the relevant rulings of the Court given prior to the date of signature of
         that Agreement.
      
Furthermore, both the Court of Justice and the Court of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) have recognised the need
         to ensure that the rules of the EEA Agreement which are identical in substance to those of the Treaty are interpreted uniformly
         (judgment of the Court of Justice in Case C‑471/Keller Holding [2006] ECR I‑2107, paragraph 48, and the case‑law cited, and Case C‑345/Commission v Portugal [2006] ECR I‑0000, paragraph 40, and of the EFTA Court in Case E‑1/EFTA Surveillance Authority v Iceland [2003] EFTA Court Report 143, paragraph 27).
      
It is to be noted that the rule prohibiting restrictions on the freedom to provide services laid down in Article of the
         EEA Agreement is identical to that established in Article EC.
      
In those circumstances, it must be concluded that the Belgian legislation at issue constitutes an obstacle to the freedom
         to provide services laid down in Article EC and Article of the EEA Agreement. 
      
It follows, however, from well-established case‑law that national measures liable to hinder or make less attractive the exercise
         of fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty may nevertheless be allowed provided they pursue a legitimate objective compatible
         with the Treaty, are justified by imperative requirements in the general interest, are suitable for securing the attainment
         of the objective which they pursue, and do not go beyond what is necessary in order to attain it (see, to that effect, Case
         C‑9/De Lasteyrie du Saillant [2004] ECR I‑2409, paragraph 49; Case C‑470/N [2006] ECR I‑7409, paragraph 40; and Commission v Denmark, paragraph 46).
      
The Belgian Government, it must be noted, puts forward justification only in respect of the legislation requiring insurance
         undertakings established in another Member State to appoint a representative residing in Belgium. Consequently, that justification
         must be reviewed by the Court. As regards, however, the other measures covered by the Commission’s complaint alleging the
         infringement of the rule relating to the freedom to provide services laid down in Articles EC and of the EEA Agreement,
         the Commission’s action must already be considered to be founded since no justification has been put forward by the Belgian
         Government as regards those measures. 
      
The Belgian Government submits that the obligation to appoint a representative residing in Belgium is necessary to meet the
         objective relating to the need to ensure payment of the annual tax on insurance contracts, interest and fines which may be
         due in respect of contracts relating to risks situated in Belgium, entered into with insurance undertakings established in
         another Member State. In addition, given that that requirement has no bearing on the authorisation of an insurance undertaking
         or on the transfer of its portfolio, it is not disproportionate to the objective pursued. 
      
According to the Commission, the general and absolute obligation laid down in Article 224/2a of the general regulation, which
         requires foreign insurance undertakings to appoint a representative residing in Belgium, combined with the joint and several
         liability of the insured person, resulting from Article 177(3) CTAT is a disproportionate measure which constitutes an obstacle
         to the freedom of insurance companies and institutions established in other Member States to provide services. The payment
         of the annual tax on insurance contracts could be ensured by less restrictive means, such as the mutual assistance by the
         competent authorities of the Member States in the field of taxation of insurance premiums laid down by Directive 77/799. 
      
In order to determine whether the obligation, laid down in Article 224/2a of the general regulation, to appoint a representative
         residing in Belgium is necessary to ensure payment of the annual tax on insurance contracts, interest and fines which may
         be due in respect of contracts concluded abroad for risks situated in Belgium, it must be determined whether that objective
         could be met by means of less restrictive measures. 
      
First, as regards the establishment of that tax, it is clear that the first indent of Article 1(1) of Directive 77/provides
         for the exchange by the authorities of the Member States of any information that may enable them to effect a correct assessment
         of taxes on insurance premiums, in particular of the annual tax on insurance contracts laid down under Belgian law. 
      
Second, as regards the payment of the annual tax on insurance contracts, it should be pointed out that, in accordance with
         Article 50(3) of Directive 2002/83, the Kingdom of Belgium may apply to those assurance undertakings which cover commitments
         situated within its territory its national provisions for measures to guarantee the collection of indirect taxes and parafiscal
         charges on insurance premiums in respect of contracts relating to risks situated in that Member State. 
      
It is apparent from Article of the CTAT that the insured person is personally liable for payment of the annual tax on
         insurance contracts where the contract concerned has been entered into with an insurer who is not established in Belgium and
         who does not have an agency, branch, representative or some other place of business or a representative responsible within
         the meaning of Article of the CTAT, and the contract has not been entered into through a broker or other intermediary
         resident in Belgium. 
      
It follows that Belgian law contains measures capable of fulfilling the objective of ensuring payment of that tax that are
         less prejudicial to the freedom to provide services than the obligation to appoint a representative responsible residing in
         Belgium. 
      
Third, as regards recovery of the annual tax on insurance contracts, Directive 76/specifies that taxation of insurance
         premiums, including, as provided in the sixth indent of Article of that directive, that annual tax, can be the subject of
         mutual assistance for its recovery.
      
It follows from the foregoing that, the Kingdom of Belgium has the means necessary to recover the annual tax on insurance
         contracts. It follows that the obligation, for insurance undertakings which are not established in that Member State, to appoint
         a representative responsible residing in Belgium goes beyond what is necessary to ensure payment of that tax and is therefore
         disproportionate to that objective. 
      
Consequently, the arguments presented by the Belgian Government to justify the obligation laid down in Article 224a of the
         general regulation to appoint a representative responsible in Belgium cannot be upheld. It must therefore be concluded that,
         as regards that obligation, the Commission’s complaint alleging infringement of the rule relating to the freedom to provide
         services laid down in Articles EC and of the EEA Agreement must be considered to be founded. 
      
Therefore, there must be a finding of infringement regarding the latter two provisions. 
In the light of the above, it must be found that, in maintaining in force the legislation in dispute the Kingdom of Belgium
         has failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles EC and of the EEA Agreement and Article of Directive 92/96, following
         revision, Article 5(1) of Directive 2002/83. 
      
 The obstacle to the freedom of movement for persons
 Arguments of the parties
According to the Commission, Article of the CIR 1992, in so far as it makes the deduction of employers’ insurance contributions
         and premiums due in respect of supplementary pension and life assurance subject to the condition that they be paid to an insurance
         undertaking or welfare institution established in Belgium, and Articles 145/and 145/of the CIR 1992, in so far as they
         make the reduction of tax for personal contributions and premiums for supplementary pension and life assurance subject to
         the same condition, run counter to freedom of movement for employed and self‑employed persons. When such workers who have
         worked in a Member State other that the Kingdom of Belgium where they joined an occupational pension scheme come to work in
         that latter Member State, the contributions paid into the scheme cannot be deducted or give rise to a tax reduction. However,
         the income resulting from those schemes is taxable in Belgium when those workers are resident there. 
      
Similarly, the Commission considers that the taxation of capital or surrender values when they are transferred to a pension
         fund or insurance institution established abroad resulting from Article 364b of the CIR constitutes an unjustified impairment
         of freedom of movement and freedom of establishment for employed and self‑employed persons residing in Belgium who wish to
         go to another Member State in order to carry on an economic activity there and who, at that juncture, want to transfer that
         capital or surrender values. The emigration of a Belgian resident to another Member State does not constitute an ‘abuse’ but
         the exercise of a fundamental right recognised in Articles EC, EC and EC and Articles and of the EEA Agreement.
         
      
Finally, the Commission submits that Article 364a of the CIR 1992, which creates the fiction that the payment or allocation
         of capital, surrender values and savings takes place on the day preceding the transfer of the taxpayer’s residence or of the
         primary location of his assets abroad, constitutes an unjustified impairment of freedom of movement and freedom of establishment
         of employed and self‑employed persons and of the general right of freedom of movement for persons under Article EC. 
      
In its letter of May in response to a question posed by the Court, the Belgian Government stated that, following a
         judgment of the Belgian Cour de Cassation (Court of Cassation) of December 2003, the Belgian authorities now apply the provisions
         of Article 364a of the CIR only where no agreement for the avoidance of double taxation has been concluded or where such
         an agreement gives the Kingdom of Belgium the right to tax income. In addition, capital is taxed only from the time that it
         is actually paid or allocated and at identical rates to those which apply to Belgian residents. 
      
 Findings of the Court
It should be pointed out, at the outset, that, according to the Court’s settled case‑law, the provisions of the Treaty relating
         to freedom of movement for workers and those on freedom of establishment preclude, inter alia, the Member State of origin
         from obstructing the freedom of one of its nationals to accept and pursue employment in another Member State or the establishment
         in another Member State of one of its nationals or of a company incorporated under its legislation (see, to that effect, inter
         alia, Portugal v Commission, paragraphs and 18, and the case‑law cited).
      
In the present case, as regards, first, the refusal, (i) to grant a right to deduct employers’ insurance contributions and
         premiums due in respect of supplementary pension and life assurance where they are paid to an insurance undertaking or a welfare
         institution which is not established in Belgium, which results from Article of the CIR 1992, and (ii) to grant, pursuant
         to Articles 145/and 145/of the CIR 1992, the tax reduction on personal supplementary pension and life assurance contributions
         and premiums paid to bodies established in other Member States, the national legislation has the effect of granting a tax
         advantage which varies depending on the place in which those contributions and premiums are collected and is accordingly likely
         to dissuade employed and self‑employed persons from exercising their right to move freely in another Member State. 
      
It follows that Articles 59, 145/and 145/of the CIR impair the free movement of employed persons and the freedom
         of establishment of self‑employed persons as guaranteed by Articles EC and EC. 
      
Second, as pointed out by the Advocate General in paragraph of her Opinion, the fiction created by Article 364a of the
         CIR seeks to allow taxation by reason of the crossing of a border by employed or self-employed persons. 
      
In that regard, the declaration of the Belgian authorities that, where there is a tax agreement for the avoidance of double
         taxation which attributes the right to tax income to another contracting State, Article 364a of the CIR is no longer
         applied, even where that State does not make use of that right, does not constitute proper compliance with the obligations
         imposed on the Kingdom of Belgium under Community law. 
      
Even if, in practice, the authorities of a Member State do not apply a national provision which is at variance with Community
         law, the principle of legal certainty nevertheless requires that that provision be amended (see, to that effect, Case C‑358/Commission v Italy [2000] ECR I‑1255, paragraphs and 17, and Case C‑160/Commission v France [2000] ECR I‑6137, paragraph 22). 
      
It is thus necessary to consider that Article 364a of the CIR also impairs the freedom of movement of employed persons
         and the freedom of establishment of self‑employed persons guaranteed by Articles EC and EC. 
      
Finally, as regards the complaint alleging infringement, by Article 364a, of the general right of freedom of movement for
         persons guaranteed by Article EC with regard to persons who are not economically active, the same conclusion applies, for
         the same reasons (see, to that effect, Case C‑406/De Cuyper [2006] ECR I‑6947, paragraphs and 40). 
      
Third, by levying tax on transfers of capital or surrender values where the transfer is made by the pension fund or insurance
         institution with which the capital or surrender values have been built up in favour of the beneficiary or persons entitled
         through him, to another insurance institution established outside Belgium, Article 364b of the CIR dissuades employed
         and self‑employed persons from establishing themselves in another Member State by preventing them from forwarding their savings.
      
It must therefore be found that Article 364b of the CIR impairs the freedom of movement of employed persons and the freedom
         of establishment of self-employed persons guaranteed by Articles EC and EC.
      
The Commission also claims that, as a result of the existence of those provisions of domestic law, the Kingdom of Belgium
         has failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles and of the EEA Agreement, relating to freedom of movement for workers
         and freedom of establishment.
      
It is to be noted, in that regard, that the rules prohibiting restrictions on freedom of movement and freedom of establishment
         laid down in Articles and of the EEA Agreement are identical to those established in Articles EC and EC.
      
In those circumstances, the Commission’s action must also be considered to be founded as regards the complaint alleging infringement
         of the rules on freedom of movement for persons and freedom of establishment laid down in the EEA Agreement. 
      
It must therefore be held that, by maintaining in force legislation which denies, under Article of the CIR 1992, a right
         to deduct employer’s contributions or to grant, under Article 145/and 145/of the CIR 1992, a tax reduction on personal
         contributions paid to insurance bodies established in other Member States or which creates, under Article 364a of the CIR
         1992, a legal fiction, or which taxes, under Article 364b of the CIR 1992, capital or surrender values which are transferred
         to a pension fund or insurance undertaking established outside Belgium, the Kingdom of Belgium has failed to fulfil its obligations
         under Articles EC, EC and EC and Articles and of the EEA Agreement. 
      
Since the provisions of the Treaty and of the EEA Agreement on freedom of movement for workers, freedom of establishment and
         freedom movement for persons preclude the national provisions referred to in the preceding paragraph, it is not necessary
         to consider that legislation separately in the light of Article EC on free movement of capital (see, to that effect, Commission v Portugal, paragraph 45, and Commission v Denmark, paragraph 76).
      
Consequently, it must be held that: 
–       by making the deductibility of employers’ insurance contributions due in respect of supplementary pension and life assurance
         subject to the condition, laid down in Article of the CIR 1992, that such contributions be paid to an insurance undertaking
         or welfare fund established in Belgium;
      
–       by making the tax reduction for long-term savings, granted by virtue of Articles 145/and 145/of the CIR for personal
         supplementary pension and life assurance contributions paid in the form of deductions made by the employer from the employee’s
         remuneration, or in the form of deductions made by the undertaking from the remuneration of a director who is not under a
         contract of employment, subject to the condition that those contributions be paid to an insurance undertaking or welfare fund
         established in Belgium;
      
–       by providing, in Article 364a of the CIR 1992, that, when capital, surrender values and savings referred to in Article of the CIR are paid or allocated to a taxpayer who has previously transferred his residence or the primary location of
         his assets abroad, the payment or allocation is deemed to have taken place on the day preceding that transfer, and by treating,
         pursuant to the second paragraph of Article 364a, in the same way as an allocation any transfer referred to in Article 34(2)(3),
         so that every insurer is under an obligation to withhold amounts in respect of income tax, in accordance with Article of the CIR 1992, from capital and surrender values paid to a non-resident who has been, at one time or another, resident for
         tax purposes in Belgium, in so far as those sums have been built up, entirely, or partially, during the period in which the
         person concerned was a Belgian resident for tax purposes, even though bilateral tax agreements concluded by the Kingdom of
         Belgium grant the right to tax such income to another Contracting State;
      
–       by levying tax, pursuant to Article 364b of the CIR 1992, on transfers of capital or surrender values built up by means of
         employers’ contributions or personal contributions for supplementary retirement benefits, where the transfer is made by the
         pension fund or insurance institution with which the capital or surrender values have been built up in favour of the beneficiary
         or persons entitled through him, to another pension fund or insurance institution established outside Belgium, while such
         a transfer does not constitute a taxable transaction if the capital or surrender values are transferred to another pension
         fund or insurance institution established in Belgium; and
      
–       by requiring, on the basis of Article 224/2a of the general regulation, foreign insurers who have no place of business in
         Belgium to obtain authorisation, before providing their services in Belgium, for a representative residing in Belgium, who
         must personally assume, in writing, responsibility towards the State for paying the annual tax on insurance contracts, interest
         and fines which may be due in respect of contracts relating to risks situated in Belgium,
      
the Kingdom of Belgium has failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles EC, EC, EC and EC, Articles 28, and of the EEA Agreement and, Article of Directive 92/96, following revision, Article 5(1) of Directive 2002/83. 
      
 Costs
Under Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been
         applied for in the successful party’s pleadings. Since the Commission has applied for costs and the Kingdom of Belgium has
         been unsuccessful in its submissions, the latter must be ordered to pay the costs.
      
On those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules:
1.     By making the deductibility of employers’ insurance contributions supplementary pension and life assurance subject to the
            condition, laid down in Article of the Income Tax Code consolidated by the Royal Decree of April 1992, as amended
            by the Law of April on supplementary pensions and the tax regime applying thereto and to certain additional social
            security advantages, that those contributions be paid to an insurance undertaking or welfare fund established in Belgium;
–       by making the tax reduction for long-term savings, granted by virtue of Articles 145/and 145/of the Income Tax Code 1992,
            as amended by the Law of April 2003, for personal supplementary pension and life assurance contributions and premiums paid
            in the form of deductions made by the employer from the employee’s remuneration, or in the form of deductions made by the
            undertaking from the remuneration of a director who is not under a contract of employment, subject to the condition that those
            contributions and premiums be paid to an insurance undertaking or welfare fund established in Belgium;
–       by providing, in Article 364a of the Income Tax Code 1992,  as amended by the Law of April 2003, that, when capital, surrender
            values and savings referred to in Article of the Income Tax Code are paid or allocated to a taxpayer who has previously
            transferred his residence or the primary location of his assets abroad, the payment or allocation is deemed to have taken
            place on the day preceding that transfer, and by treating, pursuant to the second paragraph of Article 364a, in the same way
            as an allocation any transfer referred to in Article 34(2)(3), so that every insurer is under an obligation to withhold amounts
            in respect of income tax, in accordance with Article of the Code, from capital and surrender values paid to a non-resident
            who has been, at one time or another, resident for tax purposes in Belgium, in so far as those sums have been built up, entirely,
            or partially, during the period in which the person concerned was a Belgian resident for tax purposes, even though bilateral
            tax agreements concluded by the Kingdom of Belgium grant the right to tax such income to another Contracting State;
–       by providing in Article 364a of the Income Tax Code 1992, as amended by the Law of April 2003, that, where the capital,
            surrender values and savings referred to in Article of that code are paid or allocated to a taxpayer who has previously
            transferred his residence or the primary location of his assets abroad, the payment or allocation is deemed to have taken
            place on the day preceding that transfer, and by, under paragraph of the same article, assimilating to an allocation all
            transfers referred to in Article 34(2)(3), so that every insurer is under an obligation to withhold amounts in respect of
            income tax, in accordance with Article of the Code, as amended, from capital and redemption values paid to a non-resident
            who has been, at one time or another, a resident for tax purposes in Belgium, provided that those sums have, totally or partially,
            been constituted during the period in which the person concerned was a Belgian resident for tax purposes, even though bilateral
            tax agreements concluded by the Kingdom of Belgium grant the right to tax such income to another Contracting State;
–       by levying tax, pursuant to Article 364b of the Income Tax Code 1992, as amended by the Law of April 2003, on transfers
            of capital or surrender values built up by means of employers’ contributions or personal contributions for supplementary retirement
            benefits, where the transfer is made by the pension fund or insurance institution with which the capital or surrender values
            have been built up in favour of the beneficiary or persons entitled through him, to another pension fund or insurance institution
            established outside Belgium, while such a transfer does not constitute a taxable transaction if the capital or surrender values
            are transferred to another pension fund or insurance institution established in Belgium;
the Kingdom of Belgium has failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles EC, EC, EC and EC, Articles 28, and of the Agreement establishing the European Economic Area of May and Article of Directive 92/96/EEC, following
            revision, Article 5(1) of Directive 2002/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of November concerning
            life assurance.
2.     The remainder of the action is dismissed. 
3.     The Kingdom of Belgium is ordered to pay the costs.
