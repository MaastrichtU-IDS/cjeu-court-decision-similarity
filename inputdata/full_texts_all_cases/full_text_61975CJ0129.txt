Subject of the case
APPLICATION PRINCIPALLY FOR A RULING REGARDING THE LEGALITY OF THE REFUSAL BY A SUPERIOR OFFICER TO ALLOW THE APPLICANT TO CARRY OUT A MISSION WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A COMPETITION PROCEDURE AND THE CLAIMS RELATING THERETO IN THE ACTION FOR ANNULMENT AND COMPENSATION , 
Grounds
IN SUBSTANCE THE APPLICATION IS FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF A MEMORANDUM ADDRESSED TO THE APPLICANT , AN ADMINISTRATOR IN DIRECTORATE GENERAL VI , DIRECTORATE G , DIVISION , BY HER IMMEDIATE SUPERIOR , AS A RESULT OF A MISSION CARRIED OUT BY THE OFFICIAL CONCERNED AWAY FROM HER PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT WITHOUT A TRAVEL ORDER FOR THAT PURPOSE .   THE APPLICANT HAD BEEN APPOINTED BY THE CENTRAL STAFF COMMITTEE TO TAKE PART , AS AN ALTERNATE MEMBER OF THE SELECTION BOARD , IN A RECRUITMENT COMPETITION ORGANIZED IN LUXEMBOURG , AT A TIME WHEN SHE WAS ON SICK LEAVE ALTHOUGH CONTINUING HER WORK AT HOME .   IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES , THE HEAD OF DIVISION , THE DIRECT SUPERIOR OF THE APPLICANT , REFUSED TO ISSUE A TRAVEL ORDER AND , BY A TELEGRAM OF APRIL , EXPRESSLY ASKED THE OFFICIAL CONCERNED TO ABANDON THE PROJECTED TRIP ; THE APPLICANT HOWEVER WENT TO LUXEMBOURG ON APRIL , AFTER CONSULTING THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SELECTION BOARD .   BY A LETTER OF APRIL THE HEAD OF DIVISION ASKED FOR EXPLANATIONS . THEN ON APRIL HE ADDRESSED A MEMORANDUM DESCRIBED AS A ' WARNING '  TO THE APPLICANT , IN WHICH HE CRITICIZES BOTH THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE APPLICATION FOR A TRAVEL ORDER HAD BEEN SUBMITTED TO HIM AND THE FACT THAT THE MISSION HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT DESPITE HIS FORMAL OPPOSITION AND DURING A PERIOD WHEN , AS FAR AS HER ORDINARY DUTIES WERE CONCERNED , THE APPLICANT WAS ON SICK LEAVE .   FOLLOWING THIS NOTE , THE APPLICANT ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARIAT GENERAL OF THE COMMISSION A ' COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS ' , WHICH WAS LODGED ON JUNE .    THE COMMISSION TOOK NO ACTION WITH REGARD TO THAT COMPLAINT EXCEPT FOR A LETTER DATED OCTOBER IN WHICH THE DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR PERSONNEL DESCRIBED THE INCIDENT AS THE PRODUCT OF A ' MISUNDERSTANDING '  AND ASSURED THE APPLICANT THAT IT WOULD HAVE NO UNFAVOURABLE CONSEQUENCES FOR HER CAREER , CONCLUDING THAT IN HIS OPINION THE COMPLAINT ADDRESSED TO THE COMMISSION NO LONGER SERVED ANY PURPOSE IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES .   AFTER THE APPLICATION HAD BEEN LODGED ON DECEMBER , THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COMMISSION TRIED ONCE MORE , THROUGH THE HEAD OF DIRECTORATE G OF DIRECTORATE GENERAL VI , TO SETTLE AMICABLY THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH HAD ARISEN BETWEEN THE APPLICANT AND HER SUPERIOR .   ON THAT OCCASION THE APPLICANT WAS INFORMED THAT THE LATTER WAS WILLING TO RECOGNIZE ' THAT AT THE TIME SHE HAD BEEN IN A DIFFICULT POSITION AND THAT SHE WAS FACED WITH A CONFLICT OF DUTY '  AND THAT HE WAS PREPARED TO CONSIDER THE INCIDENT AS CLOSED .   THE APPLICANT HOWEVER REFUSED TO ACCEPT THIS PROPOSAL AND CONTINUED WITH HER ACTION AT LAW .   THE CONCLUSIONS IN HER APPLICATION ARE FOR THE ANNULMENT BY THE COURT OF THE MEMORANDUM OF APRIL , THE ANNULMENT OF THE REFUSAL OF THE COMMISSION TO ADMIT THE COMPLAINT OF JUNE AND FOR A SERIES OF DECLARATIONS AND ORDERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ESTABLISHING THAT THE TRAVEL ORDER SOUGHT WAS WRONGFULLY REFUSED , ACKNOWLEDGING THE APPLICANT ' S ' DEVOTION TO DUTY ' , DECLARING ' THE BASELESSNESS OF THE ACCUSATIONS '  MADE AGAINST HER AND BRINGING THESE DECLARATIONS TO THE NOTICE OF ALL PERSONS CONCERNED IN THIS MATTER .   FURTHER , THE APPLICANT SEEKS THE AWARD OF THE SYMBOLIC SUM OF FB BY WAY OF COMPENSATION FOR THE INJURY SUFFERED WITH REGARD TO HER OFFICIAL REPUTATION , HAVING REGARD TO THE ' INSINUATIONS AND ANNOYANCES '  TO WHICH SHE IS STILL BEING SUBJECTED AT THE PRESENT TIME IN HER DAILY WORK .  ADMISSIBILITY   AS THE COMMISSION HAS CHALLENGED THE ADMISSIBILITY OF CERTAIN HEADS OF THE APPLICATION , THE COURT REQUESTED THE APPLICANT TO SPECIFY THE WAY IN WHICH , IN HER OPINION , THE CONCLUSIONS IN HER APPLICATION COME WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT AS DEFINED BY ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   IT FOLLOWS FROM THE REPLIES GIVEN BY THE APPLICANT THAT THE BASIC SUBJECT-MATTER OF THE APPLICATION , HAVING REGARD TO THE REQUIREMENTS LAID DOWN BY ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , CONSISTS IN THE FAILURE OF THE COMMISSION TO ACT UPON THE COMPLAINT SUBMITTED ON JUNE .    THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION MUST BE CONSIDERED FIRST WITH REGARD TO THAT OMISSION .   IN HER COMPLAINT , AFTER REFERRING TO THE VARIOUS COMMUNICATIONS SPECIFIED ABOVE , THE APPLICANT ASKS THE COMMISSION TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE BLAMELESSNESS OF HER CONDUCT , TO WITHDRAW THE ACCUSATIONS IN THE COMMUNICATIONS OF HER SUPERIOR AND IN FUTURE TO ' PROTECT ( HER ) . . . FROM ACTS WHICH UNJUSTLY DAMAGE ( HER ) PERSONAL DIGNITY AND ( HER ) POSITION AS AN OFFICIAL ' .   IT IS NECESSARY TO EXAMINE WHETHER THE COMMISSION WAS UNDER ANY DUTY TO TAKE A DECISION OF THIS NATURE CONCERNING THE APPLICANT AND WHETHER , IN CONSEQUENCE , ITS FAILURE TO REPLY TO THE COMPLAINT OF JUNE CAN BE THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF AN APPLICATION UNDER THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   THE PURPOSE OF THE APPEALS PROVIDED FOR UNDER ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS IS TO ARRANGE FOR THE REVIEW BY THE COURT OF ACTS AND OMISSIONS BY THE ' APPOINTING AUTHORITY '  LIABLE TO AFFECT THE POSITION UNDER THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS AND SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITY .   THE GRIEVANCES EXPRESSED IN THE COMPLAINT AND IN THIS APPLICATION DO NOT CONCERN THE POSITION OF THE APPLICANT UNDER THE STAFF REGULATIONS , BUT EXCLUSIVELY INTERNAL RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE SERVICE AND , MORE PARTICULARLY , QUESTIONS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND WORKING ORGANIZATION IN THE OFFICES OF THE COMMISSION .   THEREFORE THE SUCCESSIVE ATTITUDES ADOPTED BY THE APPLICANT ' S SUPERIOR REGARDING THE TRAVEL ORDER IN QUESTION WERE NOT IN THE NATURE OF ACTS SUBJECT TO ANNULMENT WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   WHEN A COMPLAINT CONCERNING THIS MATTER WAS SUBMITTED TO THE COMMISSION IT WAS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO GRANT THE APPLICANT ' S REQUESTS , SINCE HER POSITION UNDER THE STAFF REGULATIONS WAS IN NO WAY AFFECTED BY THE INCIDENT WHICH GAVE RISE TO THE COMPLAINT .   ACCORDINGLY THIS HEAD OF THE APPLICATION MUST BE DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE .   THAT INADMISSIBILITY ENTAILS THE INADMISSIBILITY OF ALL THE OTHER REQUESTS MADE IN THE APPLICATION , INCLUDING THE CLAIM FOR COMPENSATION , SINCE , WITHOUT EXCEPTION THEY CONCERN THE SAME SUBJECT-MATTER AS THE PRINCIPAL APPLICATION .
