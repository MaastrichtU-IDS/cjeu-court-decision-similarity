Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY BY NOT ADOPTING WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIODS THE PROVISIONS NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 77/62/EEC COORDINATING PROCEDURES FOR THE AWARD OF PUBLIC SUPPLY CONTRACTS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JUNE THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 77/62/EEC OF DECEMBER COORDINATING PROCEDURES FOR THE AWARD OF PUBLIC SUPPLY CONTRACTS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY .   COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 77/62/EEC CONTAINS A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE PROHIBITION OF RESTRICTIONS ON THE FREE MOVEMENT OF GOODS LAID DOWN BY ARTICLES TO OF THE EEC TREATY IS OBSERVED IN THE FIELD OF PUBLIC SUPPLY CONTRACTS . THE OBJECT OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE DIRECTIVE IS TO COORDINATE NATIONAL PROCEDURES CONCERNING PUBLIC SUPPLY CONTRACTS , IN PARTICULAR BY INTRODUCING EQUAL CONDITIONS OF COMPETITION FOR SUCH CONTRACTS IN ALL THE MEMBER STATES , AND TO ENSURE A DEGREE OF TRANSPARENCY ALLOWING THE OBSERVANCE OF THE PROHIBITION CONTAINED IN ARTICLES TO MENTIONED ABOVE TO BE BETTER SUPERVISED .   UNDER ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE MEMBER STATES WERE OBLIGED TO ADOPT THE MEASURES NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH IT WITHIN MONTHS OF ITS NOTIFICATION AND TO INFORM THE COMMISSION THEREOF FORTHWITH . UNDER ARTICLE THEY WERE , AND STILL ARE , FURTHER OBLIGED TO COMMUNICATE TO THE COMMISSION THE TEXTS OF THE BASIC PROVISIONS OF DOMESTIC LAW , WHETHER LAWS , REGULATIONS OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS , WHICH THEY ADOPT IN THE FIELD IN QUESTION .   THE PERIOD LAID DOWN BY ARTICLE EXPIRED ON JUNE WITHOUT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC ' S HAVING ADOPTED THE NECESSARY MEASURES AND THE COMMISSION GAVE IT A FIRST REMINDER OF ITS OBLIGATION BY A LETTER OF OCTOBER . IT TOOK UP THE MATTER AGAIN AT THE MEETING ON AND NOVEMBER OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC CONTRACTS .       SEEING THAT ITS REMINDERS HAD NOT LED TO THE ADOPTION OF THE NECESSARY MEASURES , ON MARCH THE COMMISSION INVITED THE GOVERNMENT OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURE LAID DOWN BY ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY TO SUBMIT ITS OBSERVATIONS WITHIN A PERIOD OF DAYS . THE GOVERNMENT DID SO BY A TELEX MESSAGE OF APRIL . IN THAT MESSAGE IT WAS EXPLAINED THAT THE DRAFT LAW TO INCORPORATE THE DIRECTIVE INTO THE ITALIAN LEGAL SYSTEM HAD BEEN PASSED ONCE BY THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES ON SEPTEMBER AND THEN BY THE SENATE ON DECEMBER , BUT THAT CERTAIN AMENDMENTS HAD MADE IT NECESSARY FOR THE DRAFT TO BE REMITTED TO THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES . OWING TO THE DISSOLUTION OF THE LEGISLATURE PARLIAMENT COULD NOT COMPLETE ITS SCRUTINY OF THE DRAFT LAW . THE SITUATION REMAINED UNCHANGED THROUGHOUT AND ON DECEMBER OF THAT YEAR THE COMMISSION ISSUED A REASONED OPINION DECLARING THAT THERE HAD BEEN A FAILURE ON THE PART OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY AND INVITING IT TO COMPLY WITH THAT OPINION WITHIN A PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS .   THAT INVITATION WAS NOT ACTED UPON AND ON JUNE THE COMMISSION LODGED AN APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION ESTABLISHING THE NON-COMPLIANCE . THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC POINTED OUT IN ITS DEFENCE THAT THE DELAY WAS DUE TO THE DISSOLUTION OF THE LEGISLATURE , CAUSING ALL DRAFT LAWS UNDER DISCUSSION TO LAPSE AND THEREBY RENDERING NECESSARY A NEW DRAFT , WHICH HAD BEEN PRESENTED TO THE SENATE ON DECEMBER ; BUT IT DID NOT CLAIM THAT THE APPLICATION SHOULD BE DISMISSED .   THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED CANNOT EXPUNGE THE NON-COMPLIANCE COMPLAINED OF . ACCORDING TO WELL-ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW A MEMBER STATE MAY NOT PLEAD PROVISIONS , PRACTICES OR CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING IN ITS INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES .   IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO DECLARE THAT BY NOT ADOPTING WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 77/62/EEC OF DECEMBER THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ONE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY .
