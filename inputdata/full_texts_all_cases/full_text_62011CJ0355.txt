         Council Regulation (EC) No 806/of April 2003, must be interpreted as meaning that the requirement, referred to in
         Article of that directive, according to which the conditions relating to the rearing of calves must comply with the general
         provisions set out in the annex to that directive, including point of that annex, which prohibits, subject to exceptions,
         the tethering of calves, applied to calves kept confined by a farmer in the context of a dairy farming operation for agricultural
         purposes.
