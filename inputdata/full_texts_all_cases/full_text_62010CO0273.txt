Re:
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Tribunal Superior de Justicia de la Comunidad Valenciana – Interpretation of clause 4(4)
                  of the Annex to Council Directive 1999/70/EC of June concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work concluded
                  by ETUC, UNICE and CEEP (OJ L 175, p. 43) – Contracts of employment as a university lecturer and researcher concluded
                  with State universities – Exclusion of certain benefits from fixed-term contracts.
               
Operative part:
Clause 4(1) of the Framework agreement on fixed-term work, concluded on March 1999, which is annexed to Council Directive
         1999/70/EC of June concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work concluded by ETUC, UNICE and CEEP, must be
         interpreted as precluding national legislation which, without any objective justification, restricts the right to receive
         a seniority bonus to university lecturers on permanent contracts, excluding lecturers on fixed-term contracts when, as regards
         receipt of that bonus, those two categories of workers are in comparable situations.
