IN CASE 21/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE VERWALTUNGSGERICHT KOELN FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN :  FIRMA I . SCHROEDER KG, HAMBURG,  AND  OBERSTADTDIREKTOR ( CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER ) OF THE CITY OF COLOGNE, AND THE CITY OF COLOGNE,  
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 121/67/EEC OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ( OJ ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION 1967, P . ) AND OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 805/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ( OJ ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION 1968, P . ), 
Grounds
BY ORDER OF NOVEMBER WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON FEBRUARY 1975, THE VERWALTUNGSGERICHT KOELN REFERRED TO THE COURT A QUESTION ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 121/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN PIGMEAT ( OJ ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION 1967, P . ) AND OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 805/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN BEEF AND VEAL ( OJ ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ) P . ).  THIS QUESTION ASKS WHETHER THE PROHIBITION ON 'ANY CUSTOMS DUTY OR CHARGE HAVING EQUIVALENT EFFECT' WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 121/AND THE PROHIBITION OF 'ANY CHARGE HAVING EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO A CUSTOMS DUTY' WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 805/ALSO INCLUDES FEES CHARGED FOR PUBLIC AND VETERINARY HEALTH INSPECTION OF IMPORTED MEAT UNDER PARAGRAPH OF THE LAW ON THE INSPECTION OF MEAT OF OCTOBER ( RGB. I, P . ) IN THE VERSION OF JUNE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE REGULATION ON CHARGES FOR PUBLIC AND VETERINARY HEALTH INSPECTION OF IMPORTED MEAT OF FEBRUARY ( BGB. I, P . ).  THE NATIONAL COURT IS OF THE OPINION THAT 'UNDER ARTICLES AND OF THE EEC TREATY IT IS ONLY PROHIBITED FOR MEMBER STATES OF THE COMMUNITY TO LEVY BETWEEN ONE ANOTHER CUSTOMS DUTIES ON IMPORTS AND EXPORTS AND ALL CHARGES HAVING EQUIVALENT EFFECT '.  THIS QUESTION WAS RAISED IN THE CONTEXT OF AN ACTION AGAINST THE CITY OF COLOGNE BROUGHT BY THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION BEFORE THE ADMINISTRATIVE COURT TO RECOVER CHARGES PAID FOR PUBLIC AND VETERINARY HEALTH INSPECTIONS MADE UNDER THE PROVISIONS APPLICABLE WHEN CONSIGNMENTS OF PRESERVED MEAT FROM HUNGARY WERE IMPORTED .  IN THE PRESENT STATE OF THE LAW THERE IS NOTHING WHICH COULD JUSTIFY DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF THE EXPRESSION 'CHARGE HAVING EQUIVALENT EFFECT' AS IT APPEARS IN ARTICLE ET SEQ . OF THE TREATY ON THE ONE HAND AND IN ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 121/AND ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 805/ON THE OTHER .  THE CONCEPT OF 'CHARGES HAVING AN EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO A CUSTOMS DUTY' ON IMPORTS INTO THE COMMUNITY INCLUDES ANY CHARGE, LEVIED ON THE OCCASION OR BY REASON OF IMPORTATION, WHICH IS SPECIFICALLY IMPOSED ON AN IMPORTED PRODUCT TO THE EXCLUSION OF A SIMILAR COMMUNITY PRODUCT AND WHICH HAS THE SAME RESTRICTIVE EFFECT ON THE FREE MOVEMENT OF GOODS AS A CUSTOMS DUTY .  CONSEQUENTLY, PECUNIARY CHARGES OF WHATEVER AMOUNT LEVIED FOR PUBLIC AND VETERINARY HEALTH INSPECTION OF PRODUCTS IMPORTED FROM THIRD COUNTRIES WHICH ARE DETERMINED ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN PARTICULAR CRITERIA AND WHICH ARE NOT COMPARABLE TO THOSE USED TO FIX ANY PECUNIARY CHARGES WHICH MIGHT BE LEVIED ON SIMILAR COMMUNITY PRODUCTS MUST BE CONSIDERED AS CHARGES HAVING AN EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO CUSTOMS DUTIES .  
Decision on costs
THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES WHICH HAS SUBMITTED ITS OBSERVATIONS TO THE COURT ARE NOT RECOVERABLE AND AS THE PROCEEDINGS ARE, SO FAR AS THE PARTIES TO THE MAIN ACTION ARE CONCERNED, A STEP IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THE NATIONAL COURT, THE DECISION ON COSTS IS A MATTER FOR THAT COURT . 
Operative part
THE COURT  IN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION REFERRED TO IT BY THE VERWALTUNGSGERICHT KOELN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ORDER MADE BY THAT COURT ON NOVEMBER HEREBY RULES :  PECUNIARY CHARGES OF WHATEVER AMOUNT LEVIED FOR PUBLIC AND VETERINARY HEALTH INSPECTION OF PRODUCTS IMPORTED FROM THIRD COUNTRIES WHICH ARE DETERMINED ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN PARTICULAR CRITERIA AND WHICH ARE NOT COMPARABLE TO THOSE USED TO FIX ANY PECUNIARY CHARGES WHICH MIGHT BE LEVIED ON COMMUNITY PRODUCTS MUST BE CONSIDERED AS CHARGES HAVING AN EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO CUSTOMS DUTIES .
