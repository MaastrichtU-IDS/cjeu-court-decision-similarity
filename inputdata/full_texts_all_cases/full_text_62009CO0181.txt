Order of the Court (Fifth Chamber) of September – Canon Kabushiki Kaisha v IPN Bulgaria
(Case C‑181/09)
Preliminary rulings – Inadmissibility
Preliminary rulings – Admissibility – Need to provide the Court with sufficient information on the factual and legislative context (Art. EC; Statute of the
         Court of Justice, Art. 20) (see paras 8-11)
      
Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Sofiyski gradski sad (Bulgaria) – Interpretation of Article 5(3)(b) and (c), First Council
                  Directive 89/104/EEC of December to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks (OJ L 40,
                  p. 1) – Concepts of import and export of goods bearing a trade mark – Original goods or counterfeit goods?
               
Operative part: 
The reference for a preliminary ruling from the Sofiyski gradski sad made by decision April is manifestly inadmissible.
