Summary
. IN THE ABSENCE OF COMMUNITY RULES CONCERNING THE REFUNDING OF NATIONAL CHARGES WHICH HAVE BEEN LEVIED IN BREACH OF COMMUNITY LAW, IT IS FOR THE MEMBER STATES TO ENSURE THE REPAYMENT OF SUCH CHARGES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THEIR INTERNAL LAW . FURTHERMORE, COMMUNITY LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE AN ORDER FOR THE RECOVERY OF CHARGES IMPROPERLY MADE TO BE GRANTED IN CONDITIONS WHICH WOULD INVOLVE AN UNJUST ENRICHMENT OF THOSE ENTITLED . THUS IT DOES NOT PREVENT THE FACT THAT THE BURDEN OF SUCH CHARGES MAY HAVE BEEN PASSED ON TO THE TRADERS OR TO CONSUMERS FROM BEING TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION .  HOWEVER, ANY REQUIREMENT OF PROOF WHICH HAS THE EFFECT OF MAKING IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE OR EXCESSIVELY DIFFICULT TO SECURE THE REPAYMENT OF CHARGES LEVIED CONTRARY TO COMMUNITY LAW IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH COMMUNITY LAW . THIS IS PARTICULARLY SO IN THE CASE OF PRESUMPTIONS OR RULES OF EVIDENCE INTENDED TO PLACE ON THE TAXPAYER THE BURDEN OF ESTABLISHING THAT THE CHARGES UNDULY PAID HAVE NOT BEEN PASSED ON TO OTHER PERSONS OR OF SPECIAL LIMITATIONS CONCERNING THE FORM OF THE EVIDENCE TO BE ADDUCED, SUCH AS THE EXCLUSION OF ANY KIND OF EVIDENCE OTHER THAN DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE .  . THE PRIMACY AND DIRECT EFFECT OF THE PROVISIONS OF COMMUNITY LAW - AS RECOGNIZED BY THE COURTS OF A MEMBER STATE - DO NOT RELEASE THE MEMBER STATE IN QUESTION FROM ITS OBLIGATION TO REMOVE FROM ITS DOMESTIC LEGAL ORDER ANY PROVISIONS INCOMPATIBLE WITH COMMUNITY LAW, SINCE THE MAINTENANCE OF SUCH PROVISIONS GIVES RISE TO AN AMBIGUOUS STATE OF AFFAIRS IN SO FAR AS IT LEAVES PERSONS CONCERNED IN A STATE OF UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE POSSIBILITIES AVAILABLE TO THEM OF RELYING ON COMMUNITY LAW .

Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON MAY 1986, THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT :  ( A ) BY IMPOSING ON THE TAXPAYER THE ONUS OF PROVING THAT NATIONAL CHARGES AND TAXES WHICH WERE UNDULY PAID, AS THEY WERE CONTRARY TO ARTICLES ET SEQ . AND OF THE EEC TREATY, HAVE NOT BEEN PASSED ON TO OTHER PERSONS, BY ACCEPTING ONLY DOCUMENTARY PROOF IN THAT REGARD AND BY GIVING RETROACTIVE EFFECT TO THE NATIONAL PROVISIONS CONCERNED, THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLES 5, ET SEQ . AND OF THE EEC TREATY;  ( B ) BY LAYING DOWN RULES GOVERNING THE REPAYMENT OF COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF DUTIES AND IMPORT AND EXPORT CHARGES UNDER THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY, THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY AND COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1430/OF JULY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL 1979, L 175, P . ).  AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE ORAL PROCEDURE, THE COMMISSION INFORMED THE COURT, BY A LETTER RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON FEBRUARY 1988, THAT IT WAS WITHDRAWING THE SECOND HEAD OF ITS APPLICATION . HOWEVER, IT STATED THAT IT WAS MAINTAINING ALL THE OTHER CLAIMS SET OUT IN ITS APPLICATION, INCLUDING THE CLAIM THAT THE DEFENDANT SHOULD PAY THE COSTS .  THE COURT ASKED THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC TO SUBMIT ITS OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING THE WITHDRAWAL OF PART OF THE APPLICATION AND, BY TELEX MESSAGE OF FEBRUARY 1988, THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC SIGNIFIED ITS AGREEMENT TO THE COMMISSION' S PARTIAL WITHDRAWAL AND STATED THAT AS FAR AS THE PART OF THE PROCEEDINGS NOT AFFECTED BY THE WITHDRAWAL WAS CONCERNED IT MAINTAINED ALL THE ARGUMENTS PUT FORWARD IN THE REJOINDER, INCLUDING THOSE WHICH HAD PROMPTED THE COMMISSION TO WITHDRAW PART OF ITS APPLICATION . CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER ONLY THE FIRST COMPLAINT IN THE APPLICATION .  REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING FOR THE PROVISIONS OF NATIONAL LAW AND COMMUNITY LAW AT ISSUE AND THE SUBMISSIONS AND ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES, WHICH ARE MENTIONED OR DISCUSSED HEREINAFTER ONLY IN SO FAR AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE REASONING OF THE COURT .  THE COMMISSION SUBMITS THAT ARTICLE OF DECREE-LAW NO OF SEPTEMBER ( GAZZETTA UFFICIALE DELLA REPUBBLICA ITALIANA NO OF SEPTEMBER ), CONVERTED INTO LAW NO OF NOVEMBER ( GAZZETTA UFFICIALE DELLA REPUBBLICA ITALIANA NO OF NOVEMBER ) IMPOSES ON THE TAXPAYER THE BURDEN OF PROVING THAT HE HAS NOT PASSED ON TO OTHER PERSONS TAXES UNDULY PAID AND EXCLUDES ANY MEANS OF PROOF OTHER THAN DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE . FURTHERMORE, IN THE COMMISSION' S VIEW, THE FACT THAT ARTICLE IS RETROACTIVE AGGRAVATES THE SITUATION OF INTERESTED TAXPAYERS AS FAR AS THE PERIOD PRIOR TO ITS ENTRY INTO FORCE IS CONCERNED . BY IMPOSING IN THIS MANNER EVIDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS WHICH ARE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCHARGE, THAT PROVISION OF NATIONAL LAW IS CONTRARY TO COMMUNITY LAW AND IN PARTICULAR TO ARTICLES ET SEQ . AND OF THE EEC TREATY .  AS THE COURT HAS ALREADY HELD ( SEE THE JUDGMENT OF FEBRUARY IN CASE 68/JUST V DANISH MINISTRY OF FISCAL AFFAIRS (( )) ECR ), IN THE ABSENCE OF COMMUNITY RULES CONCERNING THE REFUNDING OF NATIONAL CHARGES WHICH HAVE BEEN LEVIED IN BREACH OF COMMUNITY LAW, IT IS FOR THE MEMBER STATES TO ENSURE THE REPAYMENT OF SUCH CHARGES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THEIR INTERNAL LAW . FURTHERMORE, COMMUNITY LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE AN ORDER FOR THE RECOVERY OF CHARGES IMPROPERLY MADE TO BE GRANTED IN CONDITIONS WHICH WOULD INVOLVE AN UNJUST ENRICHMENT OF THOSE ENTITLED . THUS IT DOES NOT PREVENT THE FACT THAT THE BURDEN OF SUCH CHARGES MAY HAVE BEEN PASSED ON TO OTHER TRADERS OR TO CONSUMERS FROM BEING TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION .  LASTLY, AS THE COURT HELD IN THE JUDGMENT OF NOVEMBER ( CASE 199/AMMINISTRAZIONE DELLE FINANZE DELLO STATO V SAN GIORGIO (( )) ECR ), WITH REGARD TO ARTICLE OF THE VERY DECREE-LAW AT ISSUE IN THIS CASE, ANY REQUIREMENT OF PROOF WHICH HAS THE EFFECT OF MAKING IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE OR EXCESSIVELY DIFFICULT TO SECURE THE REPAYMENT OF CHARGES LEVIED CONTRARY TO COMMUNITY LAW IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH COMMUNITY LAW; THAT IS PARTICULARLY SO IN THE CASE OF PRESUMPTIONS OR RULES OF EVIDENCE INTENDED TO PLACE ON THE TAXPAYER THE BURDEN OF ESTABLISHING THAT THE CHARGES UNDULY PAID HAVE NOT BEEN PASSED ON TO OTHER PERSONS OR OF SPECIAL LIMITATIONS CONCERNING THE FORM OF THE EVIDENCE TO BE ADDUCED, SUCH AS THE EXCLUSION OF ANY KIND OF EVIDENCE OTHER THAN DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE .  THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DISPUTE THE ABOVE PRINCIPLES FROM THE COURT' S CASE-LAW . HOWEVER, IT CONSIDERS THAT THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF DECREE-LAW NO DO NOT PRECLUDE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE PRINCIPLES IN THE ITALIAN NATIONAL LEGAL ORDER .  IN THAT REGARD, THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT CONTENDS THAT OWING TO TWO RECENT JUDGMENTS OF THE ITALIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT THE PROVISION AT ISSUE CANNOT HAVE EFFECTS CONTRARY TO THE RULES OF COMMUNITY LAW . IN THE FIRST OF THOSE JUDGMENTS ( NO ) OF JUNE THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT HELD THAT, IN VIEW OF THE PRIMACY AND THE DIRECT APPLICATION OF COMMUNITY LAW, NATIONAL COURTS MIGHT REGARD AS INAPPLICABLE A NATIONAL LAW WHICH WAS CONTRARY TO A RULE OF COMMUNITY LAW . IN THE SECOND JUDGMENT ( NO ) OF APRIL 1985, WHICH WAS CONCERNED WITH AN ISSUE OF CONSTITUTIONALITY CONCERNING ARTICLE OF THE VERY DECREE-LAW AT ISSUE IN THIS CASE, THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT EXTENDED THAT PRINCIPLE TO COVER RULES ARISING FROM INTERPRETATIVE JUDGMENTS OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE . THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT POINTS OUT THAT THOSE JUDGMENTS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT A RADICAL INNOVATION IN THE ITALIAN DOMESTIC LEGAL ORDER, AS A RESULT OF WHICH ARTICLE OF THE DECREE-LAW AT ISSUE IN THIS CASE HAS BEEN HELD TO BE INAPPLICABLE BY NATIONAL COURTS, INCLUDING THE ITALIAN COURT OF CASSATION ( JUDGMENT NO OF OCTOBER ), ON THE GROUND THAT IT WAS INCOMPATIBLE WITH COMMUNITY LEGISLATION . BECAUSE OF THAT INNOVATION ANY NATIONAL LAW AMENDING ARTICLE BE INCAPABLE OF ADDING ANYTHING FURTHER, CONSTITUTING A SPECIES OF "RECEPTION", WHICH WOULD BE BOTH OTIOSE AND CONTRARY TO THE PRINCIPLE OF THE DIRECT APPLICABILITY OF COMMUNITY LAW .  THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT FURTHER OBSERVES THAT THE PROVISION AT ISSUE IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE RULES OF COMMUNITY LAW AND THE COURT' S CASE-LAW INASMUCH AS THE ONUS OF PROVING THAT THE TAX HAS ACTUALLY BEEN PASSED ON STILL HAS TO BE BORNE BY THE NATIONAL ADMINISTRATION . THE TRADERS CONCERNED HAVE THE BURDEN ONLY OF PROVING THEIR OWN ASSERTIONS THAT THE TAX HAS NOT BEEN PASSED ON, WHICH CAN BE PROVED BY MEANS OF THE RECORDS WHICH EVERY UNDERTAKING MUST NECESSARILY KEEP .  THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT' S ARGUMENTS CANNOT BE ACCEPTED . THE DISPUTED ITALIAN LEGISLATIVE PROVISION OBLIGES TRADERS TO PROVE A NEGATIVE, INASMUCH AS, IN THE FACE OF MERE ALLEGATIONS BY THE ADMINISTRATION, THEY MUST PROVE THAT THEY HAVE NOT PASSED ON THE UNDULY PAID TAX TO OTHER PARTIES, WHAT IS MORE BY MEANS OF DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE ONLY . SUCH A PROVISION IS CONTRARY TO THE RULES OF COMMUNITY LAW AS DEVELOPED IN THE COURT' S CASE-LAW .  DESPITE THE ABOVEMENTIONED JUDGMENTS RELIED ON BY THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT, AND EVEN THOUGH IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CASE-LAW OF THE ITALIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT DOES HAVE THE EFFECT OF FACILITATING THE APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE DIRECT EFFECT AND PRIMACY OF COMMUNITY LAW IN THE DOMESTIC LEGAL ORDER, IT MUST BE OBSERVED THAT THE CONTESTED PROVISION IS STILL PART OF NATIONAL LAW . AS THE COURT HAS HELD ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS, THE PRIMACY AND DIRECT EFFECT OF THE PROVISIONS OF COMMUNITY LAW DO NOT RELEASE MEMBER STATES FROM THEIR OBLIGATION TO REMOVE FROM THEIR DOMESTIC LEGAL ORDER ANY PROVISIONS INCOMPATIBLE WITH COMMUNITY LAW, SINCE THE MAINTENANCE OF SUCH PROVISIONS GIVES RISE TO AN AMBIGUOUS STATE OF AFFAIRS IN SO FAR AS IT LEAVES PERSONS CONCERNED IN A STATE OF UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE POSSIBILITIES AVAILABLE TO THEM OF RELYING ON COMMUNITY LAW .  IN THE LIGHT OF THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS IT MUST BE HELD THAT BY IMPOSING ON THE TAXPAYER, UNDER ARTICLE OF DECREE-LAW NO OF SEPTEMBER 1982, CONVERTED INTO LAW NO OF NOVEMBER 1982, THE BURDEN OF PROVING BY DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE ALONE THAT THE NATIONAL TAXES AND CHARGES IN RESPECT OF WHICH HE IS SEEKING REPAYMENT ON THE GROUND THAT THEY WERE UNDULY PAID, AS THEY WERE CONTRARY TO ARTICLES ET SEQ . AND OF THE EEC TREATY, HAVE NOT BEEN PASSED ON TO OTHER PERSONS AND BY GIVING THAT PROVISION RETROACTIVE EFFECT, THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLES 5, ET SEQ . AND OF THE TREATY .
