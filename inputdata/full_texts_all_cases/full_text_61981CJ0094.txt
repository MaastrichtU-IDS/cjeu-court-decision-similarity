Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT BY NOT IMPLEMENTING COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 76/768/EEC OF JULY ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO COSMETIC PRODUCTS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , , L , P . ) THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON APRIL THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT BY NOT ADOPTING WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE     76/768/EEC OF JULY ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO COSMETIC PRODUCTS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY .   BY VIRTUE OF ARTICLE OF THE DIRECTIVE THE MEMBER STATES WERE TO BRING INTO FORCE THE PROVISIONS NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH THE DIRECTIVE WITHIN MONTHS OF ITS NOTIFICATION . IN THIS CASE THAT PERIOD EXPIRED ON JANUARY .    THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS STATED THAT THE DIRECTIVE HAS ALREADY BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MEASURES WHICH IMPLEMENT IT IN PART . NEVERTHELESS IT DOES NOT DENY THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS NOT FULFILLED ITS OBLIGATION TO IMPLEMENT THE DIRECTIVE FULLY WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD .   IN SUM , THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT JUSTIFIES ITS OMISSION BY THE NEED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURE FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMPLEMENTING THE DIRECTIVE . IT PREPARED AN APPROPRIATE DRAFT LAW WHICH , AFTER BEING APPROVED BY THE CABINET ON DECEMBER , WAS LAID BEFORE THE PARLIAMENT AND APPROVED , IN TURN , BY THE HEALTH COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE WHICH TRANSMITTED IT TO THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES FOR FINAL APPROVAL . IN THE MEANTIME , HOWEVER , THE PREMATURE DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT CAUSED THE DRAFT LAW TO LAPSE . THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT THEREFORE IMMEDIATELY RE-SUBMITTED THE SAME DRAFT LAW TO THE NEW LEGISLATURE . THE DRAFT WAS APPROVED BY THE HEALTH COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE ON MAY AND TRANSMITTED FOR APPROVAL TO THE 14TH STANDING HEALTH COMMITTEE OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES WHERE IT IS NOW UNDERGOING FINAL EXAMINATION .   THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES DO NOT EXPUNGE THE FAILURE OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS , OF WHICH THE COMMISSION COMPLAINS . ACCORDING TO ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW OF THE COURT A MEMBER STATE MAY NOT PLEAD PROVISIONS , PRACTICES OR CIRCUMSTANCES IN ITS INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM TO JUSTIFY A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OBLIGATIONS UNDER COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES .   IT MUST THEREFORE BE RECORDED THAT BY NOT ADOPTING WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 76/768/EEC     OF JULY THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY .
