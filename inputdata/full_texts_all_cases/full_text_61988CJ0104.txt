Summary
. The appointing authority is under no obligation to give reasons for a promotion decision either as regards the person to whom it is addressed or as regards the candidates who were not promoted and for whom a statement of the reasons for such a decision, taken in the light not only of the ability and professional aptitude of those concerned but also of certain aspects of their personality, might moreover prove to be prejudicial ( see judgment of March in Case 27/Raponi v Commission (( )) ECR ).  . As the Court has consistently held, the appointing authority has a wide discretion as regards promotion and the Court must restrict its review to consideration of the question whether the appointing authority has used its power in a manifestly incorrect way ( see judgment of December in Case 111/Delauche v Commission (( )) ECR ).  The Court may not, in any event, substitute its assessment of the merits and qualifications of the candidates for that of the appointing authority ( see judgment of April in Case 282/Ragusa v Commission (( )) ECR ).
