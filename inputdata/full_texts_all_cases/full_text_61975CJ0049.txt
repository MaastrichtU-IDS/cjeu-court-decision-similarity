Parties
IN CASE 49/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE SOZIALGERICHT AUGSBURG ( 5TH SENATE ) FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  CAMILLA BORELLA ( NEE LOCATELLI ), OF PIZZIGHETTONE ( CREMONA ),  AND  LANDESVERSICHERUNGSANSTALT SCHWABEN, AUGSBURG,  
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/OF THE COUNCIL RELATING TO SOCIAL SECURITY 
Grounds
BY ORDER DATED MAY RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON THE FOLLOWING JUNE, THE SOZIALGERICHT AUGSBURG HAS REFERRED TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY A QUESTION ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE APPLICATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEMES TO EMPLOYED PERSONS AND THEIR FAMILIES MOVING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY ( OJ ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ) P . ).  THE SAID ARTICLE PROVIDES THAT 'NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ( ), IF THE TOTAL LENGTH OF THE INSURANCE PERIODS COMPLETED UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF A MEMBER STATE DOES NOT AMOUNT TO ONE YEAR, AND IF UNDER THAT LEGISLATION NO RIGHT TO BENEFITS IS ACQUIRED BY VIRTUE ONLY OF THOSE PERIODS THE INSTITUTION OF THAT STATE SHALL NOT BE BOUND TO AWARD BENEFITS IN RESPECT OF SUCH PERIODS '.  THE QUESTION ASKS WHETHER THIS PROVISION MUST BE UNDERSTOOD AS MEANING THAT THE RELEVANT INSTITUTION OF A MEMBER STATE IS UNDER AN OBLIGATION TO PAY BENEFITS TO THE SURVIVORS OF AN INSURED PERSON WHO ARE RESIDENT IN ANOTHER MEMBER STATE AND WHO POSSESS THE NATIONALITY OF THAT STATE, IF THE INSURANCE PERIODS COMPLETED UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF THIS MEMBER STATE AMOUNT TO LESS THAN ONE YEAR, BUT BENEFITS WERE DUE TO THE DECEASED INSURED PERSON ARISING OUT OF THESE INSURANCE PERIODS UNTIL HIS DEATH AFTER THE COMING INTO FORCE OF REGULATION NO 1408/.  THIS QUESTION WAS RAISED IN THE CONTEXT OF PROCEEDINGS THAT RELATED TO AN APPLICATION FOR A SURVIVOR'S PENSION UNDER THE GERMAN PENSIONS INSURANCE SCHEME FOR WORKERS MADE TO THE LANDESVERSICHERUNGSANSTALT SCHWABEN BY AN ITALIAN NATIONAL, THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION, IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT HER HUSBAND, WHO DIED IN SEPTEMBER 1973, HAD WORKED IN GERMANY FROM MARCH TO JANUARY WHERE HE HAD PAID NINE MONTHLY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE OLD-AGE INSURANCE SCHEME .  THE DEFENDANT IN THE MAIN ACTION REJECTED THE APPLICATION ON THE GROUND THAT THE INSURANCE PERIODS COMPLETED UNDER THE GERMAN LEGISLATION AMOUNTED TO LESS THAN THE TWELVE MONTHS PROVIDED FOR UNDER ARTICLE ( ) AFOREMENTIONED .  IT CAN BE SEEN FROM THE FILE THAT ON THE BASIS OF THESE PERIODS OF INSURANCE, THE COMPETENT INSTITUTION HAD GRANTED THE SPOUSE OF THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION A PENSION FOR OCCUPATIONAL INVALIDITY BY A DECISION OF APRIL 1965, WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY CONVERTED INTO A DISABLEMENT PENSION AS FROM JULY .  THE SOZIALGERICHT STATES THAT PARAGRAPH ( ) OF THE REICHSVERSICHERUNGSORDNUNG PROVIDES FOR A SURVIVOR'S PENSION WHERE, AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH, THE DECEASED 'WAS ENTITLED' TO AN INSURANCE PENSION .  UNDER THE ACTUAL TERMS OF ARTICLE ( ) THE LATTER ONLY APPLIES WHERE TWO CONDITIONS ARE FULFILLED, THAT IS, FIRST, THAT 'THE TOTAL LENGTH OF INSURANCE PERIODS ... DOES NOT AMOUNT TO ONE YEAR' AND, SECONDLY, THAT UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF THAT MEMBER STATE 'NO RIGHT TO BENEFITS IS ACQUIRED BY VIRTUE ONLY OF THOSE PERIODS '.  IT FOLLOWS THAT THIS ARTICLE CANNOT BE APPLIED WHERE THE RIGHT TO BENEFITS OF A MIGRANT WORKER OR HIS SURVIVORS ALREADY ARISES SOLELY FROM THE PROVISIONS OF THE LEGISLATION OF THE MEMBER STATE IN QUESTION .  
Decision on costs
THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, WHICH SUBMITTED OBSERVATIONS TO THE COURT, ARE NOT RECOVERABLE AND SINCE, IN SO FAR AS THE PARTIES TO THE MAIN ACTION ARE CONCERNED, THE PROCEEDINGS ARE A STEP IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THE NATIONAL COURT, IT IS FOR THE LATTER COURT TO DECIDE THE QUESTION OF COSTS . 
Operative part
THE COURT  IN REPLY TO THE QUESTION REFERRED TO IT BY THE SOZIALGERICHT AUGSBURG BY ITS ORDER OF MAY 1975, HEREBY RULES :  SINCE ARTICLE ( ) ONLY APPLIES WHERE TWO CONDITIONS ARE FULFILLED, THAT IS, FIRST, THAT 'THE TOTAL LENGTH OF THE INSURANCE PERIODS ... DOES NOT AMOUNT TO ONE YEAR' AND, SECONDLY, THAT UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF THAT MEMBER STATE 'NO RIGHT TO BENEFITS IS ACQUIRED BY VIRTUE ONLY OF THOSE PERIODS' IT FOLLOWS THAT THIS ARTICLE CANNOT BE APPLIED WHERE THE RIGHT TO BENEFITS OF A MIGRANT WORKER OR HIS SURVIVORS ALREADY ARISES SOLELY FROM THE PROVISIONS OF THE LEGISLATION OF THE MEMBER STATE IN QUESTION .
