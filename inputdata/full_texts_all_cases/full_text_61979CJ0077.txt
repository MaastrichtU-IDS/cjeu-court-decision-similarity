IN CASE 77/REFERENCE TO THE COURT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE FRENCH CONSEIL D ' ETAT ( COUNCIL OF STATE ) FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE PROCEEDINGS PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  MARIE-LOUISE DAMAS  AND  FONDS D ' ORIENTATION ET DE REGULARISATION DES MARCHES AGRICOLES ( FUND FOR THE GUIDANCE AND STABILIZATION OF AGRICULTURAL MARKETS )   
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1975/OF THE COUNCIL OF OCTOBER INTRODUCING A SYSTEM OF PREMIUMS FOR SLAUGHTERING COWS AND FOR WITHHOLDING MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS FROM THE MARKET ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION , SECOND SERIES , III , P . ) AND OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2195/OF THE COMMISSION OF NOVEMBER LAYING DOWN DETAILED RULES FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE SYSTEM OF PREMIUMS FOR SLAUGHTERING COWS AND FOR WITHHOLDING MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS FROM THE MARKET ( JOURNAL OFFICIEL , L , P . ).  
Grounds
BY A DECISION OF MARCH , WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON MAY  , THE CONSEIL D ' ETAT ( COUNCIL OF STATE ) OF THE FRENCH REPUBLIC REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING TWO QUESTIONS ON THE INTERPRETATION OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1975/OF THE COUNCIL OF OCTOBER INTRODUCING A SYSTEM OF PREMIUMS FOR SLAUGHTERING COWS AND FOR WITHHOLDING MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS FROM THE MARKET ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION , SECOND SERIES , III , P . ) AND ALSO OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2195/OF THE COMMISSION OF NOVEMBER LAYING DOWN DETAILED RULES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT SYSTEM OF PREMIUMS ( JOURNAL OFFICIEL , L , P . ).   THOSE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED DURING PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF A  DECISION OF THE FONDS D ' ORIENTATION ET DE REGULARISATION DES MARCHES AGRICOLES ( FUND FOR THE GUIDANCE AND STABILIZATION OF AGRICULTURAL MARKETS ) ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' ' THE FORMA ' ' ), WHICH IS THE BODY RESPONSIBLE IN FRANCE FOR THE GRANTING AND PAYMENT OF THE PREMIUMS REFERRED TO IN REGULATION NO 1975/OF THE COUNCIL , TO TAKE STEPS TO RECOVER FROM THE APPELLANT IN THE MAIN ACTION THAT PART OF THE PREMIUM FOR WITHHOLDING MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS FROM THE MARKET WHICH SHE HAD BEEN PAID ON ACCOUNT .   ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1975/PROVIDES THAT FARMERS HAVING MORE THAN  TEN DAIRY COWS MAY , ON APPLICATION , RECEIVE A PREMIUM FOR WITHHOLDING MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS FROM THE MARKET . ARTICLE THEREOF PROVIDES THAT THE GRANTING OF THE PREMIUM SHALL BE SUBJECT , IN PARTICULAR , TO A WRITTEN UNDERTAKING FROM THE RECIPIENT ' ' TO DISCONTINUE FULLY AND FINALLY THE SALE OF MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS ' ' , INCLUDING THE DISPOSAL THEREOF FREE OF CHARGE , AT THE LATEST WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF THE DATE OF THE SAID UNDERTAKING . ARTICLE OF THAT REGULATION PROVIDES THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE PREMIUM SHALL BE UNITS OF ACCOUNT PER DAIRY COW KEPT ON THE FARM AT THE DATE WHEN THE APPLICATION IS MADE AND THAT THE GRANTING OF THE PREMIUM SHALL BE RESTRICTED TO THE NUMBER OF DAIRY COWS ON THE FARM MANAGED BY THE RECIPIENT AT AN APPOINTED DATE . ARTICLE OF THE REGULATION , WHICH DEALS WITH THE PROCEDURE FOR PAYING THE     PREMIUM , PROVIDES THAT ONE HALF OF THE PREMIUM PER DAIRY COW SHALL BE PAID IN THE THREE MONTHS FOLLOWING SUBMISSION OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED UNDERTAKING AND THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) FURTHER PROVIDES THAT :    ' ' THE BALANCE SHALL BE PAID ANNUALLY IN FOUR EQUAL INSTALMENTS IF THE RECIPIENT HAS SATISFIED THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY THAT THE NUMBER OF ADULT BOVINE UNITS HE HOLDS IS NOT LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF DAIRY COWS HELD AT THE DATE OF MAKING THE APPLICATION AND THAT THE UNDERTAKING MENTIONED IN ARTICLE HAS BEEN FULFILLED ' ' .  IN THE EVENT OF ONE OR OTHER OF THE TWO ABOVE-MENTIONED CONDITIONS NOT BEING FULFILLED , ARTICLE OF THE REGULATION PROVIDES THAT :    ' ' IF THE UNDERTAKING SPECIFIED IN ARTICLE . . . IS NOT FULFILLED WITHIN A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF MAKING THE APPLICATION FOR THE PREMIUM , MEMBER STATES SHALL WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO POSSIBLE JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS TAKE STEPS TO RECOVER THE PREMIUM ' ' .  ARTICLE OF IMPLEMENTING REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2195/OF THE COMMISSION PROVIDES THAT :    ' ' IF THE RECIPIENT HAS NOT SATISFIED THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY THAT HE HOLDS THE NUMBER OF ADULT BOVINE UNITS SPECIFIED IN THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1975/THE MEMBER STATES SHALL TAKE STEPS TO RECOVER THE AMOUNT SPECIFIED IN THE FIRST SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THAT REGULATION ' ' .   IT EMERGES FROM THE FILE ON THE CASE THAT , AFTER THE APPELLANT IN THE MAIN  ACTION HAD APPLIED FOR A PREMIUM FOR WITHHOLDING MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS FROM THE MARKET , SHE GAVE ON APRIL THE UNDERTAKING PROVIDED FOR BY ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1975/TO DISCONTINUE FULLY AND FINALLY THE DISPOSAL , EVEN FREE OF CHARGE , OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PRODUCTS AT THE LATEST WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF THE DATE WHEN SHE GAVE THE UNDERTAKING , THAT IS , BY OCTOBER . IN THIS WAY SHE OBTAINED THE PREMIUM IN QUESTION AND , AS PROVIDED FOR IN THE FIRST SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE SAID REGULATION , RECEIVED FROM THE FORMA THE FIRST HALF OF THE PREMIUM . SINCE THE FORMA TOOK THE VIEW , ON THE BASIS OF CHECKS AND INVESTIGATIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES , THAT THE PERSON CONCERNED HAD CONTINUED TO SUPPLY     MILK AFTER OCTOBER , IT TOOK STEPS BY MEANS OF AN ENFORCEABLE DECISION , SERVED ON MARCH , TO RECOVER THE SAID AMOUNT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1975/AND ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 2195/. THE PERSON CONCERNED CONTENDED THAT SUCH RECOVERY WAS NOT JUSTIFIED , HER MAIN SUBMISSION BEING THAT SHE ALTOGETHER CEASED SUPPLYING MILK AS FROM SEPTEMBER AND THAT , HAVING IN FACT CONVERTED HER DAIRY HERD INTO ADULT BOVINE UNITS , SHE WAS OBLIGED TO DISCONTINUE ALL DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN THE FARM , SELL HER LIVESTOCK AND LET THE PROPERTY ON A FARMING LEASE DATED AUGUST WHICH TOOK EFFECT RETROACTIVELY FROM NOVEMBER .    IN VIEW OF THE ARGUMENT PUT FORWARD BY THE FORMA AND CHALLENGED BY THE  APPELLANT , THAT THE RECIPIENT OF THE PREMIUM CONTINUES TO BE BOUND BY THE UNDERTAKING WHICH HE GAVE IF HE DISPOSES OF THE FARM , THE NATIONAL COURT REFERRED TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS :   . IS THE UNDERTAKING REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1975/OF THE COUNCIL AND ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 2195/OF THE COMMISSION GIVEN BY THE FARMER TO DISCONTINUE FULLY AND FINALLY THE SALE OF MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS OF A PERSONAL NATURE OR DOES IT ATTACH TO THE PROPERTY CONCERNED AND WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES , AS REGARDS THE ENTITLEMENT TO THE PREMIUM , OF A DISPOSAL OF THE PROPERTY OR OF THE RIGHT TO FARM THE LAND?   . DOES THE UNDERTAKING ATTACH TO THE LIVESTOCK AND , IF THE DAIRY COWS FOR WHICH THE PREMIUM WAS GRANTED ARE DISPOSED OF , IS THE SELLER ' S OBLIGATION TRANSFERRED TO THE BUYER?    ( A ) THE FIRST QUESTION   IN ORDER TO ENABLE AN ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION TO BE GIVEN TO THE NATIONAL  COURT THE RULES AT ISSUE MUST BE EXAMINED , PRINCIPALLY IN THE LIGHT OF THE MAIN OBJECTIVES WHICH THEY SEEK TO ATTAIN . THE PREAMBLE TO REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1975/OF THE COUNCIL STATES THAT , SINCE THE SITUATION IN MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS IN THE COMMUNITY IS ONE OF SURPLUSES , THAT REGULATION AIMS AT ENCOURAGING THE TENDENCY OF CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF FARMERS IN THE COMMUNITY TO ABANDON MILK PRODUCTION OR THE MARKETING OF MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS AND FOR THOSE PURPOSES INTRODUCES A PREMIUM FOR SLAUGHTERING DAIRY COWS AS WELL AS A PREMIUM FOR WITHHOLDING THE SAID PRODUCTS FROM THE MARKET . VIEWED IN     THE LIGHT OF THOSE OBJECTIVES IT IS THEREFORE APPARENT FROM REGULATION NO 1975/THAT THE PRINCIPAL LEGAL REASON FOR THE GRANTING OF THE PREMIUM FOR WITHHOLDING MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS FROM THE MARKET AND FOR THE RETENTION OF THAT ADVANTAGE IS THE ACTUAL DISCONTINUATION OF ALL MARKETING OF THE SAID PRODUCTS FOR THE PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS SPECIFIED IN ARTICLE OF THAT REGULATION IN RESPECT OF WHICH THE RECIPIENT HAS GIVEN AN UNDERTAKING PURSUANT TO ARTICLE . IN THIS CONTEXT THE UNDERTAKING GIVEN BY THE RECIPIENT TO DESIST FROM MARKETING THE PRODUCTS IN QUESTION IS THE PRINCIPAL MEANS WHEREBY REGULATION NO 1975/SEEKS TO ATTAIN ITS OBJECTIVES SO THAT ANY FAILURE TO HONOUR THAT UNDERTAKING , INVOLVING A DISREGARD OF THOSE VERY OBJECTIVES , MAKES THE GRANTING AND RETENTION OF THE BENEFIT OF THE PREMIUM UNJUSTIFIED AND DESTROYS ITS LEGAL FOUNDATION . IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THE FACT THAT DURING THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PERIOD THE RECIPIENT HANDED OVER THE MANAGEMENT OF THE FARM TO A THIRD PARTY IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO RELEASE HIM FROM THE UNDERTAKING WHICH HE GAVE AND TO VEST IN HIM UNCONDITIONALLY THE PAYMENT ON ACCOUNT AS WELL AS THE OTHER INSTALMENTS OF THE PREMIUM PAID TO HIM , IF THE BASIC OBJECTIVE WHICH REGULATION NO 1975/SEEKS TO ATTAIN , NAMELY THE ACTUAL WITHHOLDING OF THE PRODUCTS AT ISSUE FROM THE MARKET DURING THE WHOLE OF THE PERIOD UNDER CONSIDERATION , HAS BEEN DISREGARDED .   THOSE BASIC FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM IN QUESTION WERE CONFIRMED BY REGULATION  ( EEC ) NO 1386/OF THE COUNCIL OF JULY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION , SECOND SERIES , III , P . ) AND ALSO BY IMPLEMENTING REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2240/OF THE COMMISSION OF NOVEMBER WHICH ENTERED INTO FORCE ON NOVEMBER ( JOURNAL OFFICIEL , L , P . ). THE FORMER REGULATION , BY INTRODUCING FRESH PROVISIONS TO COVER THE CASE OF A SUCCESSOR TO THE FARM OR OF FORCE MAJEURE , MAKES IT QUITE CLEAR IN THE FIRST RECITAL OF THE PREAMBLE THERETO THAT THE ONLY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MAY JUSTIFY NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE OBLIGATIONS UNDERTAKEN BY THE RECIPIENT OF THE PREMIUM , AS FAR AS CONCERNS THE WITHHOLDING OF MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS FROM THE MARKET , ARE THOSE WHICH ARE BEYOND HIS CONTROL , WHERE THE CONDITIONS FOR A CASE OF FORCE MAJEURE WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE THEREOF ARE PRESENT . ON THE OTHER HAND , IN THE EVENT OF A FARM PASSING TO A SUCCESSOR , ARTICLE OF THE SAME REGULATION , WHICH HAS BECOME ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1975/AS AMENDED , EXPRESSLY STATES THAT THE RECIPIENT IS ONLY ENTITLED TO KEEP THE PART OF THE PREMIUM PAID IN ADVANCE IN SO FAR AS THE SUCCESSOR IN TITLE UNDERTAKES TO ' ' ASSUME THE UNDERTAKINGS OF HIS PREDECESSOR ' ' . UNDER ARTICLE OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2240/THE SUCCESSOR ' S UNDERTAKING DOES NOT DISCHARGE THE PREDECESSOR IN TITLE UNLESS THE FORMER HAS GIVEN HIS UNDER    TAKING ' ' TO THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY ' ' . THOSE PROVISIONS MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT , APART FROM EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES , WHICH ARE BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE RECIPIENT , SUCH AS CASES OF FORCE MAJEURE , THE CONCERN TO ENSURE THAT THE SYSTEM IN QUESTION ACHIEVES ITS FULL EFFECT , NAMELY THE WITHHOLDING OF MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS FROM THE MARKET DURING THE WHOLE OF THE PERIOD UNDER CONSIDERATION , IS THE UNDERLYING , FUNDAMENTAL CRITERION WHICH DETERMINES THE CONDITIONS GOVERNING THE GRANT OF THE PREMIUM AND THE ABSOLUTE ENTITLEMENT OF THE RECIPIENT TO RETAIN THE PAYMENT ON ACCOUNT .   FOR THOSE REASONS THE ANSWER TO THE FIRST QUESTION MUST BE THAT THE UNDER-  TAKING ENTERED INTO BY THE RECIPIENT OF A PREMIUM NOT TO DISPOSE OF MILK OR MILK PRODUCTS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1975/OF THE COUNCIL OF OCTOBER BINDS THE RECIPIENT PERSONALLY AND DOES NOT ATTACH TO THE PROPERTY . IN THE EVENT OF A DISPOSAL OF THE PROPERTY OR OF THE RIGHT TO FARM THE LAND , THE RECIPIENT LOSES HIS ENTITLEMENT TO THE PREMIUM AND IS BOUND TO RETURN TO THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY THE PAYMENT ON ACCOUNT AND ANY OTHER INSTALMENT OF THE PREMIUM ALREADY RECEIVED IF THE MARKETING OF MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS HAS NOT IN FACT CEASED AT THE FARM IN QUESTION DURING THE WHOLE PERIOD UNDER CONSIDERATION .   ( B ) THE SECOND QUESTION   AS THE COURT EMPHASIZED IN ITS JUDGMENT OF MARCH IN CASE 84/COLLIC ( ) ECR , THE AIM OF REGULATION NO 1975/IS NOT ONLY TO DISCOURAGE THE MARKETING OF MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS BUT ALSO AT THE SAME TIME TO ENCOURAGE RECIPIENTS OF THE PREMIUM TO USE THEIR MILK PRODUCTION FOR REARING CATTLE INTENDED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF MEAT AND TO EXPLOIT EFFECTIVELY THE CAPACITY OF THEIR FARMS , ESPECIALLY AS FAR AS THE PRODUCTION OF BEEF AND VEAL IS CONCERNED . IT IS FOR THE VERY PURPOSE OF ATTAINING THAT OBJECTIVE THAT THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) IMPOSES UPON THE RECIPIENT THE OBLIGATION TO HOLD , DURING THE PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS OVER WHICH THE PAYMENT OF THE PREMIUM IS SPREAD , A NUMBER OF ADULT BOVINE UNITS NOT LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF DAIRY COWS WHICH HE HELD AT THE DATE OF MAKING THE APPLICATION AND WHICH GAVE ENTITLEMENT TO THE PREMIUM , AND MAKES THE PAYMENT BY INSTALMENTS OF THE BALANCE OF THE PREMIUM CONDITIONAL ON COMPLIANCE WITH THAT OBLIGATION .       THE PURSUIT OF THAT OBJECTIVE DOES NOT MAKE IT NECESSARY FOR THE RECIPIENT TO  CONTINUE TO HOLD DURING THE PERIOD UNDER CONSIDERATION THE DAIRY COWS WHICH WERE ON THE FARM WHEN THE APPLICATION WAS MADE AND WHICH GAVE ENTITLEMENT TO THE PREMIUM . IN FACT ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) AND ARTICLE ( ) OF THE IMPLEMENTING REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2195/OF THE COMMISSION PROVIDE , AS FAR AS CONCERNS THE ' ' SLAUGHTERING PREMIUMS ' ' , THAT , IF THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY GRANTS THE APPLICATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE , IT SHALL TAKE STEPS TO MARK ALL THE DAIRY COWS HELD ON THE FARM AND SHALL PREPARE IDENTITY CARDS OF A GIVEN TYPE IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THEM . ON THE OTHER HAND , ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) OF THE SAME REGULATION PROVIDES , AS FAR AS CONCERNS ' ' PREMIUMS FOR WITHHOLDING MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS FROM THE MARKET ' ' , THAT THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY ONLY HAS TO DETERMINE THE ' ' NUMBER ' '  OF DAIRY COWS GIVING ENTITLEMENT TO THE PREMIUM . THOSE DIFFERENT LEGAL RULES CONFIRM THAT THE OBLIGATION IMPOSED BY ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1975/ON THE RECIPIENT OF THE PREMIUM TO HOLD A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF ADULT BOVINE UNITS RELATES SOLELY TO THAT ' ' NUMBER ' '  AND IS NOT LINKED TO PARTICULAR ANIMALS . CONSEQUENTLY THE SYSTEM INTRODUCED BY REGULATION NO 1975/DOES NOT PREVENT THE RECIPIENT FROM SELLING THE DAIRY COWS HELD ON THE FARM WHEN THE APPLICATION WAS MADE . THE FACT THAT THE RECIPIENT MAY DISPOSE OF THE COWS IN QUESTION IMPLIES THAT IN THE EVENT OF A DISPOSAL THE UNDERTAKING WHICH HE HAS GIVEN TO WITHHOLD MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS FROM THE MARKET DOES NOT COVER THE LIVESTOCK AND THAT THE BURDEN OF THE UNDERTAKING DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY PASS , AS FAR AS CONCERNS THE COWS WHICH HAVE BEEN SOLD , TO THE PURCHASER THEREOF .   THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION MUST THEREFORE BE THAT THE OBLIGATION  UPON THE RECIPIENT OF THE PREMIUM TO HOLD A NUMBER OF ADULT BOVINE UNITS NOT LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF DAIRY COWS HELD AT THE DATE OF MAKING THE APPLICATION IS NOT LINKED TO SPECIFIC ANIMALS . IN THE EVENT OF THE DISPOSAL OF THE DAIRY COWS WHICH WERE HELD ON THE FARM AT THE TIME WHEN THE APPLICATION WAS MADE AND WHICH GAVE ENTITLEMENT TO THE PREMIUM , THE BURDEN OF THE UNDERTAKING GIVEN BY THE RECIPIENT TO WITHHOLD MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS FROM THE MARKET DOES NOT PASS TO THE BUYER OF THOSE COWS BY VIRTUE OF THAT DISPOSAL .  
Decision on costs

THE UNDERTAKING ENTERED INTO BY THE RECIPIENT OF A PREMIUM NOT TO DISPOSE OF MILK OR MILK PRODUCTS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1975/OF THE COUNCIL OF OCTOBER BINDS THE RECIPIENT PERSONALLY AND DOES NOT ATTACH TO THE PROPERTY .

THE OBLIGATION UPON THE RECIPIENT OF THE PREMIUM TO HOLD A NUMBER OF ADULT BOVINE UNITS NOT LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF DAIRY COWS HELD AT THE DATE OF MAKING THE APPLICATION IS NOT LINKED TO SPECIFIC ANIMALS .
