Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Consiglio di Stato – Interpretation of Articles and EC – Opening of new pharmacies
                  – National legislation fixing limits on the basis of the number of inhabitants and laying down the conditions for authorising
                  the opening of a new pharmacy.
               
Operative part 
Article TFEU does not preclude national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which limits the establishment
         of new pharmacies by providing that 
      
–        in towns with a population of fewer than inhabitants, one pharmacy only may be set up and
–        in towns with more than inhabitants, the establishment of a new pharmacy is subject to conditions, such as the exceeding
         by at least 50% of the number of inhabitants needed for a pharmacy and a minimum distance from already existing pharmacies,
      
on condition that such legislation permits, by way of derogation from its basic rules, the establishment of a sufficient number
         of pharmacies to guarantee an appropriate pharmaceutical service in areas with special demographic or geographical characteristics,
         something which it is for the national court to ascertain.
