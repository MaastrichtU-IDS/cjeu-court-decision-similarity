Operative part
Article 36(3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 222/of December on Community transit, as amended by Council Regulation
         (EEC) No 474/of February 1990, with a view to abolishing lodgement of the transit advice note on crossing an internal
         frontier of the Community, read in conjunction with Article 11a of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1062/of March on provisions for the implementation of the Community transit procedure and for certain simplifications of that procedure,
         as amended by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1429/of May 1990, and Article of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2726/of September on Community transit, read in conjunction with Article of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1214/of
         April on provisions for the implementation of the Community transit procedure and for certain simplifications of that
         procedure, must be interpreted as meaning that the office of departure must notify to the declarer the period of three months
         in which proof of the regularity of the transit operation or of the place where the offence or the irregularity was actually
         committed may be furnished to that office, to the satisfaction of the competent authorities, so that the competent authority
         can proceed with recovery only after having expressly indicated to the declarer that the latter has three months in which
         to furnish that proof, and that that proof has not been furnished within that period.
