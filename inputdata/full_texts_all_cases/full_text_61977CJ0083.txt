Grounds
1BY ORDER OF JUNE WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON JULY THE TRIBUNAL DU TRAVAIL , BRUSSELS , REFERRED TO THE COURT , PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY , FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING TWO QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO OF THE COUNCIL OF SEPTEMBER CONCERNING SOCIAL SECURITY FOR MIGRANT WORKERS ( JOURNAL OFFICIEL , P . ) AND OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO OF THE COUNCIL OF DECEMBER ON IMPLEMENTING PROCEDURES AND SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS IN RESPECT OF REGULATION NO CONCERNING SOCIAL SECURITY FOR MIGRANT WORKERS ( JOURNAL OFFICIEL , P . ).   2THESE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED IN AN ACTION CONCERNING THE CALCULATION BY THE COMPETENT BELGIAN INSTITUTION OF THE INVALIDITY PENSION OF AN ITALIAN NATIONAL , MR NASELLI , THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION , WHO HAS WORKED IN ITALY AND BELGIUM .   3SINCE MR NASELLI HAD BEEN DISABLED HE WAS GRANTED AN APPORTIONED INVALIDITY PENSION IN ITALY , AS FROM OCTOBER , APPARENTLY PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF A CONVENTION BETWEEN ITALY AND BELGIUM .   HAVING WORKED AGAIN IN BELGIUM IN AND MR NASELLI FELL ILL AND OBTAINED , AS FROM JUNE , SICKNESS BENEFIT , CONVERTED LATER ON INTO AN INVALIDITY PENSION , PAYABLE UNDER BELGIAN INSURANCE .   5HE FULFILLED THE REQUISITE CONDITIONS IN BELGIUM UNDER NATIONAL LEGISLATION FOR ENTITLEMENT TO AN INVALIDITY PENSION WITHOUT AVAILING HIMSELF OF ARTICLES AND OF REGULATION NO .    6THE BELGIAN INSTITUTION , RELYING ON THE RULES AGAINST THE OVERLAPPING OF BENEFITS LAID DOWN BY ITS NATIONAL LEGISLATION , REDUCED WITH RETROACTIVE EFFECT THE AMOUNT OF THE PENSION WHICH IT HAD PREVIOUSLY AWARDED MR NASELLI AND CLAIMED REPAYMENT OF THE AMOUNT OVERPAID .   7THE FIRST QUESTION REFERRED IS :    ' ' SHOULD ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT THE PLAINTIFF , HAVING REGARD TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE LAW OF AUGUST , COULD NOT DRAW THE FULL AMOUNT OF HIS BELGIAN PENSION AS WELL AS HIS ITALIAN PENSION , ALTHOUGH HIS RIGHT TO HIS BELGIAN PENSION WAS ACQUIRED INDEPENDENTLY OF THE REGULATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY , THAT IS , IN OTHER WORDS , IS THE BELGIAN INSTITUTION AUTHORIZED OR NOT TO APPLY THE NATIONAL PROVISIONS PROHIBITING PLURALITY IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO FOR THE PURPOSE OF REDUCING THE PENSION PAID BY VIRTUE OF THE BELGIAN LEGISLATION ALONE?  ' '   8THE SECOND QUESTION REFERRED IS :    ' ' DOES ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO APPLY ONLY TO A CASE WHERE THE BENEFIT THAT IS TO BE REDUCED BECAUSE IT OVERLAPS WITH ANOTHER BENEFIT OR OTHER INCOME , IS AWARDED BY VIRTUE OF AGGREGATION OF INSURANCE PERIODS , THAT IS , IN OTHER WORDS , DID THE BELGIAN INSTITUTION HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT A FRACTION AND NOT THE WHOLE OF THE ITALIAN PENSION FOR THE PURPOSE OF REDUCING THE BELGIAN BENEFIT ALTHOUGH THAT BENEFIT WAS ACQUIRED WITHOUT HAVING TO APPLY REGULATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY?  ' '  FIRST QUESTION   9THE COURT HAS ALREADY HELD IN ITS JUDGMENT OF DECEMBER IN CASE 140/DIRECTION REGIONALE DE LA SECURITE SOCIALE DE LA REGION PARISIENNE AND CAISSE REGIONALE D ' ASSURANCE MALADIE DE PARIS V CARMELA MANCUSO AND CAISSE NATIONALE D ' ASSURANCE VIEILLESSE DES TRAVAILLEURS SALARIES ( ) ECR THAT THE APPLICATION BY ANALOGY OF ARTICLE AND OF REGULATION NO TO THE CASES REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE ( ) IMPLIES THAT BENEFITS MAY ONLY BE APPORTIONED IF IT HAS BEEN NECESSARY , IN ORDER TO GIVE RISE TO ENTITLEMENT , TO AGGREGATE BEFOREHAND THE PERIODS COMPLETED UNDER DIFFERENT LEGISLATIONS .   10THEREFORE THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES AND OF REGULATION NO DO NOT HAVE BE APPLIED IN THE CASE OF A PENSION ACQUIRED IN PURSUANCE OF A NATIONAL LAW ALONE .   11ARTICLE ( ) OF THE SAID REGULATION READS ' ' PROVISIONS IN THE LEGISLATION OF ONE MEMBER STATE FOR THE REDUCTION OR SUSPENSION OF BENEFIT WHERE THERE IS PLURALITY WITH OTHER SOCIAL INSURANCE BENEFITS , OR OTHER INCOME , OR BECAUSE OF GAINFULL EMPLOYMENT , SHALL APPLY TO A BENEFICIARY EVEN IN RESPECT OF BENEFITS ACQUIRED UNDER A SCHEME IN ANOTHER MEMBER STATE , OR IN RESPECT OF INCOME DERIVED FROM , OR EMPLOYMENT IN , THE TERRITORY OF ANOTHER MEMBER STATE ; PROVIDED THAT THIS RULE SHALL NOT APPLY WHERE BENEFITS OF THE SAME KIND ARE ACQUIRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE AND OF THIS REGULATION . ' '   12AS THE COURT HAS ALREADY HELD , WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO ITS JUDGMENT OF MAY IN CASE 154/BESTUUR VAN DE NIEUWE ALGEMENE BEDRIJFSVERENIGING V H . W . KAUFMANN ( ) ECR THIS ARTICLE , INTERPRETED IN THE LIGHT OF ARTICLE TO OF THE TREATY , IS THE COUNTERWEIGHT TO THE ADVANTAGES WHICH REGULATIONS NOS AND PROCURE FOR WORKERS BY ENABLING THEM TO CLAIM THE SIMULTANEOUS APPLICATION OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY LAWS OF SEVERAL MEMBER STATES AND ITS PURPOSE IS TO PREVENT THEM FROM DERIVING FROM THAT APPLICATION ADVANTAGES WHICH THE NATIONAL LEGISLATION CONSIDERS EXCESSIVE .   13THEREFORE THE RESTRICTIONS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE ( ) ONLY APPLY TO INSURED PERSONS IN SO FAR AS THE BENEFITS ACQUIRED BY APPLYING THOSE REGULATIONS ARE CONCERNED .   14ON THE OTHER HAND CONSIDERATION OF THE OTHER PROVISIONS OF REGULATION NO SHOWS THAT NONE OF THEM PRECLUDES THE APPLICATION TO BENEFITS ACQUIRED BY VIRTUE OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION ALONE OF NATIONAL RULES AGAINST THE OVERLAPPING OF BENEFITS .   15NEVERTHELESS THE BELGIAN INSTITUTION DRAWS ATTENTION TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF THE BELGIAN LAW OF AUGUST ON SICKNESS AND INVALIDITY INSURANCE WHICH READ AS FOLLOWS : ' ' THE BENEFITS PROVIDED FOR BY THIS LAW SHALL BE GRANTED ONLY UNDER CONDITIONS DETERMINED BY THE KING , IF THE INCAPACITY IN RESPECT OF WHICH A CLAIM FOR BENEFITS IS MADE FALLS WITHIN THE GENERAL LAW OR SOME OTHER LEGISLATION . IN SUCH CASES INSURANCE BENEFITS SHALL NOT BE ADDED TO THE COMPENSATION ARISING UNDER THE OTHER LEGISLATION ; THEY SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SOCIAL INSURANCE INSTITUTIONS TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE INCAPACITY COVERED BY THAT LAW IS NOT IN FACT MADE GOOD . IN EVERY CASE THE RECIPIENT MUST RECEIVE AMOUNTS WHICH ARE NOT LESS THAN THE AMOUNT OF THE INSURANCE BENEFITS . ' '   16IT IS FOR THE NATIONAL COURT TO CONSIDER THE QUESTION WHETHER THIS PROVISION IS A RULE AGAINST THE OVERLAPPING OF BENEFITS APPLICABLE TO THE BENEFITS IN A CASE SUCH AS THE ONE IN THE MAIN ACTION OR WHETHER IT IS ON THE OTHER HAND ONLY A PROVISION GRANTING THE RIGHT OF SUBROGATION .   17IT IS ALSO FOR THE NATIONAL COURT TO CONSIDER WHETHER UNDER THIS PROVISION THE REDUCTION OF A BELGIAN PENSION BY TAKING ACCOUNT OF BENEFITS ACQUIRED UNDER THE SYSTEM OF ANOTHER MEMBER STATE IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT INVOKING THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO .   SECOND QUESTION   18ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO PROVIDES : ' ' THE PROVISIONS OF THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH NOTWITHSTANDING AND , SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE SECOND SENTENCE OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE REGULATION WOULD ENTAIL REDUCTION OR SUSPENSION OF AN INVALIDITY , OLD-AGE OR DEATH BENEFIT ( PENSIONS ), CALCULATED ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF THE REGULATION BY THE INSTITUTION OF A MEMBER STATE , THAT INSTITUTION SHALL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT , FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE REDUCTION OR SUSPENSION , ONLY A FRACTION OF THE BENEFITS OR INCOME OR REMUNERATION GIVING RISE TO THE REDUCTION OR SUSPENSION . SUCH FRACTION SHALL BE DETERMINED IN PROPORTION TO THE LENGTH OF THE PERIODS COMPLETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) OF THE REGULATION : IN CALCULATING THE AMOUNT FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES ACCORDING TO THE SAID PROVISION , THE BENEFIT OR INCOME OR REMUNERATION GIVING RISE TO THE REDUCTION OR SUSPENSION OF THE PENSION SHALL NOT BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT . ' '   19IT EMERGES CLEARLY FROM THE WORDING OF THIS PROVISION THAT IT ONLY APPLIES WHEN THE BENEFIT IN QUESTION HAS BEEN AWARDED THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF THE PROCESSES OF AGGREGATION AND APPORTIONMENT .
