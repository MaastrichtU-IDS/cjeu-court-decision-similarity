IN CASE 43/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE TRIBUNALE DI TORINO FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  POLITI S . A . S ., ROBECCO SUL NAVIGLIO,  AND  MINISTRY FOR FINANCE OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC,  
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION, IN PARTICULAR :  - OF THE FIRST INDENT OF ARTICLE ( ) AND ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO OF THE COUNCIL OF APRIL ON THE GRADUAL ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN PIGMEAT ( OJ OF . . 1962, P . ET SEQ .);  - OF THE FIRST INDENT OF ARTICLE ( ) AND THE FIRST INDENT OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 121/67/EEC OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN PIGMEAT ( OJ OF . . 1967, P . ET SEQ .),  
Grounds
BY ORDER OF JULY 1971, RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JULY 1971, THE PRESIDENT OF THE TRIBUNALE DI TORINO SUBMITTED SEVERAL QUESTIONS TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE CONCERNING, IN PARTICULAR, THE INTERPRETATION OF REGULATIONS NOS OF APRIL AND 121/67/EEC OF JUNE OF THE COUNCIL ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN PIGMEAT .  THESE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN REFERRED IN CONNEXION WITH THE IMPOSITION BY THE ITALIAN AUTHORITIES, PURSUANT TO ITALIAN LAW NO OF JUNE AND THE DECREES OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC NOS OF JUNE AND OF DECEMBER 1961, OF A DUTY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES AND A STATISTICAL LEVY ON IMPORTS FROM OTHER MEMBER STATES AND FROM THIRD COUNTRIES .  I - THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT  ( ) THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS THAT, SINCE ITALIAN LAW NO 447, WHICH WAS PUBLISHED ON THE SAME DATE AS THE ORDER MAKING THE REFERENCE, HAS ABOLISHED THE CHARGES IN DISPUTE, THE FILE SHOULD BE RETURNED TO THE NATIONAL COURT WITHOUT ANY REPLY BEING GIVEN TO THE QUESTIONS REFERRED, SO THAT IT MAY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT IS STILL NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE REFERENCE TO THE COURT .  HOWEVER, ARTICLE OF THE TREATY DOES NOT ENTITLE THE COURT TO ASSESS THE IMMEDIACY OF THE RELEVANCE OF QUESTIONS REFERRED WITH REGARD TO THE PROCEEDINGS PENDING BEFORE THE NATIONAL COURT, EVEN WHERE THE DOMESTIC LAW WITH WHICH THE CASE IS CONCERNED HAS BEEN MODIFIED .  IN ANY EVENT, THE REPEAL OF NATIONAL PROVISIONS WHICH ARE ACKNOWLEDGED TO HAVE BEEN INCOMPATIBLE WITH COMMUNITY LAW LEAVES OPEN THE QUESTION OF THE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH INCOMPATIBILITY DURING THE PERIOD PRECEDING THE REPEAL .  ( ) THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT FURTHER MAINTAINS THAT THE CONDITIONS REQUIRED FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ARE NOT FULFILLED, AS THE DECISION ( DECRETO ) WHICH THE PRESIDENT OF THE TRIBUNALE DI TORINO IS CALLED UPON TO GIVE IS TO BE MADE AT THE CONCLUSION OF A SPECIAL PROCEDURE ON THE BASIS OF THE PLAINTIFF' S ALLEGATIONS ALONE, WITHOUT ANY PRIOR DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE PARTIES .  IT IS SUFFICIENT TO NOTE THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE TRIBUNALE DI TORINO IS PERFORMING A JUDICIAL FUNCTION WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE AND THAT HE CONSIDERED AN INTERPRETATION OF COMMUNITY LAW TO BE NECESSARY TO ENABLE HIM TO REACH A DECISION, THERE BEING THEREFORE NO NEED FOR THE COURT TO CONSIDER THE STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS AT WHICH THE QUESTIONS WERE REFERRED .  II - THE SUBSTANCE  THE FIRST QUESTION  THE FIRST QUESTION REQUESTS THE COURT TO RULE WHETHER THE DUTY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES AND THE STATISTICAL LEVY INTRODUCED BY ITALIAN LEGISLATION CONSTITUTE CHARGES HAVING AN EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO CUSTOMS DUTIES WITHIN THE MEANING OF REGULATION NO .  IT IS CLEAR FROM THE JUDGMENTS OF THE COURT OF JULY IN CASE 24/( ) ECR ) AND NOVEMBER IN CASE 8/( REC . 1970, P . ) THAT SUCH DUTIES AND LEVIES CONSTITUTE CHARGES HAVING AN EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO CUSTOMS DUTIES WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLES 9, AND OF THE EEC TREATY AND CERTAIN REGULATIONS CONCERNING THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE AGRICULTURAL MARKET, IN PARTICULAR ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 121/67/EEC OF THE COUNCIL .  THE CONCEPT OF A " CHARGE HAVING EQUIVALENT EFFECT " AS EMPLOYED IN ARTICLES ( ) AND ( ) OF REGULATION NO WHICH PROHIBIT THE LEVYING OF SUCH CHARGES ON IMPORTS OF PIGMEAT FROM MEMBER STATES AND THIRD COUNTRIES IS EQUIVALENT TO THE SAME EXPRESSION EMPLOYED IN ARTICLE ET SEQ . OF THE TREATY AND IN OTHER REGULATIONS ON THE ORGANIZATION OF AGRICULTURAL MARKETS .  QUESTIONS ( A ) AND ( B ), ( A ) AND ( B ), ( A ) AND ( B ), ( A ) AND ( B )  THE COURT IS NEXT ASKED WHETHER THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES ( ) AND ( ) OF REGULATION NO 20, AS WELL AS THE FIRST INDENT OF ARTICLE ( ) AND THE FIRST INDENT OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 121/ARE IMMEDIATELY APPLICABLE WITHIN THE NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM AND, AS SUCH, CREATE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS WHICH NATIONAL COURTS MUST PROTECT .  UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE REGULATIONS " SHALL HAVE GENERAL APPLICATION " AND " SHALL BE ... DIRECTLY APPLICABLE IN ALL MEMBER STATES ".  THEREFORE, BY REASON OF THEIR NATURE AND THEIR FUNCTION IN THE SYSTEM OF THE SOURCES OF COMMUNITY LAW, REGULATIONS HAVE DIRECT EFFECT AND ARE AS SUCH, CAPABLE OF CREATING INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS WHICH NATIONAL COURTS MUST PROTECT .  THE EFFECT OF A REGULATION, AS PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE 189, IS THEREFORE TO PREVENT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY LEGISLATIVE MEASURE, EVEN IF IT IS ENACTED SUBSEQUENTLY, WHICH IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH ITS PROVISIONS .  THIS APPLIES TO THE PROVISIONS IN QUESTION .  QUESTIONS ( C ), ( C ), ( C ), ( C ) AND FINALLY, THE COURT IS ASKED TO GIVE THE DATES ON WHICH THESE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS CAME INTO EXISTENCE, PURSUANT TO ARTICLES ( ) AND ( ) OF REGULATION NO 20, AND ARTICLES ( ) AND ( ) OF REGULATION NO 121/.  THE COURT IS ALSO REQUESTED TO STATE WHETHER THESE RIGHTS HAVE REMAINED IN EXISTENCE SINCE THEIR CREATION UNDER REGULATION NO .  IT IS, THEREFORE, NECESSARY TO ASCERTAIN THE DATES ON WHICH THOSE PROVISIONS CAME INTO EFFECT AND WHETHER THEY HAVE REMAINED EFFECTIVE SINCE THAT TIME .  ( ) UNDER THE TERMS OF ARTICLE OF THE BASIC REGULATION NO : " IN TRADE BETWEEN MEMBER STATES, BOTH IMPORT AND EXPORT ", THE CHARGES IN DISPUTE " SHALL BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE INTRA-COMMUNITY LEVY SYSTEM " AND UNDER THE TERMS OF ARTICLE OF THE SAME REGULATION, " THE APPLICATION OF THE LEVY SYSTEM TO IMPORTS FROM THIRD COUNTRIES SHALL ENTAIL THE ABOLITION " OF THE SAID CHARGES ON IMPORTS FROM THOSE COUNTRIES .  THIS IMPLIES THAT THE PROHIBITION ON THE IMPOSITION OF THOSE CHARGES BY THE MEMBER STATES AND, THEREFORE, THE RIGHT OF INDIVIDUALS TO REQUIRE ITS OBSERVANCE, ONLY CAME INTO EXISTENCE ON THE DATE ON WHICH THE ABOVEMENTIONED LEVY SYSTEMS TOOK EFFECT .  THAT DATE, WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY FIXED AT JULY BY ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 20, WAS POSTPONED UNTIL JULY BY ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) OF REGULATION NO .  AS REGARDS PIG CARCASSES, THE AMOUNT OF THE INTRA-COMMUNITY LEVIES WAS FIXED FOR THE FIRST TIME BY REGULATION NO 50, ARTICLE OF WHICH STATES THAT THAT REGULATION CAME INTO FORCE ON JULY .  ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO AND ARTICLE OF REGULATIONS NOS AND PROVIDE THAT THOSE PROVISIONS - WHICH FIXED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE AMOUNT OF THE LEVIES APPLYING TO PIG CARCASSES IMPORTED FROM THIRD COUNTRIES ( REGULATION NO ) AND TO LIVE SWINE IMPORTED FROM OTHER MEMBER STATES ( REGULATION NO ) AND FROM THIRD COUNTRIES ( REGULATION NO ) - WERE TO COME INTO FORCE " ON THE DATE OF INTRODUCTION OF THE SYSTEM OF LEVIES INSTITUTED IN RESPECT OF PIG CARCASSES BY REGULATION NO OF THE COUNCIL ".  THUS, REGULATIONS NOS TO REFERRED TO THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF REGULATION NO WHICH WAS ADOPTED ON THE SAME DAY AND PUBLISHED IN THE SAME ISSUE OF THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL .  ACCORDINGLY, AS REGARDS LIVE SWINE AND PIG CARCASSES, THE PROVISIONS IN QUESTION CAME INTO EFFECT ON JULY .  AS REGARDS THE PRODUCTS OTHER THAN LIVE SWINE AND PIG CARCASSES LISTED IN ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 20, AFTER POSTPONING ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS " THE DATE OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE LEVY SYSTEM INSTITUTED " BY THAT REGULATION, THE COUNCIL FINALLY FIXED THAT DATE IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 54/63/EEC AT " SEPTEMBER AT THE LATEST ".  REGULATIONS NOS 86/63/EEC TO 89/63/EEC DIVIDED THESE PRODUCTS INTO TWO GROUPS AND FIXED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE AMOUNTS OF BOTH THE INTRA-COMMUNITY LEVIES ( REGULATIONS NOS 87/AND 89/) AND THE THIRD COUNTRY LEVIES ( REGULATIONS NOS 86/AND 88/) TO BE IMPOSED ON IMPORTS .  THE ANNEXES TO THESE REGULATIONS SHOW THAT THE LEVIES WERE TO BE IMPOSED ON IMPORTS EFFECTED DURING PERIODS BEGINNING FOR EACH GROUP ON SEPTEMBER .  THUS, AS REGARDS PRODUCTS OTHER THAN LIVE SWINE AND PIG CARCASSES, THE PROVISIONS IN QUESTION CAME INTO EFFECT ON SEPTEMBER .  ( ) APART FROM CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS THE THIRD PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE BASIC REGULATION NO 121/67/EEC REPEALED REGULATION NO WITH EFFECT FROM JULY .  THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF THE SAME ARTICLE PROVIDES THAT " THE SYSTEM ESTABLISHED BY THIS REGULATION SHALL APPLY FROM " THAT DATE, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CERTAIN MEASURES WHICH ARE NOT RELEVANT TO THIS CASE .  IT FOLLOWS THAT THE PROHIBITION ON THE CHARGES IN DISPUTE, WHICH IS REPEATED IN ARTICLES AND OF THE NEW REGULATION AND, THEREFORE, THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS ARISING THEREFROM, CAME INTO EXISTENCE ON JULY .  THEREFORE, AS REGARDS THE SYSTEM ESTABLISHED BY REGULATION NO 121/67, THE PROVISIONS IN QUESTION CAME INTO EFFECT ON JULY .  ( ) IT FOLLOWS FROM THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS THAT, UNDER THE SYSTEM ESTABLISHED IN REGULATION NO 20, THE PROHIBITION ON THE IMPOSITION BY THE MEMBER STATE OF THE CHARGES IN QUESTION WAS CONCOMITANT WITH THE OBLIGATION TO IMPOSE THE LEVIES PROVIDED FOR IN THAT REGULATION .  IT FOLLOWS ALSO THAT THIS OBLIGATION CAME INTO EFFECT ON JULY OR SEPTEMBER 1963, ACCORDING TO THE PRODUCTS INVOLVED .  MOREOVER, AS FROM THOSE DATES THE LEVIES IN QUESTION WERE APPLIED WITHOUT INTERRUPTION UNTIL JULY 1967, THE DATE ON WHICH REGULATION NO 121/CAME INTO FORCE .  THAT REGULATION IS STILL IN FORCE .  THE REPLY TO THE QUESTION REFERRED BY THE NATIONAL COURT MUST THEREFORE BE THAT THE EFFECTS IN QUESTION CAME INTO EXISTENCE ON JULY OR SEPTEMBER 1963, ACCORDING TO THE PRODUCTS INVOLVED .
