Summary
The question whether it is desirable to hear oral argument from the parties falls within the discretion of the court hearing an application for interim relief. If the suspension sought cannot better remedy the purported non-material damage than the ruling on the substance, the condition concerning urgency is not satisfied. The purpose of proceedings for interim relief is not to ensure reparation for damage but rather to ensure that the ruling on the substance has full effect.
