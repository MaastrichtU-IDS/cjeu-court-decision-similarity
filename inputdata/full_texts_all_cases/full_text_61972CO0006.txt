Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES ORDERING THE SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF ARTICLE OF THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION OF DECEMBER ( REF . IV/26811-CONTINENTAL CAN CY .) APPLYING ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY TO THE APPLICANTS .  THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES $MAKES THE FOLLOWING ORDER .  
Grounds
ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF THE TREATY " ACTIONS BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT OF JUSTICE SHALL NOT HAVE SUSPENSORY EFFECT ". IT CAN ONLY BE OTHERWISE IF " CIRCUMSTANCES SO REQUIRE ". ACCORDING TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF ANY MEASURE IS SUBJECT TO THE EXISTENCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO URGENCY AND GROUNDS ESTABLISHING A PRIMA FACIE CASE FOR SUCH A MEASURE .  SUBJECT TO THE DISCRETION OF THE COURT HEARING THE CASE, ARTICLE OF THE DECISION, AT LEAST UNTIL JULY 1972, MAKES THE EXECUTION OF THE DUTY TO PUT AN END TO THE INFRINGEMENT, CONTAINED IN THE FIRST SENTENCE, SUBJECT TO THE PRIOR REQUIREMENT, WHICH FOLLOWS FROM THE SECOND SENTENCE, TO SUBMIT PROPOSALS TO THE COMMISSION BEFORE THAT DATE . THE APPLICANTS DO NOT THEREFORE APPEAR TO BE REQUIRED TO CEASE THE INFRINGEMENT IMMEDIATELY, BUT ONLY TO MAKE PROPOSALS FOR THIS PURPOSE . IN THE PRESENT STATE OF THE PROCEDURE, THE APPLICANTS THEREFORE HAVE UNTIL JULY TO CARRY OUT THIS DUTY TO MAKE PROPOSALS WHICH, IF THEY ARE SATISFACTORY, WILL PUT AN END TO THE INFRINGEMENT . IF THEY HAVE ALREADY PUT FORWARD SUCH PROPOSALS THEY CAN IN ANY CASE UNTIL JULY FORMULATE NEW PROPOSALS SHOULD THEIR FIRST PROPOSALS BE REJECTED .  THE OBLIGATION TO SUBMIT PROPOSALS IN NO WAY PREJUDICES THEIR SITUATION UNTIL JULY AND THE OUTCOME OF THE MAIN ACTION . ASSUMING THEM TO BE REAL, THE UNCERTAINTIES OR THREATS WITH WHICH THE APPLICANTS ARE SAID TO BE FACED ARE CONSTITUTED LESS BY THE DECISION ITSELF, THAN THE SITUATION IN WHICH THE UNDERTAKINGS HAVE PLACED THEMSELVES IN RESPECT OF ARTICLE . THE SUSPENSION SOUGHT APPEARS TO BE ALL THE LESS NECESSARY SINCE THERE IS NOTHING TO INDICATE THAT THE COURT CANNOT GIVE JUDGMENT ON THE APPLICATION IN GOOD TIME AND DECIDE UPON ANY APPROPRIATE MEASURE .  IT THEREFORE DOES NOT APPEAR, EITHER FROM ARTICLE OF THE CONTESTED DECISION OR FROM THE FILE OR FROM THE ORAL SUBMISSIONS, THAT THE APPLICANTS WOULD SUFFER IRREPARABLE DAMAGE TO THEIR RIGHTS IF THEY WERE NOT GRANTED AN EXTENSION OF TIME AS FROM NOW . CONSEQUENTLY THERE ARE NO GROUNDS FOR DEPRIVING THE CONTESTED DECISION OF THE FORCE ATTACHING TO IT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .  THERE IS THEREFORE NO REASON TO ORDER THE SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF ARTICLE OF THE CONTESTED DECISION .  
Decision on costs
THE COSTS SHOULD, IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES, BE RESERVED . 
Operative part
THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,  BY WAY OF AN INTERIM RULING,  ORDERS :  . THE APPLICATION FOR THE SUSPENSION OF ARTICLE OF THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION OF DECEMBER IS DISMISSED;  . THE COSTS ARE RESERVED .
