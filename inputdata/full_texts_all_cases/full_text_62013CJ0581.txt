THE COURT (Eighth Chamber),
composed of C. Toader, Acting President of the Eighth Chamber, E. Jarašiūnas and C.G. Fernlund (Rapporteur), Judges,
Advocate General: M. Wathelet,
Registrar: A. Calot Escobar,
having regard to the written procedure,
having decided, after hearing the Advocate General, to proceed to judgment without an Opinion,
gives the following
Judgment
By its appeals, Intra-Presse SAS seeks to have set aside the judgments of September in Golden Balls v OHIM — Intra-Presse (GOLDEN BALLS), T‑448/11, EU:T:2013:456, and in Golden Balls v OHIM — Intra-Presse (GOLDEN BALLS), T‑437/11, EU:T:2013:441, (collectively, ‘the judgments under appeal’), by which the General Court of the European Union
         annulled the decisions of the First Board of Appeal of OHIM of June (Case R 1432/2010-1) and of May (Case
         R 1310/2010-1) relating to opposition proceedings between Intra-Presse and Golden Balls Ltd (collectively, ‘the contested
         decisions’).
      
 Legal context 
Council Regulation (EC) No 40/of December on the Community trade mark (OJ L 11, p. 1) was replaced by Council
         Regulation (EC) No 207/of February on the Community trade mark (OJ L 78, p. 1), which entered into force
         on April 2009. Nevertheless, in the light of the date on which the registration applications at issue were filed, the present
         disputes remain governed by Regulation No 40/94.
      
Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/was worded as follows:
      
‘Upon opposition by the proprietor of an earlier trade mark, the trade mark applied for shall not be registered:
…
(b)      if because of its identity with, or similarity to, the earlier trade mark and the identity or similarity of the goods or services
         covered by the trade marks there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public in the territory in which the
         earlier trade mark is protected; the likelihood of confusion includes the likelihood of association with the earlier trade
         mark.’
      
Article 8(5) of that regulation provided:
      
‘Upon opposition by the proprietor of an earlier trade mark within the meaning of paragraph 2, the trade mark applied for
         shall not be registered where it is identical with or similar to the earlier trade mark and is to be registered for goods
         or services which are not similar to those for which the earlier trade mark is registered, where in the case of an earlier
         Community trade mark, the trade mark has a reputation in the Community and, in the case of an earlier national trade mark,
         the trade mark has a reputation in the Member State concerned and where the use without due cause of the trade mark applied
         for would take unfair advantage of, or be detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the earlier trade mark.’
      
 Background to the disputes and the contested decisions 
The facts of the disputes, as set out in paragraphs to of the judgments under appeal, may be summarised as follows.
      
On June and October 2007, Golden Balls Ltd filed applications with OHIM for registration of the word mark ‘GOLDEN BALLS’
         as a Community trade mark.
      
The first of those applications, which gave rise to the judgment in Case T‑448/11, concerned goods and services in Classes
         9, and of the Nice Agreement of June concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services for the
         Purposes of the Registration of Marks, as revised and amended (‘the Nice Agreement’), which corresponded, for each of those
         classes, to the following description:
      
–        Class 9: ‘Slot machines, for use in combination with a screen, video tapes, CDs, CD Roms, DVDs and other disc-shaped sound
         and image carriers, scientific, nautical, surveying, photographic, cinematographic, optical, weighing, measuring, signalling,
         checking (supervision), life-saving and teaching apparatus and instruments; apparatus and instruments for conducting, switching,
         transforming, accumulating, regulating or controlling electricity; apparatus for recording, transmission or reproduction of
         sound or images; magnetic data carriers, recording discs; automatic vending machines and mechanisms for coin-operated apparatus;
         cash registers, calculating machines, data processing equipment and computers; photographic, cinematographic and optical apparatus
         and instruments, recording discs, data processing equipment and computers, computer hardware and software, compact discs,
         mouse-mats, mobile phone accessories, sunglasses’;
      
–        Class 28: ‘Games and playthings; gymnastic and sporting articles not included in other classes; decorations for Christmas
         trees, electronic games’;
      
–        Class 41: ‘Education; providing of training; entertainment; sporting and cultural activities, production of television and
         radio programmes and entertainment programmes, production of motion picture films, theatre production such as shows and theatrical
         performances, production of musicals, organization of music events/concerts, production of games, game services provided on-line
         (via internet)’.
      
The second of those applications, which gave rise to the judgment in Case T‑437/11, concerned goods in Classes 16, and
         of the Nice Agreement, which corresponded, for each of those classes, to the following description:
      
–        Class 16: ‘Paper, cardboard and goods made from these materials, not included in other classes; printed matter; book binding
         material; photographs; stationery; adhesives for stationery or household purposes; artists’ materials; paint brushes; typewriters
         and office requisites (except furniture); instructional and teaching material (except apparatus); plastic materials for packaging
         (not included in other classes); printers’ type; printing blocks’;
      
–        Class 21: ‘Household or kitchen utensils and containers; combs and sponges; brushes (except paint brushes); brush-making materials;
         articles for cleaning purposes; steelwool; unworked or semi-worked glass (except glass used in building); glassware, porcelain
         and earthenware not included in other classes, mugs, glasses’;
      
–        Class 24: ‘Textiles and textile goods, not included in other classes; bed and table covers, towels, duvet covers’.
The Community trade mark applications were published in Community Trade Marks Bulletin No 64/of November and No 8/of February 2008, respectively.
      
On February and on May 2008, respectively, Intra-Presse filed a notice of opposition under Article of Regulation
         No 40/against registration of the mark applied for in both cases, in relation to the goods and services referred to in
         paragraphs and above, respectively.
      
The two oppositions were based, inter alia, on the earlier Community word mark BALLON D’OR, filed on December and
         registered on November under No 4226148, covering goods and services in Classes 9, 14, 16, 18, 25, 28, and of
         the Nice Agreement and corresponding, for each of those classes, to the following description:
      
–        Class 9: ‘Scientific (other than for medical purposes), nautical, surveying, photographic, cinematographic, optical, weighing,
         measuring, signalling, checking (supervision) and life-saving apparatus and instruments; teaching apparatus and instruments;

         or entertainment), production of shows, sports camp services, film production, rental of stadium facilities’.
      
The grounds relied on in support of the oppositions were those set out in Article 8(1)(b) and Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94.
      
On and May 2010, the Opposition Division rejected both oppositions for the following reasons. It found that the goods
         and services covered by the signs at issue were partly identical and partly different. In its view, the signs were visually
         and phonetically different, and slightly similar conceptually for one section of the relevant public. Furthermore, the Opposition
         Division found that, as the signs were dissimilar overall, there was no likelihood of confusion between those signs for the
         purposes of Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/94. Lastly, as regards the ground relating to the reputation of the earlier
         mark, it found that, since the signs were dissimilar, Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/is not applicable.
      
On and July 2010, Intra-Presse filed a notice of appeal with OHIM in each case under Articles to of Regulation
         No 40/(to which Articles to of Regulation No 207/correspond) against the decisions of the Opposition Division.
      
By the contested decisions, the First Board of Appeal of OHIM upheld the appeals in part, that is to say, in respect of certain
         goods in Class of the Nice Agreement and the goods and services in Classes 16, and of that agreement, and in part
         dismissed them, that is to say, in respect of the ‘apparatus and instruments for conducting, switching, transforming, accumulating,
         regulating or controlling electricity’ in Class of the Nice Agreement and the goods in Classes and of that agreement.
         In particular, it found as follows:
      
–        the relevant public is composed of both professionals and average consumers in the European Union, who are reasonably well-informed
         and reasonably observant and circumspect. For the purposes of the assessment of the likelihood of confusion, the public to
         be taken into consideration is the public with a lower level of attention: in the circumstances, the average European consumer;
      
–        with regard to the comparison of the goods and services, the Board of Appeal agreed with the assessment of the Opposition
         Division, which was uncontested by the parties. Accordingly, the Board of Appeal considered the Class goods covered by the
         mark applied for to be partly identical to, partly similar to and partly dissimilar to the Class goods covered by the earlier
         mark. The Class and Class goods covered by the mark applied for were identical to the Class and Class goods covered
         by the earlier mark, and the Class and Class goods were different from those covered by the earlier mark. The Class
         services covered by the mark applied for were identical or highly similar to the Class services covered by the earlier
         mark;
      
–        as regards the comparison of the signs at issue, the Board of Appeal considered them to be visually and phonetically different,
         agreeing on that point with the assessment of the Opposition Division. By contrast, contrary to the Opposition Division, the
         Board of Appeal concluded that, conceptually, the signs were identical or, ‘at the least’, extremely similar;
      
–        in the light of those elements, the Board of Appeal concluded that there was a likelihood of confusion or of association between
         the signs at issue in respect of the identical goods and services in Classes 9, 16, and of the Nice Agreement, and that
         there was no likelihood of confusion in respect of the various goods in Classes 9, and of that agreement;
      
–        the Board of Appeal deemed it unnecessary to consider matters in the light of Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94.
 The proceedings before the General Court and the judgments under appeal
By two applications lodged at the Registry of the General Court on August 2011, Golden Balls brought two actions for annulment
         of the contested decisions to the extent that they upheld the appeals in respect of certain goods and services in Classes
         9, 16, and of the Nice Agreement.
      
Intra-Presse also submitted applications under Article 134(3) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court, seeking annulment
         of the contested decisions to the extent that they dismiss its oppositions in respect of the ‘apparatus and instruments for
         conducting, switching, transforming, accumulating, regulating or controlling electricity’ in Class of the Nice Agreement
         and the goods covered by the mark applied for in Classes and of that agreement.
      
In support of its applications, framed in comparable terms, Golden Balls put forward a single plea in law, alleging infringement
         of Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/94. In support of its applications for annulment, Intra-Presse raised a single plea
         in law, alleging infringement of Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/and Articles 62(1) and 74(1) of that regulation (now
         Articles 64(1) and 76(1) of Regulation No 207/2009).
      
By the judgments under appeal, the General Court upheld the actions brought by Golden Balls and dismissed Intra-Presse’s claims.
         Consequently, it annulled point of the operative part of both contested decisions.
      
As regards the assessment of the likelihood of confusion for the purposes of Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/94, the General
         Court held first, in paragraph of the judgments under appeal, that the Board of Appeal had been correct in finding that,
         in the circumstances, the relevant public was composed of average consumers in the European Union, reasonably well-informed
         and reasonably observant and circumspect.
      
Secondly, the General Court upheld, in paragraph of the judgments under appeal, the finding of the Board of Appeal concerning
         the comparison of the goods and services at issue, which, moreover, had not been contested by the parties.
      
Thirdly, in relation to the comparison of the signs at issue, the General Court stated in paragraphs and of the judgment
         under appeal that the Board of Appeal was correct to find that those signs were visually and phonetically different.
      
As regards the Board of Appeal’s assessment that, conceptually, the signs at issue were identical or, at the least, extremely
         similar, the General Court observed in paragraph of the judgments under appeal that those signs call to mind, from an objective
         point of view and apart from some differences in the details, in principle the same semantic content or the same idea, namely,
         ‘a golden balloon or a golden ball or gold’. In paragraph of those judgments, the General Court added that, for the purposes
         of assessing the conceptual similarity for the relevant public — in particular, for the average anglophone and francophone
         public — due account had to be taken of the fact that the earlier mark is in the French language whereas the mark applied
         for is in English, and the signs at issue accordingly differ as regards the language enabling their respective conceptual
         content to be understood.
      
While admitting, in paragraph of the judgments under appeal, that such a linguistic difference is not sufficient to exclude
         the existence of a conceptual similarity from the point of view of the relevant consumers, the General Court found that, in
         so far as such a difference requires the consumer to make a translation, it is nevertheless capable — depending, inter alia,
         on the linguistic knowledge of the relevant public, the degree of relationship between the languages concerned and the actual
         words used by the signs at issue — of preventing the relevant public, at least to some degree, from making an immediate conceptual
         comparison.
      
In that respect, the General Court stated in paragraph of the judgments under appeal that it was not established that the
         meaning of the mark applied for, comprising the words ‘golden’ and ‘balls’, will immediately be understood by the relevant
         public, namely the general public in the European Union, in particular the francophone public, which understands the French
         expression ‘ballon d’or’ constituting the earlier mark. In paragraph of those judgments, the General Court specified that,
         even assuming that ‘the words “golden” and “ball” are part of basic English-language vocabulary and that they are, therefore,
         as such, understandable for the average consumer, including the average francophone consumer, that does not mean that that
         consumer, who will generally — as the parties agree — have a weak understanding of the English language, will understand those
         words in their specific combination “golden balls” immediately as an English translation of the French expression “ballon
         d’or”, which constitutes the earlier mark’.
      
In paragraphs and of the judgments under appeal, the General Court pointed out differences between the signs at issue
         which militate against such an immediate conceptual comparison. It took the view that the fact that its use of the plural
         distinguishes the sign ‘GOLDEN BALLS’ from the earlier sign ‘BALLON D’OR’ would not go unnoticed by the relevant public, given
         that that is a fairly basic grammatical point which is also capable of being understood and perceived by the francophone public,
         especially as the plural of words is formed in the same way in English as in French. It also stated that the difference in
         the respective positions of the words ‘golden’ and ‘d’or’ — in the one case, at the beginning of the sign and, in the other,
         at the end — as well as the clear difference between the origins of the two words are differences likely to render the immediate
         discovery of the similar hidden meaning of the signs at issue more difficult, both for the francophone consumer and for the
         anglophone consumer with an average level of attention.
      
The General Court added, in paragraph of the judgments under appeal, that, in any event, it appeared improbable that the
         result of such an analysis of the translation would spontaneously enter the head of the average consumer concerned, contemplating
         a simple purchase of everyday consumer goods. This led the General Court to conclude in paragraph of those judgments that
         the Board of Appeal was wrong to consider the signs at issue to be conceptually extremely similar or identical, since those
         signs have, at most, a weak — or even very weak — degree of conceptual similarity for the reasonably informed and observant
         relevant public, in particular the francophone public.
      
Fourthly, the General Court pointed out in paragraph of the judgments under appeal, in the context of the overall assessment
         of the likelihood of confusion, that, even though the goods at issue were identical, the very weak conceptual similarity of
         the signs at issue, for which an act of translation was a pre-requisite (‘prior translation’), was not enough to offset their
         visual and phonetic dissimilarities. Furthermore, in paragraph of those judgments, the General Court stated that the highly
         distinctive character of the mark BALLON D’OR had not been established as regards the goods concerned and that — even if that
         mark enjoys a highly distinctive character and account is taken of the fact that the goods and services in question are identical
         or similar — the very weak conceptual similarity, which depended on ‘prior translation’, could not, in the circumstances of
         the case, be sufficient in itself to create a likelihood of confusion on the part of the target public. Consequently, in paragraph of the judgments under appeal, the General Court concluded that the Board of Appeal was wrong to find that there was a likelihood
         of confusion on the part of the relevant public in respect of the identical or similar goods and services covered by the signs
         at issue, given that the fact that the signs at issue are in different languages creates a manifest distinction between them
         so that the average consumer will not immediately associate them without undertaking an intellectual process of translation.
      
As regards the question whether the Board of Appeal had failed to comply with an essential procedural requirement by not examining
         the ground of opposition relating to breach of Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94, the General Court found in paragraph of the judgments under appeal that the Board of Appeal had considered it unnecessary to examine that ground, notwithstanding
         the fact that the subject-matter of the dispute also covered various goods that fell outside the purview of the Board of Appeal’s
         assessment of the likelihood of confusion. In paragraphs to of those judgments, the General Court concluded, having
         regard to its assessments concerning the comparison of the signs at issue for the purposes of applying Article 8(1)(b) of
         that regulation, that those signs lacked the requisite similarity for the purposes of applying Article 8(5) of that regulation
         and that, therefore, the opposition had in any event to be rejected in its entirety. Consequently, the General Court held
         that the plea raised by Intra-Presse had to be rejected as being of no effect.
      
 Forms of order sought and procedure before the Court
By its appeals, Intra-Presse claims that the Court of Justice should set aside the judgments under appeal, refer the cases
         back to the General Court for a decision on the actions brought under Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94, and reserve the
         costs.
      
OHIM claims that the Court should uphold the appeals and order Golden Balls to pay the costs incurred by OHIM.
      
Golden Balls contends that the Court should dismiss the appeals and order OHIM — or, alternatively, Intra-Presse, or, in the
         further alternative, OHIM and Intra-Presse, jointly and severally — to pay the costs incurred by Golden Balls.
      
By order of the President of the Court of December 2013, Cases C‑581/P and C‑582/P were joined for the purposes of
         the written and oral procedure and the judgment.
      
 The appeals
Intra-Presse relies, in essence, on three grounds of appeal: (i) distortion of the facts in the assessment of the abilities
         of the relevant public; (ii) infringement of Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/(this ground of appeal is divided into
         two parts in Case C‑582/P and into three parts in Case C‑581/P); and (iii) infringement of Article 8(5) of Regulation
         No 40/94.
      
 First ground of appeal: distortion of the facts
 Arguments of the parties
By its first ground of appeal, Intra-Presse claims that the General Court distorted the facts in concluding, in paragraph of the judgments under appeal, that ‘the parties agree[d]’ that the average consumer, including the average francophone consumer,
         generally has a weak understanding of the English language.
      
OHIM contends that no such distortion is evident from the documents in the file and that the General Court’s conclusion concerning
         the level of competence of the French general public in that language is based on well-known facts.
      
Golden Balls maintains that Intra-Presse acknowledged, at least implicitly in its oral submissions, that the relevant public
         has a weak understanding of the English language and contends that the General Court could, in any event, arrive at its conclusion
         regardless of the opinions of the parties.
      
 Findings of the Court
As regards the distortion of the facts alleged by Intra-Presse, it should be borne in mind that, under Article 256(1) TFEU
         and the first paragraph of Article of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, an appeal is to be limited
         to points of law. The General Court has exclusive jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and to assess the evidence.
         The appraisal of those facts and the assessment of that evidence thus do not, save where the facts or evidence are distorted,
         constitute points of law open, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (see, inter alia, the judgments in DKV v OHIM, C‑104/P, EU:C:2002:506, paragraph 22, and Storck v OHIM, C‑25/P, EU:C:2006:422, paragraph 40).
      
It should also be recalled that such distortion must be obvious from the documents before the Court, without there being any
         need to carry out a new assessment of the facts and the evidence (see, inter alia, the judgments in Les Éditions Albert René v OHIM, C‑16/P, EU:C:2008:739, paragraph 69, and Waterford Wedgwood v Assembled Investments (Proprietary) and OHIM, C‑398/P, EU:C:2009:288, paragraph 41).
      
In the present case, it is sufficient to note that it is not obvious from the documents before the Court of Justice that,
         by the assertion made in paragraph of the judgments under appeal and disputed by Intra-Presse, the General Court distorted
         that company’s position concerning the average francophone consumer’s level of knowledge of the English language.
      
The present ground of appeal must therefore be rejected.
      
 Second ground of appeal: infringement of Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/The second ground of appeal is divided into several parts. By the first part, Inter-Presse submits that the General Court
         made an incorrect assessment of the relevant public, in that it only took into account part of that public. The second part
         of this ground of appeal concerns the error of law allegedly made by the General Court in its assessment of ‘conceptual similarity’.
         By the third part of this ground of appeal, which is raised only in Case C‑581/P, Intra-Presse submits that, in its assessment
         of the likelihood of confusion, the General Court omitted to take into account the high distinctiveness of the earlier mark
         in relation to the services concerned in that case.
      
 First part of the second ground of appeal: incorrect assessment of the relevant public
–       Arguments of the parties
Intra-Presse submits that the relevant public is the general public in the European Union with a sufficient understanding
         of both French and English and that the General Court — when comparing the signs at issue conceptually — effectively reduced
         the relevant public to the average francophone consumer. As a result, the General Court incorrectly assessed the degree of
         conceptual similarity between the signs at issue.
      
OHIM agrees with Intra-Presse’s argument regarding the incorrect assessment of the relevant public, to the extent that it
         is directed at the failure to take into account part of the relevant public when comparing the signs at issue. In that regard,
         OHIM points out that the General Court did not state the reasons for which the anglophone public cannot immediately link the
         signs on account of their meaning. OHIM argues that that failure to state reasons did not only constitute a breach of an essential
         procedural requirement, but also led to the infringement of Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/to the extent that no consideration
         was given to the way in which the signs were perceived by part of the relevant public.
      
Golden Balls contends that the General Court always considered the public at large but, for the sake of argument, it considered
         a sub-set of the general public — average francophone consumers — which ‘represented the most favourable scenario for Intra-Presse’s
         case’. Golden Balls adds that there was no evidence before the General Court that any other sub-set of the general public
         would be better placed than the francophone part of that public, for the purposes of the conceptual understanding of the two
         signs.
      
–       Findings of the Court
It should be observed that the arguments put forward by Intra-Presse and OHIM in support of the first part of the second ground
         of appeal are based on a manifest misreading of the judgments under appeal.
      
It does not emerge from those judgments that a part of the relevant public was ignored by the General Court when assessing
         the conceptual similarity of the marks at issue. Contrary to the assertions made by Intra-Presse and OHIM, the General Court’s
         conclusions regarding the degree of similarity between the signs at issue are based on its consideration of all the relevant
         public, including the anglophone public.
      
In that regard, it should be borne in mind that, under Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/94, where the earlier mark relied
         on in support of opposition proceedings is a Community trade mark, the trade mark in respect of which registration is sought
         is not to be registered if, because it is identical or similar to that earlier trade mark and the goods or services covered
         by those marks are identical or similar, there is a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public in the European Union
         (see to that effect, inter alia, the judgment in Armacell v OHIM, C‑514/P, EU:C:2008:511, paragraph 55).
      
In the present cases, in order to assess whether there could be such a likelihood of confusion, the General Court’s first
         step was to make the finding, in paragraph of the judgments under appeal, that ‘the relevant public was composed of average
         consumers in the European Union, reasonably well informed and reasonably observant and circumspect’.
      
Subsequently, for the purposes of assessing conceptual similarity, the General Court relied in paragraph of those judgments
         on the point of view of that general public, ‘in particular the average anglophone and francophone public’.
      
Lastly, after pointing out in paragraph of the judgments under appeal that a linguistic difference between the signs is
         capable of preventing the relevant public, at least to some degree, from drawing an immediate conceptual comparison between
         the signs, the General Court held in paragraphs and of those judgments — without confining its findings to one single
         part of the relevant public — that, because of the differences between the signs at issue, such a comparison would not readily
         be made. Specifically, in paragraph of those judgments, the General Court stated that some of those differences between
         the signs at issue ‘are capable of impeding the immediate discovery of the similar hidden meaning of the signs at issue, both
         for the francophone and anglophone consumer with an average level of attention’.
      
Accordingly, it must be held that, contrary to the assertions made by Intra-Presse and OHIM, the General Court did not reduce
         the relevant public to the average francophone consumer. Their arguments in that respect must therefore be rejected as manifestly
         unfounded.
      
As regards the failure to state reasons alleged by OHIM in respect of the General Court’s finding concerning the perception
         of the relevant public — other than the francophone public — of the two signs at issue, it should be borne in mind that, according
         to the settled case-law of the Court, the duty incumbent upon the General Court under Article and the first paragraph of
         Article of the Statute of the Court of Justice to state reasons for its judgments does not require the General Court to
         provide an account that follows exhaustively and one by one all the arguments articulated by the parties to the case. The
         reasoning may therefore be implicit, on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know the grounds on which the General
         Court has based its findings and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its appellate jurisdiction
         (see, inter alia, the judgment in Isdin v OHIM and Bial-Portela, C‑597/P, EU:C:2013:672, paragraph 21).
      
In the present cases, it is apparent from paragraphs and of the judgments under appeal, inter alia, that the General
         Court analysed the signs at issue and justified its assessment of their conceptual differences, such as might be perceived
         by the relevant public as a whole. It must therefore be concluded that the General Court did not fail in its duty to state
         reasons.
      
In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the first part of the second plea must be rejected as manifestly unfounded.
      
 Second part of the second ground of appeal: incorrect assessment of the conceptual similarity
–       Arguments of the parties
Intra-Presse submits that, in paragraph of the judgments under appeal, the General Court erred in law in its assessment
         of the conceptual similarity of the signs at issue. According to Intra-Presse, the General Court was incorrect to add a condition,
         in order for those signs to be recognised as similar, relating to an intellectual process involving the translation of those
         signs by the relevant public. Intra-Presse argues that the relevant public is capable of identifying the meaning of the words
         ‘golden balls’ and ‘ballon d’or’ and of forming the view that, conceptually, the signs are identical or highly similar. According
         to Intra-Presse, application of the criterion of an ‘intellectual process of translation’ or ‘prior translation’ is artificial
         for the purposes of assessing the conceptual similarity of the signs at issue.
      
Intra-Presse adds that, when word marks are composed of basic words in various languages understood by the public, which is
         the case here, there is no ‘intellectual process of translation’; nor does the consumer engage in ‘prior translation’ or ‘begin
         by translating’. According to Intra-Presse, the meaning of those words would be immediately understood by the relevant public,
         whatever its mother tongue.
      
OHIM submits that the General Court did not predicate the conceptual similarity of the signs at issue on the existence of
         an intellectual process, undertaken by the relevant public, consisting in the translation of those signs.
      
Nevertheless, OHIM shares Intra-Presse’s view that the intellectual process of translation is not a relevant criterion for
         the purposes of assessing whether the signs at issue are conceptually similar. According to OHIM, that criterion is relevant
         only in the context of the overall assessment of the likelihood of confusion. The degree of conceptual similarity between
         such signs does not depend on the more or less immediate connection made by the public between the meanings of those signs,
         but only on their closeness in terms of the idea that they each evoke.
      
Golden Balls contends that the cognitive process of translation is an aspect of the conceptual comparison that comes into
         play when the words for which registration as marks is sought are not in the same language. Golden Balls also argues that,
         by the second part of the second ground of appeal, Intra-Presse is attempting to portray an assessment of fact as a principle
         of law.
      
–       Findings of the Court
As regards the argument put forward by Intra-Presse and OHIM concerning the significance placed on prior translation, for
         the purposes of assessing the conceptual similarity of the word marks at issue, which are in different languages, it should
         be noted that by ‘conceptual similarity’, those parties mean the manner in which the relevant public understands the signs
         at issue. Intra-Presse and OHIM are thus attempting to have the Court re-examine the appraisal of the facts made by the General
         Court in paragraphs to of the judgments under appeal, to the effect that: (i) the signs at issue differ as regards the
         language enabling their respective conceptual content to be understood and (ii) that linguistic difference is capable of preventing
         the relevant public, at least to some degree, from making an immediate conceptual comparison.
      
The Court has held that findings relating to the characteristics of the relevant public and to its degree of attention, perception
         or attitude represent appraisals of fact (see, inter alia, the order in Shah v Three-N-Products Private, C‑14/P, EU:C:2013:349, paragraph and the case-law cited) and that the same is true as regards the relevant public’s
         understanding of the meanings of different languages (see the order in adp Gauselmann v OHIM, C‑532/P, EU:C:2011:433, paragraph 51).
      
Accordingly, as such an assessment is not open to review by the Court of Justice on appeal, the argument of Intra-Presse and
         OHIM in that regard must be rejected as manifestly inadmissible, as must, in consequence, the second part of the second plea.
      
 Third part of the second ground of appeal: incorrect assessment of the distinctiveness of the earlier mark
Intra-Presse submits that the General Court failed, in the judgment in Case T‑448/11, to take into consideration, for the
         purposes of assessing the likelihood of confusion between the marks at issue, the distinctiveness of the earlier mark BALLON
         D’OR in relation to the services in Class of the Nice Agreement and, in particular, in relation to ‘a sports competition’.
      
In that regard, it should be pointed out that Intra-Presse’s argument is based on a manifestly incorrect reading of the judgment
         in Case T‑448/11.
      
While it is true that, in paragraph of the judgment in Case T‑448/11, the General Court did not specifically hold that
         the mark BALLON D’OR was devoid of distinctive character as regards the services at issue, it nevertheless clearly stated
         in that paragraph that, in the circumstances, such distinctive character would not, in any event, affect the overall assessment
         of the likelihood of confusion on the part of the target public. It follows that, contrary to the assertions made by Intra-Presse,
         the General Court considered the possible impact of the distinctive character of the mark BALLON D’OR on the likelihood of
         confusion, as regards the services at issue.
      
It is apparent from all the above considerations that none of the three parts of the second plea can be upheld. Consequently,
         that plea must be rejected as in part unfounded and in part manifestly inadmissible.
      
 Third ground of appeal: infringement of Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/By its third ground of appeal, which is divided into two parts, Intra-Presse submits that the General Court infringed Article 8(5)
         of Regulation No 40/94. First, according to Intra-Presse, the General Court wrongly inferred from the lack of similarity between
         the signs at issue for the purposes of Article 8(1)(b) that there was a lack of similarity for the purposes of Article 8(5).
         Secondly, according to Intra-Presse, the General Court should also have evaluated the application of Article 8(5) in respect
         of the similar or identical goods in relation to which it had held that there was no likelihood of confusion.
      
It is appropriate first of all to examine the first part of that ground of appeal.
      
 Arguments of the parties
Intra-Presse submits, in essence, that the General Court did not correctly assess the conditions for the application of Article 8(5)
         of Regulation No 40/94. It wrongly omitted to assess the effect of the repute of the earlier mark, despite the supposedly
         low degree of similarity between the signs at issue, on the link that the relevant public could make between those signs.
         According to Intra-Presse, it is only where there is no similarity between the earlier mark and the mark for which registration
         is sought that such an examination is unnecessary.
      
OHIM submits that the General Court also infringed Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94, but only as a result of the error
         in law made in the conceptual and overall comparison of the signs at issue.
      
 Findings of the Court
The Court has consistently held that the degree of similarity required under Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/94, on the
         one hand, and Article 8(5) of that regulation, on the other, is different. Whereas the implementation of the protection provided
         for under Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/is conditional upon a finding of a degree of similarity between the marks
         at issue so that there exists a likelihood of confusion between them on the part of the relevant section of the public, the
         existence of such a likelihood is not necessary for the protection conferred by Article 8(5) of that regulation. Accordingly,
         the types of injury referred to in Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/may be the consequence of a lesser degree of similarity
         between the earlier and the later marks, provided that it is sufficient for the relevant section of the public to make a connection
         between those marks, that is to say, to establish a link between them (see judgment in Ferrero v OHMI, C‑552/P, EU:C:2011:177, paragraph and the case-law cited). 
      
According to the same case-law, Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94, like Article 8(1)(b), is manifestly inapplicable where
         the General Court rules out any similarity between the marks at issue. It is only if there is some similarity, even faint,
         between the marks at issue that the General Court must carry out an overall assessment in order to ascertain whether, notwithstanding
         the low degree of similarity between them, there is, on account of the presence of other relevant factors such as the reputation
         or recognition enjoyed by the earlier mark, a likelihood of confusion or a link made between those marks by the relevant public
         (Ferrero v OHIM, EU:C:2011:177, paragraph 66).
      
In the present cases, the General Court found in paragraph of the judgments under appeal that, ‘having regard to the assessments
         made in paragraphs to [of those judgments]’, the signs at issue lacked the requisite similarity for the purposes of
         applying Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94. 
      
However, although the General Court found in paragraphs to of the judgments under appeal that those signs were not at
         all visually or phonetically similar, it also found that there was a low degree of conceptual similarity between them. Thus,
         the General Court did not, in those judgments, rule out all possibility that the marks at issue were similar.
      
Consequently, in accordance with the case-law cited in paragraph above, the General Court was wrong to rule out the application
         of Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/without first undertaking an overall assessment of the marks at issue in order to ascertain
         whether that low degree of similarity was nevertheless sufficient, on account of the presence of other relevant factors such
         as the reputation or recognition enjoyed by the earlier mark, for the relevant public to make a link between those marks.
      
In those circumstances, it must be held that the General Court erred in law in concluding in paragraph of the judgments
         under appeal that the Board of Appeal had been under a duty — even if it had examined the plea raised by Intra-Presse alleging
         infringement of Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/— to reject the opposition concerning the ‘apparatus and instruments for
         conducting, switching, transforming, accumulating, regulating or controlling electricity’ in Class of the Nice Agreement
         and the goods in Classes and of that agreement.
      
Accordingly, without it being necessary to examine the other arguments put forward by Intra-Presse, the first part of the
         third ground of appeal must be upheld and the judgments under appeal set aside to the extent that they dismissed the two applications
         for annulment submitted by Intra-Presse.
      
  The action at first instance
Under the first paragraph of Article of the Statute of the Court of Justice, if the Court quashes decisions of the General
         Court, it may itself give final judgment in those matters, where the state of the proceedings so permits. That is the position
         in the present cases.
      
In support of its applications, under Article 134(3) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court, for annulment of the
         contested decisions to the extent that they reject its oppositions against registration of the sign ‘GOLDEN BALLS’ as a mark
         concerning ‘apparatus and instruments for conducting, switching, transforming, accumulating, regulating or controlling electricity’
         in Class of the Nice Agreement and the goods in Classes and of that agreement, Intra-Presse raises a single plea in
         law, alleging infringement of Articles 8(5), 62(1) and 74(1) of Regulation No 40/94. According to Intra-Presse, the Board
         of Appeal should have ruled on the plea alleging infringement of Article 8(5) of that regulation, in relation to the goods
         referred to above.
      
At the hearing before the General Court, OHIM essentially admitted that the fact that the Board of Appeal did not rule on
         the plea alleging infringement of Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/constituted an infringement of an essential procedural
         requirement. 
      
In the present cases, the Board of Appeal — unlike the Opposition Division — found that the signs at issue were similar overall.
         Accordingly, it concluded that there was a likelihood of confusion in relation to the identical or similar goods and services
         at issue, pursuant to Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/94. It therefore took the view that it was unnecessary to examine
         the pleas raised by Intra-Presse on the basis of Article 8(5) of that regulation, despite the fact that the dispute also concerned
         different goods, not covered by the Board of Appeal’s assessment relating to the likelihood of confusion.
      
In that respect, it should be noted that, under Article 62(1) of Regulation No 40/94, by virtue of the appeal brought before
         it, the Board of Appeal is called upon to carry out a new, full examination of the merits of the opposition, in terms both
         of law and of fact (OHIM v Kaul, C‑29/P, EU:C:2007:162, paragraph 57).
      
In the present cases, that obligation to examine the merits of the appeal must be understood as meaning that the Board of
         Appeal was obliged to decide on each of the heads of claim submitted for its consideration in order to give a decision on
         the oppositions by either rejecting them or declaring them to be founded, thereby either upholding or reversing the decisions
         of the Opposition Division contested before it (see, to that effect, OHIM v Kaul, EU:C:2007:162, paragraph 56).
      
In the light of the considerations set out in paragraphs to above, it should be noted that, in so far as it did not
         give a decision on Intra-Presse’s plea alleging infringement of Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/in relation to the goods
         referred to in paragraph above, the Board of Appeal failed to fulfil its obligation to carry out a new, full examination
         of the merits of the oppositions filed by that company.
      
It follows that the contested decisions must also be annulled to the extent that they dismissed the appeals against the rejections
         of the opposition to the registration of the mark GOLDEN BALLS in relation to the ‘apparatus and instruments for conducting,
         switching, transforming, accumulating, regulating or controlling electricity’ in Class of the Nice Agreement and the goods
         in Classes and of that agreement.
      
 Costs
Under Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is well founded and the Court itself
         gives final judgment in the case, the Court is to make a decision as to costs.
      
Under Article 138(3) of the Rules of Procedure, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) of those rules,
         where each party succeeds on some heads and fails on others, the parties are to bear their own costs.
      
In the present cases, it must first be observed that, although one of the grounds of appeal put forward by Intra-Presse was
         upheld and the judgments under appeal have been aside on that ground, that is not the position as regards the other grounds
         of appeal, which were each in turn rejected by the Court.
      
Secondly, with regard to the action at first instance, it should be noted that, by annulling the contested decisions in part,
         the Court has also upheld the plea in law raised by Intra-Presse. On the other hand, it is apparent from the judgments under
         appeal, which have not been overturned by the Court on these points, that Intra-Presse and OHIM did not succeed in relation
         to the pleas in law raised by Golden Balls at first instance.
      
In those circumstances, and since each of the parties has been unsuccessful in part, both at first instance and on appeal,
         they must be ordered to bear their own costs.
      
On those grounds, the Court (Eighth Chamber) hereby:
1.      Sets aside the judgments of the General Court of the European Union in Golden Balls v OHIM — Intra-Presse (GOLDEN BALLS) (T‑448/11, EU:T:2013:456) and in Golden Balls v OHIM — Intra-Presse (GOLDEN BALLS) (T‑437/11, EU:T:2013:441) to the extent that they dismissed the two applications for annulment submitted by Intra-Presse SAS;
2.      Dismisses the appeals as to the remainder;
3.      Annuls point of the operative part of the decision of the First Board of Appeal of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal
            Market (Trade Marks and Designs) (OHIM) of June (Case R 1432/2010-1) and point of the operative part of the decision
            of the First Board of Appeal of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs) (OHIM) of May
            (Case R 1310/2010-1);
4.      Orders Intra-Presse SAS, the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs) (OHIM) and Golden Balls
            Ltd to bear their own costs at first instance and on appeal.
