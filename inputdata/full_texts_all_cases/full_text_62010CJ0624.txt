Operative part
The Court: 
1.
	Declares that, by providing in Title IV of Administrative Instruction A-9-No of June for an administrative
                     concession derogating from a value added tax reverse charge scheme and necessitating, among other things, the designation
                     of a tax representative by a seller or provider established outside France, the identification of that seller or provider
                     for value added tax purposes in France and the offsetting of the deductible value added tax that he has paid against that
                     which he has collected in the name and on behalf of his or her customers, the French Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations
                     under Council Directive 2006/112/EC of November on the common system of value added tax, and, in particular, Articles
                     168, 171, 193, 194, and thereof;
