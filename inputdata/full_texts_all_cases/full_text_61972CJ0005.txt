Parties
IN CASE 5/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE CORTE D' APPELLO, BRESCIA, FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  FRATELLI GRASSI FU DAVIDE, HAVING ITS REGISTERED OFFICE IN CAVATIGOZZI ( PROVINCE OF CREMONA IN ITALY ), AND  ITALIAN FINANCE ADMINISTRATION,  
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION  - OF REGULATION NO OF THE COUNCIL OF APRIL ON THE PROGRESSIVE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN CEREALS ( JO NO L OF APRIL 1962, P . ET SEQ .);  - OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 120/67/EEC OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN CEREALS ( OJ, ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION 1967, P . ),  
Grounds
BY JUDGMENT OF NOVEMBER 1971, WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JANUARY 1972, THE CORTE D' APPELLO, BRESCIA, HAS REFERRED TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE TWO QUESTIONS ON THE INTERPRETATION OF, INTER ALIA, REGULATION NO OF THE COUNCIL OF APRIL ON THE PROGRESSIVE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN CEREALS AND OF REGULATION NO 120/67/EEC OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE WHICH FINALLY ESTABLISHED SUCH AN ORGANIZATION .  THE FIRST QUESTION SEEKS TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER IN THE PERIOD BEFORE JULY THE PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY AND OF REGULATION NO 19, IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 120/67/EEC, OBLIGED, OR MERELY AUTHORIZED, MEMBER STATES TO GRANT REFUNDS ON EXPORTS TO THIRD COUNTRIES . BY THE SECOND QUESTION THE COURT IS REQUESTED TO RULE WHETHER THOSE PROVISIONS ALLOWED THE SAID MEMBER STATES " ANY RIGHT TO DELAY PAYMENT ".  I - THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT  GRASSI CONSIDERS THAT ALTHOUGH THE QUESTIONS PUT RELATE SOLELY TO THE PERIOD PRIOR TO JULY 1967, THE COURT SHOULD GIVE A RULING ALSO ON THE SYSTEM OF REFUNDS APPLICABLE SINCE THAT DATE SO AS TO ENABLE THE NATIONAL COURT TO COME TO A PROPER DECISION .  ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF THE TREATY IT IS FOR THE NATIONAL COURT AND NOT THE PARTIES TO THE MAIN ACTION TO BRING THE MATTER BEFORE THE COURT OF JUSTICE . SINCE THE POWER TO FORMULATE THE QUESTIONS TO BE REFERRED IS VESTED IN THE NATIONAL COURT ALONE THE PARTIES CANNOT ALTER THE WORDING OF THOSE QUESTIONS . IN THE PRESENT CASE, IT IS CLEAR FROM THE TEXT OF THE JUDGMENT IN WHICH THE COTE D' APPELLO, BRESCIA, DECIDED TO MAKE THE REFERENCE TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE THAT THE NATIONAL COURT HAS ITSELF REACHED A DECISION ON THE QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE PERIOD AFTER JUNE . THERE IS THEREFORE NO REASON TO EXAMINE THE PROBLEMS RELATING TO THAT PERIOD .  II - THE QUESTIONS REFERRED TO THE COURT  ACCORDING TO ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 19, A REFUND " MAY "BE GRANTED ON EXPORTS TO THIRD COUNTRIES . CONSEQUENTLY, MEMBER STATES WERE FREE TO REFRAIN ENTIRELY FROM GRANTING THE REFUND . THIS INTERPRETATION IS CONFIRMED BY ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO OF THE COMMISSION OF JULY IMPLEMENTING REGULATION NO WHICH PROVIDES THAT MEMBER STATES " MAY " ALLOW A REFUND ON EXPORTS TO THIRD COUNTRIES .  AS FOR THE SECOND QUESTION, NEITHER REGULATION NO NOR THE PROVISIONS IMPLEMENTING IT INDICATE THE PERIOD WITHIN WHICH REFUNDS WERE TO BE PAID IN THE EVENT OF A MEMBER STATE' S EXERCISING THE POWER TO GRANT REFUNDS . THIS PROBLEM WAS THEREFORE A MATTER FOR NATIONAL LAW ALONE, SINCE COMMUNITY LAW IS NOT CONCERNED WITH THE PROCEDURE FOR A PAYMENT WHICH IT PERMITTED BUT DID NOT MAKE COMPULSORY .  ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 120/67, TO WHICH REFERENCE IS ALSO MADE BY THE NATIONAL COURT, HAS NO BEARING ON THE SYSTEM APPLICABLE BEFORE JULY . IN FACT, ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF THE SAID REGULATION, THE SYSTEM WHICH IT PRESCRIBES IS APPLICABLE ONLY AS FROM JULY 1967, THE DATE OF REPEAL OF REGULATION NO AND ITS IMPLEMENTING PROVISIONS . CONSEQUENTLY, IN SO FAR AS THE SYSTEM INSTITUTED BY REGULATION NO 120/DIFFERS FROM THAT RESULTING FROM REGULATION NO 19, THE NEW RULES RELATE SOLELY TO COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS EFFECTED AFTER JUNE .  
Decision on costs
THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC AND BY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, WHICH HAVE SUBMITTED OBSERVATIONS TO THE COURT, ARE NOT RECOVERABLE AND AS THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE, IN SO FAR AS THE PARTIES TO THE MAIN ACTION ARE CONCERNED, IN THE NATURE OF A STEP IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THE NATIONAL COURT, COSTS ARE A MATTER FOR THAT COURT .
