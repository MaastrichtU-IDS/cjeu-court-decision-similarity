Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Curtea de Appel Bacău Comercială, Contencios Administrativ şi Fiscal – Registration of
                  second-hand vehicles previously registered in other Member States – Environmental tax on motor vehicles on first registration
                  in a Member State – Compatibility of national legislation with Article TFEU – Discrimination in relation to second-hand
                  vehicles already registered in that Member State and not subject to that tax on subsequent sale and new registration.
               
Operative part
Article TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a Member State from introducing a pollution tax levied on motor vehicles
         on their first registration in that Member State if that tax is arranged in such a way as to discourage the putting into circulation
         in that Member State of second-hand vehicles purchased in other Member States without discouraging the purchase of second-hand
         vehicles of the same age and condition on the domestic market.
