Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE REFUSAL OF THE COMMISSION TO SET UP AN INVALIDITY COMMITTEE FOR THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS AND FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION TO APPLY ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS TO THE APPLICANT, 
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION BROUGHT ON JUNE IN CASE 42/74, THE APPLICANT REQUESTED THE COURT TO ANNUL A DECISION OF THE COMMISSION OF APRIL WHEREBY IT REJECTED HIS REQUEST THAT IT SHOULD APPOINT AN INVALIDITY COMMITTEE WITH THE DUTY OF ESTABLISHING CAUSES OF HIS ILLNESS AND, IF NECESSARY, DETERMINING THE DEGREE OF INVALIDITY .  THIS REQUEST HAD BEEN MADE AFTER AN INVALIDITY COMMITTEE SET UP BY THE COMMISSION IN TO EXAMINE THE APPLICANT HAD SUBMITTED ITS CONCLUSIONS, THE VALIDITY OF WHICH THE APPLICANT, HOWEVER, CONTESTS .  BY APPLICATION BROUGHT ON AUGUST IN CASE 62/74, THE APPLICANT REQUESTED THE COURT TO ANNUL THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION OF APRIL WHEREBY, IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS, ANY ABSENCE ON HIS PART WAS TO BE DEDUCTED FROM HIS ANNUAL LEAVE AND THEREAFTER SET AGAINST HIS SALARY .  THE REQUEST FOR ANNULMENT IS BASED IN PARTICULAR ON THE ALLEGED INAPPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS TO THE APPLICANT SINCE HE CLAIMS THAT HIS ABSENCE WAS NOT UNAUTHORIZED BUT WAS DUE TO SICKNESS .  THE COURT RULED THAT THE TWO CASES SHOULD BE JOINED FOR THE PROCEDURE AND JUDGMENT AND DID NOT GRANT THE REQUEST SUBMITTED BY THE COMMISSION IN CASE 42/FOR THE COURT TO GIVE A RULING ON THE OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY WHICH THE COMMISSION RAISED WITHOUT THE COURT'S GOING INTO THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CASE .  THE TWO APPLICATIONS RAISE THE COMMON PROBLEM WHETHER THE COMMISSION, EITHER BY REJECTING THE APPLICANT'S REQUEST TO SET UP A NEW INVALIDITY COMMITTEE OR BY REFUSING TO CONSIDER THE APPLICANT'S ABSENCE AS JUSTIFIED BY SICKNESS, VALIDLY BASED ITS DECISION ON THE CONCLUSIONS SET OUT BY THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE SET UP IN .  IN THIS CONNEXION, THE APPLICANT CLAIMS THAT THE CONCLUSION OF THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE CANNOT BE CONSIDERED VALID SINCE THEY ARE NOT THE JOINT WORK OF THE THREE DOCTORS MEETING AS A COMMITTEE, AS THE MEMBER APPOINTED BY THE APPLICANT REFUSED TO SIGN THEM .  A MEMBER OF AN INVALIDITY COMMITTEE, APPOINTED BY ONE OF THE PARTIES, CANNOT, BY HIS REFUSAL TO SIGN, BLOCK THE PROCEDURE PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE AND MAKE THE APPLICATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS IMPOSSIBLE .  THE STAFF REGULATIONS, BY PROVIDING FOR A COMPOSITION OF THREE MEMBERS, IMPLY THAT IN THE EVENT OF DISAGREEMENT THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE MAY DECIDE BY A MAJORITY .  THE CONCLUSIONS REPRESENTING THE OPINION OF THE MAJORITY OF THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE, MUST THEREFORE BE CONSIDERED VALID WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  THE APPLICANT CLAIMS MOREOVER IN CASE 62/THAT THE CONCLUSIONS REACHED IN CANNOT CONTAIN AN OPINION ON A DISPUTE WHICH AROSE IN .  IN THIS CONNEXION, THE TERMS OF THE DUTIES WITH WHICH THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE WAS ENTRUSTED AND THE IMPLICATION OF ITS FINDINGS, TOGETHER WITH THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF THE DISPUTE MUST BE KEPT IN VIEW .  THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE'S TERMS OF REFERENCE WERE INTER ALIA TO DECIDE 'WHETHER THE PERSON CONCERNED IS SUFFERING FROM PARTIAL PERMANENT INVALIDITY WHICH RENDERS HIM CAPABLE OR INCAPABLE OF PERFORMING THE DUTIES WHICH CORRESPOND TO A POST IN HIS CAREER BRACKET '.  THE COMMITTEE WAS FULLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE DUTIES WHICH THE APPLICANT WAS CALLED UPON TO PERFORM .  THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE, IN ITS CONCLUSIONS OF MARCH 1973, ASSESSED THE PARTIAL PERMANENT INVALIDITY OF THE APPLICANT AT PER CENT .  THE TWO DOCTORS WHO SIGNED THE CONCLUSIONS DECLARED IN LETTERS OF AND JUNE THAT IN VIEW OF THE EXAMINATIONS WHICH HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT, THE APPLICANT 'IS FIT TO PERFORM THE DUTIES CORRESPONDING TO HIS GRADE '.  BY LETTER OF AUGUST SIGNED BY THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL FOR PERSONNEL OF THE COMMISSION, THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE AND THE LETTER OF JUNE MENTIONED ABOVE, WERE SENT TO THE APPLICANT .  ON THE OTHER HAND, NONE OF THE MEDICAL CERTIFICATES PRODUCED BY THE APPLICANT TO JUSTIFY HIS ABSENCE FOR LONG PERIODS SHOWED A DIAGNOSIS OTHER THAN THAT WHICH LED TO HIS CASE BEING REFERRED TO THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE AND WHICH, IN THE OPINION OF TWO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, WAS NOT SUCH AS TO PREVENT HIM FROM PERFORMING THE DUTIES ASSIGNED TO HIM .  MOREOVER, THE MEMBERS OF THE MEDICAL SERVICE OF THE COMMISSION, AFTER EXAMINING THE APPLICANT, REACHED THE VERY SAME CONCLUSIONS AS THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE .  IT FOLLOWS FROM THIS THAT THE APPLICANT'S ABSENCES CANNOT BE CONSIDERED JUSTIFIED BY SICKNESS, SO THAT THE COMMISSION WAS RIGHT TO CONSIDER THEM UNAUTHORIZED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  HOWEVER, THE APPLICANT CLAIMS IN ADDITION THAT IN ANY CASE THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE IS INVALID BECAUSE THE MATTER WAS NOT REFERRED TO THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE FOR ITS OPINION AS PROVIDED BY ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS FOR CASES 'IN DISPUTE '.  HE SAYS THAT THERE IS A DISPUTE WITHIN THE MEANING OF THIS PROVISION WHENEVER THE COMMISSION DOES NOT ACCEPT A MEDICAL CERTIFICATE CERTIFYING THE OFFICIAL'S ILLNESS WHICH HAS BEEN PRODUCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ).  THE COMMISSION FOR ITS PART EXPRESSED RESERVATIONS AS TO WHETHER SUCH AN INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE ( ) IS WELL-FOUNDED AND CLAIMED IN PARTICULAR THAT THIS PROVISION ONLY APPEARS TO APPLY TO DISPUTES ABOUT COMPULSORY LEAVE .  WHATEVER THE CORRECT INTERPRETATION OF THE PROVISION IN QUESTION, ITS APPLICATION NECESSARILY PRESUPPOSES THE EXISTENCE OF A DISPUTE WHICH HAS NOT BEEN FINALLY RESOLVED .  IN THE PRESENT CASE, THE POINT BEING CONTESTED WAS ALREADY VALIDLY DECIDED BY THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE, SINCE THE MEDICAL CERTIFICATES PRODUCED BY THE APPLICANT DID NOT REVEAL ANY NEW FACTOR CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HIS ILLNESS OR HIS FITNESS FOR WORK .  IT FOLLOWS FROM THIS THAT THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY DISPUTE WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO THE INVALIDITY COMMITTEE FOR AN OPINION .  IT FOLLOWS FROM ALL THE FOREGOING THAT NEITHER THE REFUSAL OF THE COMMISSION TO SET UP A NEW INVALIDITY COMMITTEE NOR ITS DECISION ON THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS TO THE APPLICANT CONTAIN SUCH DEFECTS AS TO ENTAIL THEIR ANNULMENT AND THAT THE TWO APPLICATIONS MUST THEREFORE BE DISMISSED .  
Decision on costs

HOWEVER, UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, COSTS INCURRED BY INSTITUTIONS IN PROCEEDINGS BY SERVANTS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES SHALL BE BORNE BY THE FORMER .  ON THOSE GROUNDS,
