Grounds
UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE ANY SUSPENSION OF OPERATION IS SUBJECT TO THE EXISTENCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO URGENCY AND OF GROUNDS ESTABLISHING A PRIMA FACIE CASE FOR SUCH A MEASURE .   AS TO THE NATURE OF THE MEASURE APPLIED FOR , PROVISIONAL ADMISSION TO THE TESTS IN QUESTION WOULD AMOUNT NOT TO A SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF THE CONTESTED MEASURE BUT TO A COMPLETE REVERSAL , EVEN THOUGH ONLY PROVISIONAL , OF SUCH A NATURE AS TO DENUDE THE MAIN ACTION OF ITS PURPOSE .   THEREFORE THE COURT HAS JURISDICTION ONLY TO SUSPEND , IF NECESSARY , THE ENGAGEMENT PROCEDURE IN PROGRESS .   SUCH A SUSPENSION WOULD INVOLVE SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES FOR THE DEFENDANT , SINCE THE PROCEDURE , AS SET FORTH IN THE DEFENDANT ' S UNDISPUTED STATEMENT , IS AIMED AT TEMPORARILY FILLING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THREE VACANT POSTS IN A SECTION WHICH COMPRISES EIGHT POSTS IN ALL .   FURTHERMORE ANY SUCH SUSPENSION WOULD ALSO INVOLVE SERIOUS INCONVENIENCE FOR THE OTHER CANDIDATES .   IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES , IT IS NECESSARY , UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE , TO EXAMINE ' THE FACTUAL AND LEGAL GROUNDS ESTABLISHING A PRIMA FACIE CASE FOR THE . . . MEASURES '  APPLIED FOR .   TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY WERE SET OUT AT THE HEARING , THE GROUNDS ALLEGED RAISE TWO QUESTIONS , FIRST WHETHER ARTICLE OF ANNEX III TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS APPLIES , IF ONLY BY ANALOGY , TO THE PROCEDURE IN DISPUTE , AND SECONDLY WHETHER THAT PROVISION REQUIRES THAT THE DECISIONS REFERRED TO IN THE FOURTH PARAGRAPH - WHICH THE CONTESTED DECISION MIGHT BE REGARDED AS RESEMBLING - SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS ON WHICH THEY ARE BASED .   IN VIEW FIRST OF THE DISADVANTAGES OF A SUSPENSION AND SECONDLY OF THE QUESTIONABLE NATURE OF THE GROUNDS ALLEGED , THERE IS NO CASE FOR SUSPENDING THE PROCEDURE .   THEREFORE THE APPLICATION MUST BE DISMISSED .
