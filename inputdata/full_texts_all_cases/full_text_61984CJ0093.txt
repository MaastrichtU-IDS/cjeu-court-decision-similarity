Subject of the case
APPLICATION UNDER THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT , BY FAILING TO COMPLY WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD WITH THE COMMISSION DECISION OF FEBRUARY CONCERNING AID TO MAINTAIN MARITIME EMPLOYMENT GRANTED TO FISHING UNDERTAKINGS , THE FRENCH REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL AN OBLIGATION UNDER THE TREATY , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON APRIL , THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT , BY FAILING TO COMPLY WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD WITH COMMISSION DECISION NO 83/313/EEC OF FEBRUARY CONCERNING AID TO MAINTAIN MARITIME EMPLOYMENT GRANTED TO FISHING UNDERTAKINGS BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), THE FRENCH REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL AN OBLIGATION UNDER THE TREATY .   ACCORDING TO THE RECITALS IN THE PREAMBLE TO THAT DECISON , THE CONTESTED AID AMOUNTED IN PRACTICE TO A SUBSIDY OF FF 0.FOR EACH LITRE OF GAS-OIL USED AND WAS GRANTED TO ALL FISHING UNDERTAKINGS . THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT EXPLAINED THAT THE REFERENCE TO FUEL WAS USED MERELY AS A CRITERION FOR GRANTING THE AID AND THAT THE AID IN QUESTION WAS TO BE REGARDED AS EMPLOYMENT AID . ITS PURPOSE WAS TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS ON THE FISHING FLEETS OF THE SPECTACULAR INCREASE IN RUNNING COSTS , OF DWINDLING CATCHES AND OF THE REDEPLOYMENT OF FISHING ACTIVITIES .   ACCORDING TO THE SAME RECITALS , IT EMERGED THAT THAT AID HAD BEEN GRANTED REGULARLY IN FRANCE SINCE , THAT THE GRANT OF THE AID IN AND HAD BEEN AUTHORIZED BY THE COMMISSION AND THAT THE LATTER HAD RAISED NO OBJECTIONS TO ITS RENEWAL IN . HOWEVER , THE COMMISSION DECIDED IN TO INITIATE THE PROCEDURE PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TREATY ON THE GROUND THAT THE AID IN QUESTION WAS AT THE TIME NO LONGER TEMPORARY AID BUT OPERATING AID GRANTED WITHOUT ANY RECIPROCAL COMMITMENT ON THE PART OF THE RECIPIENT AND THAT THE GRANT OF SUCH AID HAD A SUBSTANTIAL DIRECT IMPACT ON TRADE BETWEEN THE MEMBER STATES . WHILE THAT PROCEDURE WAS IN PROGRESS , IN DECEMBER , THE COMMISSION LEARNED THAT THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT HAD DECIDED TO DOUBLE THE AID IN QUESTION WITH EFFECT FROM JULY AND ASKED THAT GOVERNMENT FOR CONFIRMATION ; THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT CONFIRMED THAT INFORMATION AND , IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE ( ) OF     THE TREATY , NOTIFIED THE EXTENSION AND THE DOUBLING OF THE AID IN QUESTION FOR . THE COMMISSION DECIDED TO INITIATE THE PROCEDURE PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TREATY ALSO IN RESPECT OF THAT AID .   ON COMPLETION OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PROCEDURES , THE COMMISSION ADOPTED DECISION NO 83/IN WHICH IT STATED THAT THE AID IN QUESTION , AS GRANTED IN FRANCE FROM TO , WAS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE COMMON MARKET WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY , THAT CONSEQUENTLY SUCH AID WAS NO LONGER TO BE GRANTED AND THAT THE FRENCH REPUBLIC , TO WHICH THE DECISION WAS ADDRESSED , WAS TO INFORM THE COMMISSION WITHIN ONE MONTH OF THE NOTIFICATION OF THE DECISION - WHICH TOOK PLACE ON APRIL - OF THE MEASURES TAKEN TO COMPLY THEREWITH .   AFTER IT HAD SOUGHT AND OBTAINED AN ADDITIONAL PERIOD IN WHICH TO INFORM THE COMMISSION OF THE MEASURES ADOPTED , THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT NOTIFIED THE COMMISSION THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AID HAD HELPED TO BRING ABOUT FAR-REACHING STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN THE FISHERIES SECTOR , THAT IT HAD NOT HINDERED TRADE IN FISHERY PRODUCTS BETWEEN THE MEMBER STATES AND , FINALLY , THAT IT DID NOT IN ANY WAY CONSTITUTE A DISTORTION OF COMPETITION .   IN THE LIGHT OF THAT REPLY , THE COMMISSION NOTIFIED THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT THAT THE INFORMATION PROVIDED WAS NOT SUCH AS TO BRING ABOUT A CHANGE IN THE COMMISSION ' S POSITION AND THAT IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THE DECISION ADOPTED WAS STILL VALID IN EVERY RESPECT . THE COMMISSION REQUESTED THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT TO NOTIFY IT WITHIN FOUR WEEKS OF THE MEASURES ADOPTED TO COMPLY WITH THE DECISION IN QUESTION . IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY RESPONSE FROM THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT , THE COMMISSION INSTITUTED THESE PROCEEDINGS .   IN ITS DEFENCE , THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT CONTENDS THAT THE COMMISSION HAS FAILED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE CONTESTED AID HAS AN EFFECT ON TRADE BETWEEN FRANCE AND THE OTHER MEMBER STATES OR THAT IT DISTORTS , OR THREATENS TO DISTORT , COMPETITION WITHIN THE COMMUNITY . ON THE CONTRARY , THE AID HAS NOT PRODUCED ANY EFFECTS WHICH RENDER IT INCOMPATIBLE WITH ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TREATY .   THE COMMISSION MAINTAINS THAT THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT ' S DEFENCE AMOUNTS TO CALLING IN QUESTION THE LEGALITY OF DECISION NO 83/, ALTHOUGH THAT GOVERNMENT     HAD ALLOWED THE TWO-MONTH PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF NOTIFICATION , PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE OF THE TREATY , TO EXPIRE WITHOUT CONTESTING THE LEGALITY OF THE DECISION BY THE MEANS AVAILABLE UNDER THAT ARTICLE .   THE COMMISSION ' S POINT OF VIEW MUST BE UPHELD . UNDER ARTICLE OF THE TREATY , A DECISION IS BINDING IN ITS ENTIRETY UPON THOSE TO WHOM IT IS ADDRESSED . THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT DID NOT CHALLENGE DECISION NO 83/IN DUE TIME AND , AS THE COURT EXPLAINED IN ITS JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER IN CASE 156/( COMMISSION V BELGIUM ( ) ECR ), IT IS THEREFORE BARRED IN THESE PROCEEDINGS FROM CHALLENGING THE FACTUAL AND LEGAL FINDINGS ON WHICH THE COMMISSION BASED ITS DECISION .   IT MUST THEREFORE BE HELD , WITHOUT THERE BEING ANY NEED TO CONSIDER THE ARGUMENTS PUT FORWARD BY THE DEFENDANT , THAT BY FAILING TO COMPLY WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD WITH COMMISSION DECISION NO 83/OF FEBRUARY CONCERNING AID TO MAINTAIN MARITIME EMPLOYMENT GRANTED TO FISHING UNDERTAKINGS BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT , THE FRENCH REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL AN OBLIGATION UNDER THE TREATY .
