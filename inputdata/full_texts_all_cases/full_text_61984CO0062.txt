Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF COMMISSION DECISION NO C() 104/OF JANUARY CONCERNING A FINE IMPOSED ON THE APPLICANT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY , 
Grounds
ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY ACTIONS BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT DO NOT HAVE SUSPENSORY EFFECT . THE COURT MAY , HOWEVER , IF IT CONSIDERS THAT CIRCUMSTANCES SO REQUIRE , ORDER THAT APPLICATION OF THE CONTESTED DECISION BE SUSPENDED AND PRESCRIBE ANY OTHER NECESSARY INTERIM MEASURE .   THE APPLICANT CLAIMS THAT THE COURT SHOULD MAKE AN ORDER SUSPENDING THE OPERATION OF THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION OF JANUARY WHICH IMPOSED ON IT A FINE OF ( NINE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN ) EUROPEAN CURRENCY UNITS FOR EXCEEDING THE PRODUCTION OR DELIVERY QUOTAS ALLOCATED TO IT FOR THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS OF IN RESPECT OF VARIOUS IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTS .   ALTHOUGH PROCEEDINGS WERE INSTITUTED FOR A DECLARATION THAT THAT DECISION WAS VOID , THE COMMISSION DECIDED , IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHAT IS NOW AN ESTABLISHED PRACTICE , TO ENFORCE PAYMENT OF 70% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PAYABLE , IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE APPLICANT HAD ALREADY BEEN PENALIZED FOR AN INFRINGEMENT OF GENERAL DECISION NO 1831/81/ECSC OF JUNE . THE COMMISSION CONSIDERS THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE TO ADOPT A MORE SEVERE APPROACH WITH REGARD TO SUSPENDING ENFORCEMENT OF THE PENALTY UNTIL THE COURT HAS GIVEN JUDGMENT ON ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST DECISIONS IMPOSING FINES IN CASES WHERE A PENALTY HAS ALREADY BEEN IMPOSED FOR A FIRST INFRINGEMENT .       THE APPLICANT DENIES THAT THE EXCESSES OF WHICH IT IS ACCUSED IN RESPECT OF THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS OF , EVEN IF PROVED , CONSTITUTE A SECOND INFRINGEMENT . IT POINTS OUT IN THAT CONNECTION THAT EVEN THOUGH IT HAS ALREADY BEEN SANCTIONED BY A PREVIOUS DECISION IMPOSING A FINE UPON IT FOR EXCESSES RECORDED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF , IT HAS BROUGHT AN ACTION AGAINST THAT DECISION ON WHICH THE COURT HAS NOT YET DELIVERED JUDGMENT . ACCORDING TO THE APPLICANT , AS LONG AS THE COURT HAS NOT UPHELD THAT FINE , IN WHOLE OR IN PART , IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT THE APPLICANT HAS COMMITTED A FURTHER INFRINGEMENT .   ORAL ARGUMENT IN THIS CASE WAS PRESENTED ON JUNE IN RELATION TO THE DISPUTE BEFORE THE COURT CONCERNING QUOTAS ALLEGED TO HAVE BEEN EXCEEDED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF ( CASE 78/) AND THE ADVOCATE GENERAL ' S OPINION IS LISTED TO BE DELIVERED ON OCTOBER ; JUDGMENT WILL BE DELIVERED WITHIN A FORESEEABLE PERIOD AFTER THAT DATE .   IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES , AND IN THE LIGHT OF THE STAGE OF THE PROCEDURE REACHED IN CASE 78/, IT IS APPROPRIATE TO SUSPEND THE OPERATION OF THE CONTESTED DECISION , IN ANY EVENT UNTIL THE COURT HAS DELIVERED JUDGMENT IN THAT CASE , SINCE THAT JUDGMENT MIGHT HAVE AN APPRECIABLE INFLUENCE ON THE DECISION TO BE GIVEN IN THE PRESENT DISPUTE .   IT WILL BE FOR THE PARTIES , AFTER THE COURT HAS DELIVERED JUDGMENT IN CASE 78/, CONCERNING AN APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION OF THE NULLITY OF COMMISSION DECISION NO C() 376/OF MARCH , TO DRAW THE NECESSARY CONCLUSIONS FROM THAT JUDGMENT WITH REGARD TO THE RECOVERY OF THE FINE TO WHICH THIS ORDER RELATES AND , IF APPROPRIATE , TO MAKE A FURTHER APPLICATION TO THE COURT FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES .   THE APPLICANT ALSO PROPOSES TO FURNISH ONLY A PROMISSORY NOTE AS SECURITY FOR PAYMENT OF THE FINE , A PROPOSAL THAT THE COMMISSION HAS ALREADY ACCEPTED IN RELATION TO THE SYSTEM PROVIDED FOR IN COMMISSION DECISION NO 3716/83/ECSC OF DECEMBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ).   DECISION NO 3716/83/ECSC DEALS WITH A DIFFERENT SITUATION , IN WHICH IT IS NECESSARY TO GUARANTEE THAT ANY PENALTY WHICH MIGHT BE IMPOSED CAN BE ENFORCED RAPIDLY IN THE EVENT OF NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE MINIMUM PRICES OR QUANTITIES WHICH MAY BE DELIVERED IN THE COMMON MARKET . ON THE OTHER HAND , WHERE A FINE HAS BEEN IMPOSED , THE REQUIREMENT OF A BANK GUARANTEE IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GENERAL POLICY OF THE COMMISSION , WHICH HAS BEEN     FOUND TO BE REASONABLE AND WAS RECOGNIZED AS JUSTIFIED IN THE ORDER OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF NOVEMBER ( CASE 263/R KLOCKNER-WERKE V COMMISSION ( ) ECR ).  
Operative part
