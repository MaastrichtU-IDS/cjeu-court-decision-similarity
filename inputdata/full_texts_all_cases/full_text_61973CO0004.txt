Grounds
THE COURT IS NOT CALLED UPON TO TAX THE FEES WHICH ARE OWED BY THE PARTIES TO THEIR OWN LAWYERS AND ADVISERS BUT TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE SUM REPRESENTING SUCH REMUNERATION IS RECOVERABLE AGAINST THE PARTY ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .  THE COURT CANNOT, IN CONSEQUENCE, TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE AGREEMENT REACHED BETWEEN THE INTERVENERS AND THEIR LAWYERS .  UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COURT, '... THE FOLLOWING SHALL BE REGARDED AS RECOVERABLE COSTS : ... ( B ) EXPENSES NECESSARILY INCURRED BY THE PARTIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS, IN PARTICULAR ... THE REMUNERATION OF AGENTS, ADVISERS OR LAWYERS '.  SINCE NOTHING IN THE NATURE OF A SCALE OF FEES IS PROVIDED FOR UNDER COMMUNITY LAW, THE COURT HAS DISCRETION TO MAKE ITS OWN ASSESSMENT OF THE FEATURES OF THE CASE, PAYING REGARD TO THE SUBJECT-MATTER AND NATURE OF THE ACTION, ITS IMPORTANCE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF COMMUNITY LAW, AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE CASE .

MOREOVER, AS THEY SUPPORTED THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE COMMISSION IN THE MAIN ACTION, THE INTERVENERS WERE JOINED WITH THE COMMISSION AND TO A LARGE EXTENT RELIED ON THE ARGUMENTS WHICH IT PUT FORWARD .  IN THE LIGHT OF ALL THESE CONSIDERATIONS, THE RECOVERABLE COSTS MUST BE FIXED IN THE SUM OF DM ...  ON THOSE GROUNDS,  HAVING REGARD TO ARTICLES AND OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE;  UPON HEARING THE REPORT OF THE JUDGE-RAPPORTEUR;  UPON HEARING THE OPINION OF THE ADVOCATE-GENERAL,  THE COURT  HEREBY ORDERS :  THE COSTS RECOVERABLE BY THE INTERVENERS FROM THE APPLICANT ARE FIXED IN THE SUM OF DM ...
