Summary
. AT THE PRESENT STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITY LAW , CHARACTERIZED BY ONLY PARTIAL HARMONIZATION IN THE AREA OF TAXATION , THE MEMBER STATES HAVE RETAINED EXTENSIVE POWERS IN THAT AREA , IN PARTICULAR THE POWER TO LEVY INDIRECT TAXES ON FOODSTUFFS . THE MEMBER STATES MUST NEVERTHELESS , IN EXERCISING THOSE POWERS , COMPLY WITH THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY . IN AGRICULTURAL MATTERS THE MEMBER STATES MUST , IN EXERCISING THEIR OWN FISCAL POWERS , COMPLY IN PARTICULAR WITH THE BASIC RULE THAT THEY MUST REFRAIN  FROM ADOPTING ANY MEASURE CAPABLE OF INTERFERING WITH THE FUNCTIONING OF THE MACHINERY ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMON ORGANIZATIONS OF THE MARKET .    . WHERE THE COMMUNITY RULES ONLY AUTHORIZE PAYMENT OF AN AID ON CONDITION THAT CERTAIN FORMAL EVIDENCE IS SUPPLIED ON PAYMENT , AN AID PAID WITHOUT COMPLYING WITH THAT CONDITION IS NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH COMMUNITY LAW AND THE EXPENDITURE THEREBY INCURRED CANNOT      THEREFORE BE CHARGED TO THE FUND ON THE CLEARANCE OF THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR IN QUESTION .    REGULATION NO 729/OF THE COUNCIL OF APRIL ON THE FINANCING OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY PERMITS THE COMMISSION TO CHARGE TO THE FUND ONLY SUMS PAID IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULES LAID DOWN IN THE VARIOUS SECTORS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION WHILE LEAVING THE MEMBER STATES TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF ANY  OTHER SUM . A STRICT INTERPRETATION OF THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH EXPENDITURE IS TO BE BORNE BY THE FUND IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE MANAGEMENT OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY IN CONDITIONS OF EQUALITY BETWEEN TRADERS IN THE MEMBER STATES REQUIRES THAT THE NATIONAL AUTHORITIES OF A MEMBER STATE SHOULD NOT , BY THE EXPEDIENT OF A WIDE INTERPRETATION OF A GIVEN PROVISION , FAVOUR OR TREAT UNFAVOURABLY TRADERS OF THAT STATE IN COMPARISON WITH THOSE OF OTHER MEMBER STATES .

Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT COMMISSION DECISION NO 83/OF JANUARY CONCERNING THE CLEARANCE OF THE ACCOUNTS PRESENTED BY THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC IN RESPECT OF THE EUROPEAN AGRICULTURAL GUIDANCE AND GUARANTEE FUND , GUARANTEE SECTION , EXPENDITURE FOR ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ) IS VOID IN PART , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON APRIL THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC BROUGHT AN ACTION PURSUANT TO THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT COMMISSION DECISION NO 83/OF JANUARY CONCERNING THE CLEARANCE OF THE ACCOUNTS PRESENTED BY THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC IN RESPECT OF THE EUROPEAN AGRICULTURAL GUIDANCE AND GUARANTEE FUND , GUARANTEE SECTION , EXPENDITURE FOR ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ) IS VOID IN PART .   THE APPLICATION SEEKS A DECLARATION THAT THE DECISION IS VOID IN SO FAR AS THE COMMISSION REFUSED TO CHARGE TO THE EUROPEAN AGRICULTURAL GUIDANCE AND GUARANTEE FUND ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' THE FUND ' ) IN THE FIRST PLACE A SUM OF LIT IN RESPECT OF THE PAYMENT OF AIDS FOR THE DISTILLATION OF TABLE WINE AND IN THE SECOND PLACE A SUM OF LIT IN RESPECT OF THE PAYMENT OF THE SUMS INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROMOTION OF ADVERTISING AND PUBLICITY CAMPAIGNS DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE THE CONSUMPTION OF MEAT .  THE COMMISSION ' S REFUSAL TO CHARGE TO THE FUND THE PAYMENT OF AIDS FOR THE DISTILLATION OF TABLE WINE   BY REGULATION NO 567/OF MARCH ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ) THE COUNCIL DECIDED TO UNDERTAKE A DISTILLATION OPERATION IN RESPECT OF TABLE WINE IN ORDER TO MEET THE DIFFICULTIES ON THE WINE MARKET WHERE STOCKS WERE VERY HIGH AND PRICES BELOW THE INTERVENTION PRICE . SINCE THAT MEASURE DID NOT COMPLETELY HAVE THE ANTICIPATED EFFECT THE COUNCIL CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE BY REGULATION NO 1281/OF JUNE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ) FOR A SECOND DISTILLATION OPERATION .   THE TWO AFOREMENTIONED REGULATIONS WERE ADOPTED UNDER ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 816/OF THE COUNCIL OF APRIL ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE     MARKET IN WINE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ), WHICH PERMITS DISTILLATION OPERATIONS TO BE UNDERTAKEN AND LAYS DOWN THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THEY ARE TO BE CARRIED OUT , IN PARTICULAR SO AS TO ENSURE THAT THE BALANCE OF THE MARKET IN ETHYL ALCOHOL IS NOT ADVERSELY AFFECTED .   THE SYSTEM ADOPTED IN THIS CASE WAS BASED ON THE ONE HAND ON THE CONCLUSION OF REVOCABLE DELIVERY CONTRACTS BETWEEN PRODUCERS AND DISTILLERS , AND ON THE OTHER HAND THE FIXING OF A MINIMUM BUYING-IN PRICE FOR TABLE WINES WHICH WAS IN EXCESS OF THE MARKET PRICE AND WHICH DISTILLERS WERE REQUIRED TO PAY TO PRODUCERS . THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST OF THE ALCOHOL THEREBY PRODUCED AND THE SELLING PRICE OF THE SAME ALCOHOL UNDER NORMAL MARKETING CONDITIONS WAS MADE UP BY AN AID PAID BY THE INTERVENTION AGENCY AND CHARGEABLE TO THE GUARANTEE SECTION OF THE FUND . THE AID WAS FIXED AT A LEVEL WHICH MADE IT POSSIBLE TO MARKET THE PRODUCTS OF DISTILLATION .   THE COMMISSION REFUSED TO CHARGE TO THE FUND THE SUMS PAID OUT IN RESPECT OF OPERATIONS EFFECTED BY THE AZIENDA DI STATO PER GLI INTERVENTI SUL MERCATO AGRICOLO ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' THE ITALIAN INTERVENTION AGENCY ' ) ON THREE GROUNDS : THE FIRST GROUND WAS THAT ITALY HAD ADOPTED A FISCAL MEASURE AMOUNTING TO AN INDIRECT AID IN ADDITION TO THE COMMUNITY AID ; THE SECOND GROUND RELATES TO THE FACT THAT , CONTRARY TO ARTICLES ( ) AND ( ) OF REGULATION NO 567/, THE ITALIAN INTERVENTION AGENCY PAID A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE AIDS TO PRODUCERS WHO HAD ONLY DELIVERED PART OF THE WINE CONTRACTED TO BE DELIVERED ; AND THE THIRD GROUND RELATES TO THE FACT THAT , CONTRARY TO ARTICLE ( ) AND ( ) OF REGULATION NO 567/, THE ITALIAN INTERVENTION AGENCY PAID THE AID IN A SINGLE PAYMENT AND NOT IN TWO INSTALMENTS .  THE PRINCIPAL GROUND : THE ALLEGED ADOPTION BY ITALY OF A FISCAL MEASURE AMOUNTING TO AN INDIRECT AID IN ADDITION TO THE COMMUNITY AID AND CAPABLE OF AFFECTING THE APPLICATION OF COMMUNITY AID FOR DISTILLATION   IT IS COMMON GROUND THAT THREE DAYS AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF REGULATION NO 567/ITALY ADOPTED DECRETO-LEGGE ( DECREE-LAW ) NO OF MARCH CONCERNING URGENT FISCAL MEASURES ( SUBSEQUENTLY BECOMING LEGGE ( LAW ) NO OF MAY ), WHICH PROVIDED , INTER ALIA , FOR THE IMPOSITION OF AN INCREASED DUTY ON ALCOHOL MADE FROM MOLASSES . THE EFFECT OF THAT FISCAL MEASURE WAS TO INVERT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MOLASSES-BASED ALCOHOL AND WINE-BASED ALCOHOL WITH THE PRICE     OF THE FORMER RISING FROM LIT PER HECTOLITRE TO LIT PER HECTOLITRE AND THE PRICE OF THE LATTER RISING FROM LIT PER HECTOLITRE TO LIT PER HECTOLITRE .   THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT ' S MAIN CONTENTION IS THAT THE FISCAL MEASURE IN QUESTION FALLS WITHIN ITS SOLE COMPETENCE AND THAT THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THAT MEASURE WAS TO INCREASE INCOME FROM TAXATION AND , IN ORDER TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION , MERELY TO BRING THE TAX ON MOLASSES-BASED ALCOHOL , WHICH HAD REMAINED UNCHANGED SINCE , UP TO DATE . IT ALSO CONTENDS THAT THE MEASURE APPLIED TO ALCOHOLS IN GENERAL AND DID NOT GIVE FAVOURABLE TREATMENT TO WINE-BASED ALCOHOL IN PARTICULAR . FINALLY , IT CONTENDS THAT THE MEASURE DID NOT INVOLVE THE GRANT OF ADDITIONAL , UNLAWFUL BENEFITS TO ITALIAN DISTILLERS .   THE COMMISSION MAINTAINS , CONVERSELY , THAT THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT WAS INDEED RESPONSIBLE FOR A ' FISCAL CONTRIVANCE '  WHEREBY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PRICES OF DIFFERENT ALCOHOLS WAS SUDDENLY INVERTED FOR THE BENEFIT OF WINE-BASED ALCOHOL AND THAT THE PURPOSE OR EFFECT OF THAT STEP WAS TO INCREASE THE ' PERMITTED PROFIT MARGIN '  OF WINE DISTILLERS SO THAT THE LATTER WERE ABLE TO PASS ON ALL OR PART OF THAT ADDITIONAL MARGIN TO THE WINE GROWERS . IN FACT THE ITALIAN DISTILLERS OF WINE-BASED ALCOHOL WERE ABLE , BY MEANS OF THAT NATIONAL MEASURE , TO PAY WINE PRODUCERS A PRICE ABOVE THE MINIMUM PRICE , TO TAKE OVER A LARGER SHARE OF THE MARKET TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE PRODUCERS OF MOLASSES-BASED ALCOHOL AND TO BENEFIT FROM LARGER PROFIT MARGINS THAN THOSE WHICH THEY WOULD HAVE OBTAINED ON THE OPEN MARKET WITH ONLY COMMUNITY AID AS A CORRECTIVE MEASURE . IN ANY EVENT THE PRODUCERS '  TOTAL PROFIT WAS HIGHER SINCE THEY DELIVERED LARGER QUANTITIES OF WINE FOR DISTILLATION .   THUS , ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSION , THE MEASURE IN QUESTION WAS A UNILATERAL MEASURE WHICH WAS ADOPTED IN AN AREA COMING UNDER A COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET , WHICH WAS ADDITIONAL TO THE COMMUNITY MEASURE AND WHICH WAS CAPABLE OF AFFECTING THE PROCESS OF PRICE FORMATION , OF JEOPARDIZING THE EQUAL TREATMENT OF ECONOMIC OPERATORS AND OF ALTERING THE CONDITIONS OF COMPETITION . ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSION , WHEN COMMUNITY MEASURES FOR THE DISTILLATION OF TABLE WINES WERE BEING IMPLEMENTED ONLY THE COMMUNITY HAD THE POWER TO ENSURE OR ALTER THE BALANCE OF THE MARKET IN ETHYL ALCOHOL .   IT MUST BE OBSERVED THAT AT THE PRESENT STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITY LAW , CHARACTERIZED BY ONLY PARTIAL HARMONIZATION IN THIS AREA , THE MEMBER STATES HAVE     RETAINED EXTENSIVE FISCAL POWERS , IN PARTICULAR THE POWER TO LEVY INDIRECT TAXES ON FOODSTUFFS . THE MEMBER STATES MUST NEVERTHELESS , IN EXERCISING THOSE POWERS , COMPLY WITH THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY . IN AGRICULTURAL MATTERS THE MEMBER STATES MUST , IN EXERCISING THEIR OWN FISCAL POWERS , COMPLY IN PARTICULAR WITH THE BASIC RULE THAT THEY MUST REFRAIN FROM ADOPTING ANY MEASURE CAPABLE OF INTERFERING WITH THE FUNCTIONING OF THE MACHINERY ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMON ORGANIZATIONS OF THE MARKET .   ACCORDINGLY , AS THE COURT POINTED OUT IN ITS JUDGMENTS OF NOVEMBER ( CASE 83/, PIGS MARKETING BOARD V REDMOND , ( ) ECR ) AND OF JUNE ( CASE 177/, PIGS AND BACON COMMISSION V MCCARREN , ( ) ECR ), ONCE THE COMMUNITY HAS , PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE TREATY , LEGISLATED FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN A GIVEN SECTOR , MEMBER STATES ARE UNDER AN OBLIGATION TO REFRAIN FROM TAKING ANY MEASURE WHICH MIGHT UNDERMINE OR CREATE EXCEPTIONS TO IT . THE COURT HAS ALSO STATED IN ITS JUDGMENT OF MARCH ( JOINED CASES AND 71/, IRISH CREAMERY MILK SUPPLIERS ASSOCIATION V GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND , ( ) ECR THAT THE ESSENTIAL AIM OF THE MACHINERY OF THE COMMON ORGANIZATIONS IN QUESTION IS TO ACHIEVE PRICE LEVELS AT THE PRODUCTION AND WHOLESALE STAGES WHICH TAKE INTO ACCOUNT BOTH THE INTERESTS OF COMMUNITY PRODUCTION AS A WHOLE IN THE RELEVANT SECTOR AND THOSE OF THE CONSUMERS , AND WHICH GUARANTEE MARKET SUPPLIES WITHOUT ENCOURAGING OVER-PRODUCTION . THOSE AIMS MIGHT BE JEOPARDIZED BY NATIONAL MEASURES ADOPTED UNILATERALLY , WHICH HAVE AN APPRECIABLE INFLUENCE , EVEN IF UNINTENTIONALLY , ON PRICE LEVELS ON THE MARKET .   HOWEVER , IN THIS CASE , IT MUST BE OBSERVED THAT THE CONTESTED FISCAL MEASURE IS ONE OF A SERIES OF FISCAL MEASURES INTENDED TO INCREASE STATE REVENUES AND THAT IT IS COMMON GROUND THAT IT UPDATED THE TAX ON MOLASSES-BASED ALCOHOL WHICH HAD REMAINED UNCHANGED FOR YEARS DESPITE THE FALL IN THE VALUE OF MONEY . FURTHERMORE THE TAX IS NOT LEVIED ON ALCOHOL PRODUCED BY THE DISTILLATION OF WINE WHICH IS COVERED BY THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN WINE , WHICH ALONE IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS CASE , BUT NOT MOLASSES-BASED ALCOHOL .   IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES , IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY THE CONCLUSION THAT THE TAX INCREASE IN QUESTION ENABLED THE AMOUNT OF WINE DELIVERED FOR DISTILLATION TO INCREASE , IT MUST BE ESTABLISHED IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT THE WINE DISTILLERS WERE ABLE TO INCREASE ' THEIR PERMITTED PROFIT MARGINS '  BY INCREASING THEIR SELLING PRICE TO THE LEVEL ATTAINED BY     MOLASSES-BASED ALCOHOL AND IN THE SECOND PLACE THAT THEY DID IN FACT PASS ON AT LEAST PART OF THAT ADDITIONAL BENEFIT TO THE WINE PRODUCERS BY AN APPROPRIATE INCREASE IN THE BUYING-IN PRICE OF WINES DELIVERED FOR DISTILLATION .   IT HAS TO BE STATED THAT NEITHER IN THE DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE ON THE CASE NOR IN THE ARGUMENTS PRESENTED BEFORE THE COURT HAS ANY STATISTICAL EVIDENCE BEEN ADDUCED TO SHOW THAT THAT HAD IN FACT BEEN THE CASE . IN PARTICULAR IT HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN THAT DISTILLERS DID IN FACT OFFER WINE PRODUCERS MORE FAVOURABLE PRICES , THEREBY ENCOURAGING THE LATTER TO DELIVER GREATER QUANTITIES OF WINE FOR DISTILLATION .   IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WITHOUT THE NEED TO INQUIRE WHETHER THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CONTESTED FISCAL MEASURE WAS OTHER THAN TO INCREASE REVENUE FROM THE TAX IN QUESTION IT MUST BE FOUND THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE IN ANY OF THE DOCUMENTS AS SUBMITTED TO THE COURT THAT THAT MEASURE AFFECTED THE MARKET PRICE FOR WINE-BASED ALCOHOL AND WAS CAPABLE OF JEOPARDIZING THE AIMS AND FUNCTIONING OF THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN WINE . ACCORDINGLY THE FIRST GROUND RELIED UPON BY THE COMMISSION FOR REFUSING TO CHARGE TO THE FUND THE EXPENDITURE INCURRED BY THE ITALIAN INTERVENTION AGENCY IN RESPECT OF AIDS FOR THE DISTILLATION OF TABLE WINES , CANNOT BE ACCEPTED .  THE SUBSIDIARY GROUND THAT , CONTRARY TO REGULATION NO 567/, THE ITALIAN INTERVENTION AGENCY PAID A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE AIDS TO PRODUCERS IN RESPECT OF DISTILLATION CONTRACTS WHICH HAD NOT BEEN ENTIRELY PERFORMED   ACCORDING TO ARTICLES AND OF REGULATION NO 567/THE INTERVENTION ORGANIZATION IS TO PAY THE AID TO PRODUCERS IN TWO PARTS : THE FIRST PART , IN THE FORM OF AN ADVANCE , IS TO BE PAID WITHIN DAYS OF APPROVAL OF THE CONTRACT AND THE SECOND PART , WHICH IS THE BALANCE OF THE AID , IS TO BE PAID , ACCORDING TO ARTICLE ( ), ' WHEN PROOF HAS BEEN FURNISHED THAT THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE WINE INDICATED IN THE CONTRACT HAS BEEN DISTILLED . '   THE COMMISSION ALLEGES THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC AND ITS INTERVENTION AGENCY PAID AID WITHOUT PROOF THAT THE TOTAL QUANTITY OF WINE INDICATED IN THE CONTRACT HAD BEEN DISTILLED .       THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS PRIMARILY THAT UNDER ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 567/CONTRACTS FOR THE DELIVERY OF TABLE WINE ARE REVOCABLE AND THAT THE COMMUNITY LEGISLATURE DID NOT INTEND TO RESTRICT THE AUTONOMY OF THE CONTRACTING PARTIES BUT ONLY TO LAY DOWN THE METHOD OF PAYMENT OF THE BALANCE OF THE AID BY SUBJECTING SUCH PAYMENT TO PROOF THAT THE TOTAL QUANTITY OF WINE DELIVERED UNDER THE CONTRACT WAS ACTUALLY DISTILLED . IN VIEW OF THE PURPOSE OF THE AID WHICH WAS TO RESTORE THE BALANCE OF THE MARKET , THE COMMISSION ' S ARGUMENT IS BASED ON A MISINTERPRETATION OF THE PROVISIONS IN QUESTION WHICH LEADS TO DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN THOSE PRODUCERS WHO PARTIALLY PERFORMED THE DISTILLATION CONTRACTS AND THOSE WHO DID NOT PERFORM THEM AT ALL .   IN THE ALTERNATIVE THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS THAT THE EXPENDITURE INCURRED IN RESPECT OF CONTRACTS WHICH WERE FULLY PERFORMED SHOULD STILL BE CHARGED TO THE FUND .   IT MUST BE POINTED OUT THAT , AS THE COURT HELD IN ITS JUDGMENT OF FEBRUARY ( JOINED CASES AND 16/, FRENCH GOVERNMENT V COMMISSION , ( ) ECR ), WHERE THE COMMUNITY RULES ONLY AUTHORIZE PAYMENT OF AN AID ON CONDITION THAT CERTAIN FORMAL EVIDENCE IS SUPPLIED ON PAYMENT , AN AID PAID WITHOUT COMPLYING WITH THAT CONDITION IS NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH COMMUNITY LAW AND THE EXPENDITURE THEREBY INCURRED CANNOT THEREFORE BE CHARGED TO THE FUND ON THE CLEARANCE OF THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR IN QUESTION .   THE COMMISSION RIGHTLY OBSERVES THAT THE INTERPRETATION PROPOSED BY THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT IS CONTRARY TO THE WORDING OF THE AFOREMENTIONED ARTICLE ( ) WHICH REQUIRES , AS A PRECONDITION FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE AID , THAT THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE WINE INDICATED IN THE CONTRACT HAS BEEN DISTILLED .   FURTHERMORE , ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT CONTRACTS FOR THE DELIVERY OF TABLE WINE FOR DISTILLATION ARE DESCRIBED AS REVOCABLE IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 567/, CONDITIONS RELATING TO THE TIME WITHIN WHICH THE RIGHT TO REVOKE MUST BE EXERCISED AND WITH REGARD TO THE SUBSTANCE OF THAT RIGHT WERE LAID DOWN IN ARTICLES AND OF REGULATION NO 567/AND BY ARTICLE OF COMMISSION REGULATION NO 588/OF MARCH ON DETAILED RULES FOR THE DISTILLATION OF TABLE WINES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ). THOSE PROVISIONS ONLY PERMIT THE EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT TO REVOKE SUCH A DISTILLATION CONTRACT WITHIN THE PERIOD LAID DOWN WHERE THE SITUATION     ON THE MARKET ENABLES THE PRODUCER TO OBTAIN A BETTER PRICE FOR THE WINE . THOSE PROVISIONS THEREFORE NEITHER HAVE THE OBJECT NOR THE EFFECT OF SETTING ASIDE THE REQUIREMENT LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 567/THAT THE PAYMENT OF THE BALANCE OF THE AID IS SUBJECT TO PROOF THAT THE CONTRACT HAS BEEN ENTIRELY PERFORMED . IN THAT RESPECT THEREFORE THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT ' S ARGUMENTS MUST BE REJECTED .   HOWEVER , AS THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT MAINTAINED AND AS WAS ACCEPTED BY THE COMMISSION ITSELF , THE EXPENDITURE INCURRED IN RESPECT OF CONTRACTS THE FULL PERFORMANCE OF WHICH CAN BE PROVED BY THE INTERVENTION AGENCY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 567/, SHOULD BE CHARGED TO THE FUND . THE COMMISSION HAS , MOREOVER , STATED THAT IT IS WILLING TO CARRY OUT WITH THE ITALIAN AUTHORITIES A CHECK OF THE ACCOUNTS RELATING TO THE VARIOUS OPERATIONS AFTER THE DELIVERY OF THIS JUDGMENT .   IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY FOR THE COURT TO DECLARE THAT ONLY THE EXPENDITURE WHICH HAS BEEN INCURRED PROPERLY UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 567/SHOULD BE CHARGED TO THE FUND . IT FOLLOWS THAT THE PARTIES MUST EXAMINE THE ACCOUNTS TOGETHER IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHICH SUMS SHOULD ACTUALLY BE CHARGED TO THE FUND ON THAT BASIS .  THE SUBSIDIARY GROUND THAT , CONTRARY TO ARTICLE ( ) AND ( ) OF REGULATION NO 567/, THE ITALIAN INTERVENTION AGENCY PAID THE AID IN A SINGLE SUM AND NOT IN TWO INSTALMENTS   AS HAS ALREADY BEEN STATED , UNDER ARTICLES ( ) AND ( ) AND ( ) OF REGULATION NO 567/THE INTERVENTION AGENCY IS TO PAY THE AID TO PRODUCERS IN TWO INSTALMENTS , NAMELY AN ADVANCE WITHIN DAYS OF APPROVAL OF THE CONTRACT AND THE BALANCE WHEN PROOF HAS BEEN FURNISHED THAT THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE WINE INDICATED IN THE CONTRACT HAS BEEN DISTILLED . THE REASON FOR THOSE PROVISIONS , AS IS CLEAR FROM THE SEVENTH RECITAL IN THE PREAMBLE TO REGULATION NO 567/, IS THE NEED TO PROVIDE FOR A MECHANISM TO ENABLE PART OF THE PURCHASE PRICE TO BE PAID IMMEDIATELY TO ENCOURAGE PRODUCERS WHO WISH TO HAVE THEIR WINE DISTILLED TO TAKE A DECISION .   IT SHOULD BE OBSERVED , AS A PRELIMINARY POINT , THAT THIS SUBSIDIARY REASON FOR REFUSING TO CHARGE SUMS TO THE FUND PUT FORWARD BY THE COMMISSION CAN ONLY     RELATE TO DISTILLATION CARRIED OUT UNDER REGULATION NO 567/SINCE , ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF COUNCIL REGULATION NO 1281/, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SECOND DISTILLATION OPERATION , THE MINIMUM BUYING-IN PRICE MAY BE PAID BY THE INTERVENTION AGENCY IN A SINGLE PAYMENT AFTER DISTILLATION OF THE TOTAL QUANTITY OF WINE INDICATED IN THE CONTRACT .   THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS ACCEPTED THAT IN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CASES ITS INTERVENTION AGENCY PAID AID IN A SINGLE SUM AND NOT IN TWO INSTALMENTS AS IS LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 567/. NEVERTHELESS IT STATED THAT IT HAD ONLY HAD RECOURSE TO THAT PRACTICE IN A LIMITED NUMBER OF CASES AND FOR REASONS OF EXPEDIENCY , THAT IS TO SAY , WHERE IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO MAKE THE PAYMENT ON ACCOUNT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD AND WHERE THE CONDITIONS FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE WHOLE OF THE AID IN A SINGLE SUM WERE FULFILLED . CONSEQUENTLY THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT CONCLUDES PRIMARILY THAT , IN VIEW OF THE PURPOSE OF THE AID , SUCH A FORMAL REQUIREMENT IS OF LITTLE IMPORTANCE AND IN THE ALTERNATIVE THAT THAT PART OF THE EXPENDITURE TO WHICH THE COMMISSION ' S ARGUMENT DOES NOT RELATE SHOULD , IN ANY EVENT , BE CHARGED TO THE FUND .   THE COMMISSION MAINTAINS , ON THE CONTRARY , THAT THE PRACTICE WAS IN FACT FOLLOWED GENERALLY AND THAT THE FAILURE TO MAKE AN ADVANCE PAYMENT TO PRODUCERS CONSTITUTED A SERIOUS FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE RULES FOR UNDERTAKING THE DISTILLATION OPERATION IN VIEW , IN PARTICULAR , OF THE DISCOURAGING EFFECT OF SUCH FAILURE , AN EFFECT WHICH , MOREOVER , WAS INTENSIFIED BY THE DELAYS IN PAYMENT .   NEVERTHELESS THE , COMMISSION ACCEPTED AT THE HEARING THAT THAT SUBSIDIARY GROUND COULD NOT RESULT IN A REFUSAL TO CHARGE TO THE FUND ALL THE DISTILLATION AIDS GRANTED UNDER REGULATION NO 567/BUT ONLY THE EXPENDITURE INCURRED IN RESPECT OF AIDS WHERE THE AMOUNT TO BE PAID UNDER THE CONTRACT WAS PAID IN A SINGLE PAYMENT .   AS THE COURT HELD IN ITS JUDGMENT OF FEBRUARY ( CASE 11/, GOVERNMENT OF THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS V COMMISSION , ( ) ECR ) ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 729/OF THE COUNCIL OF APRIL ON THE FINANCING OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . )     PERMITS THE COMMISSION TO CHARGE TO THE FUND ONLY SUMS PAID IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULES LAID DOWN IN THE VARIOUS SECTORS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION WHILE LEAVING THE MEMBER STATES TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF ANY OTHER SUM PAID . MOREOVER , THE COURT ADDED THAT A STRICT INTERPRETATION OF THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH EXPENDITURE IS TO BE BORNE BY THE FUND IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE MANAGEMENT OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY IN CONDITIONS OF EQUALITY BETWEEN TRADERS IN THE MEMBER STATES REQUIRES THAT THE NATIONAL AUTHORITIES OF A MEMBER STATE SHOULD NOT , BY THE EXPEDIENT OF A WIDE INTERPRETATION OF A GIVEN PROVISION , FAVOUR OR TREAT UNFAVOURABLY TRADERS OF THAT STATE IN COMPARISON WITH THOSE OF OTHER MEMBER STATES .   ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 567/REQUIRES THE MEMBER STATES TO PAY THE AIDS NOT BY MEANS OF A SINGLE PAYMENT BUT BY MEANS , INITIALLY , OF AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT ON ACCOUNT INTENDED TO ASSIST PRODUCERS WHO WISH TO HAVE THEIR WINE DISTILLED TO TAKE A DECISION , AND , SECONDLY , A PAYMENT OF THE BALANCE AFTER PROOF HAS BEEN FURNISHED THAT THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE WINE INDICATED IN THE CONTRACT HAS IN FACT BEEN DISTILLED .   ACCORDINGLY THE COMMISSION WAS QUITE RIGHT IN ITS CONTENTION THAT THE SUM REPRESENTING THE AIDS WHERE THE AMOUNT TO BE PAID UNDER THE CONTRACT WAS PAID IN A SINGLE PAYMENT AND NOT IN TWO INSTALMENTS AS REQUIRED BY REGULATION NO 567/SHOULD NOT BE CHARGED TO THE FUND AND SHOULD BE BORNE BY THE MEMBER STATE IN QUESTION . HOWEVER , THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT IS JUSTIFIED IN REQUESTING THAT THE EXPENDITURE INCURRED IN RESPECT OF AIDS WHERE THE AMOUNT TO BE PAID UNDER THE CONTRACT WAS PAID IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATIONS NOS 567/AND 1281/SHOULD BE CHARGED TO THE FUND . IT THEREFORE FOLLOWS THAT THE PARTIES WILL HAVE TO EXAMINE THE ACCOUNTS TOGETHER IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHICH SUMS SHOULD ACTUALLY BE CHARGED TO THE FUND ON THAT BASIS .  THE COMMISSION ' S REFUSAL TO CHARGE TO THE FUND THE EXPENDITURE INCURRED IN RESPECT OF AN ADVERTISING AND PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN DESIGNED TO PROMOTE THE CONSUMPTION OF MEAT   UNDER ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1857/OF THE COUNCIL OF JULY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ) TOGETHER WITH ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 2930/OF THE COUNCIL OF NOVEMBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ) THE MEMBER STATES WERE AUTHORIZED , DURING THE PERIOD PRIOR TO JULY , TO PROMOTE ADVERTISING AND PUBLICITY CAMPAIGNS CONCERNED WITH MEAT AND DESIGNED TO BRING THE CUSTOMERS '  CHOICE INTO LINE WITH THE MARKET . THE FUND ' S GUARANTEE SECTION WAS TO REIMBURSE UP TO 50% OF THE EXPENDITURE THEREBY INCURRED .       IT IS COMMON GROUND THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC ORGANIZED ITS PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN AFTER JULY . ON ACCOUNT OF THAT DELAY THE COMMISSION REFUSED TO CHARGE THE EXPENDITURE THEREBY INCURRED TO THE FUND .   THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT MAINTAINED THAT IT HAD INCORRECTLY INTERPRETED THE WORD ' PROMOTE '  WHICH IT HAD UNDERSTOOD AS MEANING NOT ' ORGANIZE '  BUT ' PREPARE ALL THE NECESSARY MEASURES AND PROCEDURES FOR THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CAMPAIGNS ' ; IN THAT RESPECT IT STATED THAT ALL THE PREPARATORY MEASURES HAD IN FACT BEEN ADOPTED BEFORE JULY .    THE COMMISSION RIGHTLY CONSIDERS THAT , IN THE LIGHT OF THE WORDING OF THE PROVISIONS , THE LOGIC OF THE SYSTEM AND THE ECONOMIC NATURE OF THE MEASURE , NO ERROR OF INTERPRETATION WAS POSSIBLE AND THAT THE PUBLICITY CAMPAIGNS IN QUESTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETED BY JULY AT THE LATEST . IT FOLLOWS FROM THE WORDING OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 2930/, WHICH PROVIDES THAT THE MEMBER STATES MAY , DURING THE PERIOD TO JULY , PROMOTE ADVERTISING AND PUBLICITY CAMPAIGNS , AND FROM THE SECOND RECITAL TO THE PREAMBLE TO THAT REGULATION , WHICH PROVIDES THAT SUCH CAMPAIGNS ARE TO FINISH ON THE SAME DATE AS THAT LAID DOWN FOR BEEF AND VEAL , THAT THE DATE OF JULY WAS , WITHOUT ANY POSSIBLE AMBIGUITY , THE DATE BY WHICH THE PUBLICITY CAMPAIGNS HAD TO BE TERMINATED AND NOT THAT BY WHICH THE MEASURES PREPARATORY TO SUCH CAMPAIGNS HAD TO BE TERMINATED .   IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THE EXPENDITURE INCURRED IN RESPECT OF THOSE PUBLICITY CAMPAIGNS CANNOT BE CHARGED TO THE FUND AND ON THIS POINT THE APPLICATION MUST BE DISMISSED .   IT FOLLOWS FROM THE WHOLE OF THE FOREGOING THAT COMMISSION DECISION NO 83/OF JANUARY MUST BE DECLARED VOID IN SO FAR AS IT REFUSES TO CHARGE TO THE FUND THE PAYMENT OF AIDS FOR THE DISTILLATION OF TABLE WINE TO ITALIAN PRODUCERS UNDER DISTILLATION CONTRACTS WHICH HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY PERFORMED AND IN RESPECT OF WHICH A FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT HAS BEEN MADE IN ACCORDANCE , FIRST , WITH THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 567/AND SECONDLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1281/. THE REMAINDER OF THE ACTION MUST BE DISMISSED .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE PROVIDES THAT THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS . HOWEVER , UNDER THE FIRST SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ), WHERE EACH PARTY SUCCEEDS ON SOME AND FAILS ON OTHER HEADS THE COURT MAY ORDER THAT THE PARTIES BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS IN WHOLE OR IN PART .   SINCE EACH PARTY HAS SUCCEEDED ON SOME AND FAILED ON OTHER HEADS , EACH PARTY MUST BEAR ITS OWN COSTS .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT  HEREBY :    ( ) DECLARES THAT COMMISSION DECISION NO 83/OF JANUARY IS VOID IN SO FAR AS IT REFUSES TO CHARGE TO THE FUND THE PAYMENT OF AIDS FOR THE DISTILLATION OF TABLE WINE TO ITALIAN PRODUCERS UNDER DISTILLATION CONTRACTS WHICH HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY PERFORMED AND IN RESPECT OF WHICH A FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT HAS BEEN MADE IN ACCORDANCE , FIRST , WITH THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 567/AND SECONDLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1281/.    ( ) DISMISSES THE REMAINDER OF THE APPLICATION .   ( ) ORDERS EACH PARTY TO BEAR ITS OWN COSTS .
