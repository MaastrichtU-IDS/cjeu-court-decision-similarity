THE FACT THAT A MEMBER STATE CHARGED WITH HAVING FAILED TO FULFIL AN OBLIGATION IMPOSED ON IT BY A DIRECTIVE HAS REQUESTED AN AMENDMENT OF THAT DIRECTIVE AND THAT THE COMMISSION HAS SENT TO THE COUNCIL A PROPOSAL TO THAT EFFECT BEFORE THE ADOPTION OF THAT PROPOSAL BY THE COUNCIL CANNOT EXPUNGE THE FAILURE IN QUESTION .

HEIM  HAVING REGARD TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING AND FURTHER TO THE HEARING ON NOVEMBER 1985,  AFTER HEARING THE OPINION OF THE ADVOCATE GENERAL DELIVERED AT THE SITTING ON THE SAME DAY,  GIVES THE FOLLOWING  JUDGMENT  
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON DECEMBER 1984, THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES HAS BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT, BY NOT ADOPTING WITHIN THE TIME PRESCRIBED ALL THE PROVISIONS NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 75/OF JUNE 1975, CONCERNING THE MUTUAL RECOGNITION OF DIPLOMAS, CERTIFICATES AND OTHER EVIDENCE OF FORMAL QUALIFICATIONS IN MEDICINE, INCLUDING MEASURES TO FACILITATE THE EFFECTIVE EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT OF ESTABLISHMENT AND FREEDOM TO PROVIDE SERVICES, AND COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 75/OF JUNE 1975, CONCERNING THE COORDINATION OF PROVISIONS LAID DOWN BY LAW, REGULATION OR ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION IN RESPECT OF ACTIVITIES OF DOCTORS, THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY .  DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COURT THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT HAS ADOPTED THE MEASURES NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE TRANSPOSITION OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 75/INTO ITS NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM BY MEANS OF THREE ROYAL DECREES OF DECEMBER 1985, A MINISTERIAL DECREE OF DECEMBER AND A NOTICE ( MONITEUR BELGE OF JANUARY ). AS A RESULT OF THOSE MEASURES, THE COMMISSION INFORMED THE COURT BY A LETTER DATED FEBRUARY THAT IT WISHED TO DISCONTINUE THE ACTION IN SO FAR AS ITS OBJECT WAS TO OBTAIN A DECLARATION OF THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM' S FAILURE TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER DIRECTIVE NO 75/AND TO PROCEED WITH IT ONLY IN SO FAR AS IT RELATES TO DIRECTIVE NO 75/.  IT SHOULD BE RECALLED THAT, IN ORDER TO BRING ABOUT THE CONDITIONS REQUIRED FOR THE MUTUAL RECOGNITION OF DIPLOMAS, CERTIFICATES AND OTHER EVIDENCE OF FORMAL QUALIFICATIONS IN MEDICINE IN ACCORDANCE WITH DIRECTIVE NO 75/362, DIRECTIVE NO 75/363, AS ITS TITLE INDICATES, PROVIDES FOR THE COORDINATION OF PROVISIONS LAID DOWN BY LAW, REGULATION OR ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION IN RESPECT OF THE ACTIVITIES OF DOCTORS . ARTICLE OF DIRECTIVE NO 75/PROVIDES FOR A MINIMUM PERIOD OF SPECIALIZED TRAINING IN TROPICAL MEDICINE OF FOUR YEARS .  ARTICLE OF DIRECTIVE NO 75/LIMITS THE MUTUAL RECOGNITION OF SPECIALIZED TRAINING IN TROPICAL MEDICINE TO CERTAIN MEMBER STATES INCLUDING BELGIUM . IN ORDER TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF ARTICLE OF DIRECTIVE NO 75/363, THE COMPETENT BELGIAN AUTHORITIES WERE THEREFORE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FOR A PERIOD OF TRAINING IN THAT SPECIALTY OF AT LEAST FOUR YEARS .  IT IS COMMON GROUND THAT THE PERIOD OF SPECIALIZED TRAINING IN TROPICAL MEDICINE IN BELGIUM IS ONE YEAR . IN ORDER TO BE DISPENSED FROM THE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE FOR A FOUR-YEAR TRAINING IN TROPICAL MEDICINE, THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT REQUESTED, DURING THE WRITTEN PROCEDURE BEFORE THE COURT, THAT BELGIUM SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE LIST CONTAINED IN ARTICLE OF DIRECTIVE NO 75/. ACCORDING TO THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT THAT REQUEST TO THE COMMISSION PUT AN END TO THE INFRINGEMENT .  THE COMMISSION TAKES THE VIEW THAT A MERE REQUEST ON THE PART OF THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAVE THE EFFECT OF TERMINATING THE INFRINGEMENT RESULTING FROM ITS FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT ARTICLE OF DIRECTIVE NO 75/WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD . ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSION, IT HAS INITIATED THE PROCEDURE FOR AMENDING THAT DIRECTIVE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT' S REQUEST, BUT THE FINAL DECISION ON THAT POINT RESTS WITH THE COUNCIL . CONSEQUENTLY THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM IS STILL BOUND BY THE OBLIGATION LAID DOWN BY ARTICLE OF THAT DIRECTIVE AND HAS NOT COMPLIED WITH IT .  THE COMMISSION' S ARGUMENT MUST BE ACCEPTED . THE COMMISSION' S PROPOSAL FOR AN AMENDMENT TO THE DIRECTIVE FOLLOWING THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT' S REQUEST CANNOT EXPUNGE THE FAILURE TO FULFIL OBLIGATIONS WITH WHICH IT CHARGES THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM AND WHICH WILL SUBSIST AS LONG AS THE COUNCIL HAS NOT ADOPTED THAT PROPOSAL .  IT MUST THEREFORE BE DECLARED THAT, BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE TIME PRESCRIBED THE PROVISIONS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH DIRECTIVE NO 75/CONCERNING THE COORDINATION OF PROVISIONS LAID DOWN BY LAW, REGULATION OR ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION IN RESPECT OF ACTIVITIES OF DOCTORS, THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE COMBINED PROVISIONS OF THE EEC TREATY AND THE AFORESAID DIRECTIVE .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  UNDER THE TERMS OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .  BY VIRTUE OF ARTICLE ( ), A PARTY WHO DISCONTINUES OR WITHDRAWS FROM PROCEEDINGS IS TO BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS UNLESS THE DISCONTINUANCE OR WITHDRAWAL IS JUSTIFIED BY THE CONDUCT OF THE OPPOSITE PARTY .  THE COMMISSION HAS ABANDONED CERTAIN CLAIMS IN ITS APPLICATION AS A RESULT OF THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT' S HAVING TAKEN THE REQUIRED ACTION ON THOSE POINTS AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF THESE PROCEEDINGS .  HENCE THE COMMISSION' S PARTIAL DISCONTINUANCE OF THE PROCEEDINGS IS JUSTIFIED BY THE CONDUCT OF THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM . MOREOVER, THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM HAS FAILED IN THE REMAINDER OF ITS SUBMISSIONS .  THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM MUST THEREFORE BE ORDERED TO BEAR THE COSTS .  
Operative part
