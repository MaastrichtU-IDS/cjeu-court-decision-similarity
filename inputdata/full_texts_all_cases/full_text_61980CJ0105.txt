Subject of the case
ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATUS OF A PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES AND THAT OF A MEMBER OF THE LOCAL STAFF WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLES , , AND OF THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OTHER SERVANTS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , 
Grounds
BY JUDGMENT OF MARCH , WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON MARCH , THE TRIBUNAL DU TRAVAIL ( LABOUR COURT ), BRUSSELS , REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY A QUESTION WHICH SEEKS TO ASCERTAIN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' ' THE STAFF REGULATIONS ' ' ) AND , MORE PARTICULARLY , ARTICLE THEREOF , AND THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OTHER SERVANTS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' ' THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT ' ' ) AND , MORE PARTICULARLY , ARTICLES TO THEREOF ( CODIFIED TEXT , WHICH IS NOT AUTHENTIC , PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF SEPTEMBER , C ).   THIS QUESTION WAS SUBMITTED IN CONNEXION WITH AN ACTION PENDING BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL DU TRAVAIL BETWEEN THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES AND A FORMER MEMBER OF THE LOCAL STAFF WHO WAS APPOINTED AS A PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL AND DISMISSED AT THE END OF HIS PROBATIONARY PERIOD .   IT IS APPARENT FROM THE FILE ON THE CASE , INCLUDING THE PERSONAL FILE OF THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION , THAT HE WAS ENGAGED BY THE COMMISSION AS A MEMBER OF THE LOCAL STAFF IN BRUSSELS ON AUGUST , INITIALLY FOR A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS . UPON THE EXPIRY OF THAT PERIOD , THE ADMINISTRATION NOTIFIED THE PLAINTIFF THAT IT HAD DECIDED TO RENEW HIS CONTRACT FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT HIS PERFORMANCE WAS UNSATISFACTORY . IT ALSO GAVE WARNING THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A CONSIDERABLE IMPROVEMENT IN HIS WORK , FAILING WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE OBLIGED TO RECONSIDER HIS POSITION AND THE CONTINUANCE OF HIS ACTIVITIES IN THE SERVICE OF THE COMMISSION .       THE RENEWED CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD WAS SIGNED ON FEBRUARY BY BOTH PARTIES . THE SERVICE ASSESSMENTS IN RELATION TO THE PLAINTIFF DRAWN UP IN AND SHOW , ALBEIT WITH SOME RESERVATIONS , THAT HIS WORK WAS IN GENERAL SATISFACTORY .   AT THE TIME , THE PLAINTIFF PARTICIPATED SUCCESSFULLY IN AN INTERNAL COMPETITION ( COM/C/8/) FOLLOWING WHICH HE WAS APPOINTED ON JANUARY , WITH EFFECT FROM JANUARY OF THE SAME YEAR , AS A PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL IN THE CAPACITY OF CLERICAL ASSISTANT IN GRADE C AND ASSIGNED TO THE DIRECTORATE GENERAL FOR PERSONNEL AND ADMINISTRATION IN LUXEMBOURG . AN INTERNAL MEMORANDUM OF FEBRUARY STATES THAT ' ' THE CONTRACT AS A MEMBER OF THE LOCAL STAFF UNDER WHICH MR HUGUES DESMEDT WAS EMPLOYED IN THE SERVICE OF THE COMMISSION IN BRUSSELS HAS BEEN TERMINATED WITH EFFECT FROM THE EVENING OF DECEMBER ' ' . THAT MEMORANDUM WAS FORWARDED , INTER ALIA , TO THE DEPARTMENT IN WHICH THE PLAINTIFF WAS WORKING .   FOLLOWING AN UNFAVOURABLE ASSESSMENT IN THE REPORT DRAWN UP AT THE END OF THE PROBATIONARY PERIOD , THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY DECIDED ON JUNE TO DISMISS THE PLAINTIFF WITH EFFECT FROM JULY . IT APPEARS FROM THE FILE ON THE CASE THAT THE PLAINTIFF RECEIVED COMPENSATION FOR DISMISSAL , AS PROVIDED FOR IN THE FOURTH SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , WHICH IS THE EQUIVALENT OF TWO MONTHS '  BASIC SALARY IN THE CASE OF A PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL WHO HAS COMPLETED AT LEAST SIX MONTHS '  SERVICE . THE COMMISSION HAD ALSO , WITH THE INTENTION , AMONGST OTHER THINGS , OF ENABLING THE PLAINTIFF TO BECOME AFFILIATED ONCE AGAIN TO A NATIONAL SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEME , OFFERED HIM A CONTRACT , INVOLVING HIS BEING POSTED TO BRUSSELS , AS AN AUXILIARY SERVANT FOR A PERIOD STRICTLY LIMITED TO THREE MONTHS . HOWEVER , THAT OFFER WAS REJECTED BY THE PLAINTIFF .   FINALLY , IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE PLAINTIFF SUBMITTED ON SEPTEMBER A COMPLAINT AGAINST HIS DISMISSAL WHICH WAS REJECTED BY THE COMMISSION BY LETTER OF MARCH . IN THAT LETTER , THE COMMISSION STATED IN PARTICULAR THAT ' ' YOUR APPOINTMENT AS A PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL ON JANUARY , WHICH YOU ACCEPTED , NECESSARILY ENTAILED THE TERMINATION OF YOUR CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT GOVERNED BY PRIVATE LAW SINCE THE STATUS OF A MEMBER OF THE LOCAL STAFF IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THAT OF A PUBLIC SERVANT OF AN INSTITUTION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ' ' . THE PLAINTIFF DID NOT AVAIL HIMSELF OF THE FURTHER MEANS OF REDRESS PROVIDED FOR IN THE STAFF REGULATIONS AGAINST THE REJECTION OF HIS COMPLAINT .       BY A WRIT DATED DECEMBER , MR DESMEDT HAD MEANWHILE INSTITUTED PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL DU TRAVAIL , BRUSSELS , FOR AN ORDER REQUIRING THE COMMISSION TO PAY HIM DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT . IN THE DOCUMENT INITIATING THE PROCEEDINGS , HE CLAIMS THAT THE COMMISSION SHOULD EITHER HAVE REINSTATED HIM IN HIS FORMER POST OR PAID HIM DAMAGES IN LIEU OF NOTICE ESTIMATED AT BFR , EQUIVALENT TO SIX MONTHS '  SALARY CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO HIS LAST SALARY .   IN SUPPORT OF HIS APPLICATION , MR DESMEDT STATES THAT HIS APPOINTMENT AS A PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL MERELY SUSPENDED HIS CONTRACT AS A MEMBER OF THE LOCAL STAFF AND THAT THE CONTRACT SHOULD THEREFORE AGAIN HAVE TAKEN EFFECT FOLLOWING HIS DISMISSAL AS A PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL . HE COMPARES HIS SITUATION TO THAT OF A WORKER UNDER A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHO IS ASSIGNED TO NEW DUTIES FOR A TRIAL PERIOD AND HE REQUESTS THE NATIONAL COURT TO PROVIDE HIM WITH THE SAME DEGREE OF PROTECTION AS THAT WHICH THE COURTS WOULD AFFORD HIM IF THE SUCCEEDING CONTRACTS HAD BEEN CONCLUDED IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR .   THE COMMISSION POINTS OUT THAT THE EFFECT OF AN APPOINTMENT AS A PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL IS TO MAKE THE EMPLOYEE SUBJECT TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND NECESSARILY TERMINATES HIS CONTRACT AS A MEMBER OF THE LOCAL STAFF WHICH IS GOVERNED BY THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT .   TO RESOLVE THIS DISPUTE , THE TRIBUNAL DU TRAVAIL HAS SUBMITTED THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS TO THE COURT :    ' ' IS THE STATUS OF A PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , SUBJECT TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES OF SEPTEMBER , C , PP . TO , AND IN PARTICULAR ARTICLE ( ) THEREOF , COMPATIBLE OR INCOMPATIBLE WITH THAT OF A MEMBER OF THE LOCAL STAFF , SUBJECT TO THE PRIVATE LAW OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION , AS PUBLISHED IN THE SAME OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF SEPTEMBER , C , P . , ARTICLES TO , THAT IS , IN THE PRESENT CASE , AS REGARDS BELGIAN LEGISLATION , ARTICLE OF THE LAW OF JULY AND THE FORMER ARTICLE OF THE CONSOLIDATED LAWS OF EMPLOYMENT?  ' '       THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OTHER SERVANTS AND THE DETERMINATION OF THEIR RESPECTIVE FIELDS OF APPLICATION MUST BE DEFINED ON THE BASIS OF THE PROVISIONS UPON WHICH THE SYSTEM GOVERNING THE EUROPEAN PUBLIC SERVICE IS FOUNDED .   IT IS APPARENT FROM ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TREATY ESTABLISHING A SINGLE COUNCIL AND A SINGLE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES OF APRIL AS WELL AS FROM THE PREAMBLE TO REGULATION NO 259/OF THE COUNCIL OF FEBRUARY LAYING DOWN THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS AND THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OTHER SERVANTS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION , ( I ), P . ), ADOPTED PURSUANT TO THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PROVISION , THAT THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT CONSTITUTE TWO COMPLEMENTARY ACTS INASMUCH AS EACH GOVERNS SPECIFIC CATEGORIES OF SERVANTS : THE STAFF REGULATIONS APPLY TO OFFICIALS STRICTO SENSU AND TO PROBATIONARY OFFICIALS WHILST THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT APPLY TO A NUMBER OF OTHER CATEGORIES OF SERVANTS INCLUDING LOCAL STAFF . IT IS THUS APPARENT THAT THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT EACH COVER A CLEARLY DEFINED RANGE OF PERSONS AND THAT ACCORDINGLY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE , EXCEPT WHERE THERE IS AN EXPRESS DEROGATION , FOR A SERVANT TO COME SIMULTANEOUSLY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF BOTH OF THOSE ACTS LAID DOWN BY REGULATION .   IT FOLLOWS FROM THOSE CONSIDERATIONS THAT A MEMBER OF THE LOCAL STAFF WHO ACCEPTS AN APPOINTMENT AS A PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL IS SUBJECT TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS ALONE , THE APPLICATION OF WHICH AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATES THE RELATIONSHIPS FORMERLY GOVERNED BY THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT WITHOUT ITS BEING NECESSARY FOR THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS THEREUNDER TO BE TERMINATED EXPRESSLY BY THE ADMINISTRATION .   THE SITUATION MIGHT BE DIFFERENT ONLY WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION TAKES AN EXPRESS DECISION TO THE CONTRARY . IT IS NECESSARY TO ADD , MOREOVER , THAT THERE IS NOTHING TO PREVENT THE ADMINISTRATION FROM REINSTATING IN HIS FORMER POSITION , UPON THE EXPIRY OF THE PROBATIONARY PERIOD , A SERVANT FORMERLY SUBJECT TO THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT BUT THE POST WOULD THEN BE A NEW ONE AND THUS THERE WOULD BE NO RESUMPTION OF THE PREVIOUS EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP .       IT SHOULD ALSO BE OBSERVED THAT ALTHOUGH THE PROBATIONARY PERIOD UNDOUBTEDLY INVOLVES A MEASURE OF INSECURITY FOR THE PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL , HE IS NONE THE LESS PROTECTED AGAINST ANY ARBITRARY DISMISSAL BY THE MEANS OF REDRESS PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS . IN COMPARATIVE TERMS , HIS POSITION IN THAT REGARD IS NO MORE INSECURE THAN THAT OF A MEMBER OF THE LOCAL STAFF WHO MAY BE DISMISSED AT ANY TIME FOR INCOMPETENCE SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES AND TIME-LIMITS .   IN THE LIGHT OF THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS , THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION SUBMITTED SHOULD BE THAT THE STATUS OF A PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND THAT OF A MEMBER OF THE LOCAL STAFF WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT ARE INCOMPATIBLE INASMUCH AS THE ACQUISITION BY A MEMBER OF THE LOCAL STAFF OF THE STATUS OF PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL AUTOMATICALLY CAUSES THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT TO CEASE TO APPLY AND , CONSEQUENTLY , CAUSES THE CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT ENTERED INTO ON THE BASIS THEREOF TO CEASE TO HAVE EFFECT .  
Decision on costs
THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , WHICH HAS SUBMITTED OBSERVATIONS TO THE COURT , ARE NOT RECOVERABLE . AS THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE , IN SO FAR AS THE PARTIES TO THE MAIN ACTION ARE CONCERNED , IN THE NATURE OF A STEP IN THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE NATIONAL COURT , THE DECISION ON COSTS IS A MATTER FOR THAT COURT .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ( SECOND CHAMBER )   IN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION REFERRED TO IT BY THE TRIBUNAL DU TRAVAIL , BRUSSELS , BY JUDGMENT OF MARCH , HEREBY RULES :   THE STATUS OF A PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES AND THAT OF A MEMBER OF THE LOCAL STAFF WHO IS SUBJECT TO THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OTHER SERVANTS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ARE INCOMPATIBLE INASMUCH AS THE ACQUISITION BY A MEMBER OF THE LOCAL STAFF OF THE STATUS OF     PROBATIONARY OFFICIAL AUTOMATICALLY CAUSES THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OTHER SERVANTS TO CEASE TO APPLY AND , CONSEQUENTLY , CAUSES THE CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT ENTERED INTO ON THE BASIS THEREOF TO CEASE TO HAVE EFFECT .
