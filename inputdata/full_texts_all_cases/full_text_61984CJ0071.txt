Summary
. THE COMMUNITY CANNOT INCUR LIABILITY WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY UNLESS A SET OF CONDITIONS IS FULFILLED AS REGARDS THE UNLAWFULNESS OF THE ACTS ALLEGED AGAINST THE INSTITUTIONS , THE FACT OF DAMAGE AND THE EXISTENCE OF A DIRECT LINK IN THE CHAIN OF CAUSALITY BETWEEN THE WRONGFUL ACT AND THE DAMAGE COMPLAINED OF .  THE COMMUNITY DOES NOT INCUR LIABILITY IN THE CASE OF A LEGISLATIVE MEASURE WHICH INVOLVES CHOICES OF ECONOMIC POLICY UNLESS A SUFFICIENTLY SERIOUS BREACH OF A SUPERIOR RULE OF LAW FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL HAS OCCURRED .  . SINCE - AS MAY BE SEEN FROM REGULATION NO 2759/- PIGMEAT IS A PRODUCT FOR WHICH INTERVENTION MEASURES ARE PRESCRIBED , IT IS COVERED FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE SYSTEM OF MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS BY ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) OF REGULATION NO 974/AND HENCE COULD BE SUBJECT TO THOSE AMOUNTS AS A BASIC PRODUCT , EVEN THOUGH THE INTERVENTION MEASURES ACTUALLY ADOPTED HAVE BEEN LIMITED TO PRIVATE-STORAGE AID AND HAVE NOT TAKEN THE FORM OF PUBLIC BUYING-IN OPERATIONS . AS THE TRIGGERING OF INTERVENTION MEASURES DEPENDS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MARKET PRICE BY COMPARISON WITH THE BASIC PRICE , THE LATTER CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL FACTOR FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET , WITH THE RESULT THAT IT WAS PERMISSIBLE TO DECIDE THAT MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS FOR PIGMEAT WERE TO BE CALCULATED FROM A FRACTION OF THAT BASIC PRICE CORRESPONDING TO THE MINIMUM BUYING-IN PRICE LAID DOWN BY REGULATION NO 2759/AND , LATER , TO 90% THEREOF .  . THE FUNCTION OF MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS IS TO COUNTERACT THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH MIGHT ARISE FOR THE PROPER WORKING OF THE COMMON ORGANIZATIONS OF THE MARKET AS A RESULT OF CURRENCY INSTABILITY AND - AS MATTERS NOW STAND - DIVERGENCES BETWEEN THE REPRESENTATIVE RATES USED IN THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY AND THE CONVERSION RATES ON THE MARKET . SINCE THE OBJECTIVES PURSUED BY IMPORT LEVIES , ON THE ONE HAND , AND ' ACCESSION '  COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS , ON THE OTHER , DO NOT COINCIDE WITH THAT FUNCTION , MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS FOR PIGMEAT COULD BE CALCULATED IN A MANNER WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE METHODS ADOPTED FOR CALCULATING THE IMPORT LEVY AND THE ' ACCESSION '  COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO THE SAME PRODUCT .

Subject of the case
APPLICATION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR COMPENSATION FOR THE DAMAGE SUFFERED BY THE APPLICANTS ON ACCOUNT OF THE MAINTENANCE BY THE COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS OF MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS FOR THE PIGMEAT SECTOR WHICH WERE FIXED ILLEGALLY , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATIONS LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON MARCH , ROBERT SURCOUF AND JEAN VIDOU , PIG-FARMERS ESTABLISHED IN FRANCE , BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER ARTICLE AND THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY SEEKING AN ORDER THAT THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY , REPRESENTED BY THE COUNCIL AND COMMISSION , SHOULD MAKE GOOD THE DAMAGE WHICH THEY CLAIM TO HAVE SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' M.C.A.S ' ) APPLICABLE TO PIGMEAT .  IN THEIR APPLICATIONS THE APPLICANTS ASSERT THAT THE DEFENDANT INSTITUTIONS HAVE , BY KEEPING M.C.A.S IN FORCE IN THE PIGMEAT SECTOR , INFRINGED A NUMBER OF SUPERIOR RULES OF LAW WHICH PROTECT INDIVIDUALS . IN THAT CONNECTION THEY REFER , FIRST , TO ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY , WHICH , WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE TREATY , PROHIBITS ANY DISCRIMINATION ON GROUNDS OF NATIONALITY . SECONDLY , THEY RELY ON ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) AND ( C ) THEREOF , UNDER WHICH THE OBJECTIVES OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY ARE TO ENSURE A FAIR STANDARD OF LIVING FOR THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY AND TO STABILIZE MARKETS .  IN THE APPLICANTS '  VIEW THE BREACH OF THOSE HIGHER RULES OF LAW IS CONSTITUTED BY THE FACT THAT THE M.C.A.S APPLICABLE TO THE PIGMEAT MARKET HAVE FOR YEARS CAUSED IMBALANCES IN TRADE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY , TO THE DETRIMENT OF FRENCH PRODUCERS IN PARTICULAR , AND HAVE THEREBY GIVEN RISE TO DISTORTION IN COMPETITION AND TO DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN PRODUCERS FROM DIFFERENT MEMBER STATES , TO THE BENEFIT OF PRODUCERS IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY AND THE NETHERLANDS , WHICH BOTH HAVE POSITIVE M.C.A.S .  THE APPLICANTS FURTHER MAINTAIN THAT THE BASIS FOR THE CALCULATION OF M.C.A.S IN THE PIGMEAT SECTOR , WHICH WAS ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION IN AND RATIFIED BY THE COUNCIL IN , IS FIXED ILLEGALLY INASMUCH AS IT REPRESENTS A FRACTION OF THE BASIC PRICE FIXED BY THE COUNCIL EVERY YEAR .  THE APPLICANTS CLAIM TO HAVE SUFFERED DAMAGE TO THEIR PIG-FARMING BUSINESS AS A RESULT OF THE BREACH OF THOSE HIGHER RULES , AND THEY ESTIMATE THAT DAMAGE AS BEING EQUIVALENT TO THE ACTUAL M.C.A.S COLLECTED ON EXPORTATION BY NETHERLANDS PRODUCERS FOR EVERY 80-KILOGRAM PIG CARCASE - THAT FIGURE BEING MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF PIGS PRODUCED BY EACH OF THE APPLICANTS OVER THE FIVE YEARS BEFORE PROCEEDINGS WERE COMMENCED . THEY ALSO ARGUE THAT THEY SUFFERED CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE ON ACCOUNT OF THE M.C.A.S , IN THAT THEY WERE PREVENTED FROM IMPROVING THEIR FINANCIAL STANDING , THEIR PLANT AND THEIR PRODUCTIVITY . THEY ESTIMATE THE CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE AT 35% OF THE DIRECT DAMAGE .  IN CONCLUSION , MR SURCOUF CLAIMS THAT THE DEFENDANT INSTITUTIONS SHOULD BE ORDERED TO PAY HIM THE SUM OF FF BY WAY OF COMPENSATION , WHILST MR VIDOU DEMANDS FF . BOTH APPLICANTS FURTHER ASK THAT THE DEFENDANT INSTITUTIONS BE ORDERED TO BEAR THE COSTS .  THE DEFENDANT INSTITUTIONS OPPOSE THE APPLICANTS '  CLAIMS FOR COMPENSATION , ARGUING THAT THEY ARE NOT GUILTY IN THIS RESPECT OF ANY BREACH OF A HIGHER RULE OF LAW FOR THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUALS , THAT THE ALLEGED DAMAGE IS MERELY NOTIONAL , AND THAT THE APPLICANTS HAVE NOT ESTABLISHED ANY CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN THE SUPPOSEDLY ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF THE INSTITUTIONS AND THE DAMAGE FOR WHICH THE APPLICANTS SEEK COMPENSATION .  THE DEFENDANTS THEREFORE CONTEND THAT THE APPLICATION SHOULD BE DISMISSED AND THAT THE APPLICANTS SHOULD BE ORDERED TO BEAR THE COSTS .  BEFORE CONSIDERING THE SUBSTANCE OF THE APPLICANTS '  CLAIMS , IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE COURT HAS CONSISTENTLY HELD ( SEE IN PARTICULAR THE JUDGMENT OF DECEMBER , JOINED CASES TO , , AND 247/LUDWIGSHAFENER WALZMUHLE V COUNCIL AND COMMISSION ( ) ECR ) THAT THE COMMUNITY CANNOT INCUR LIABILITY WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY UNLESS A SET OF CONDITIONS IS FULFILLED AS REGARDS THE UNLAWFULNESS OF THE ACTS ALLEGED AGAINST THE INSTITUTIONS , THE FACT OF DAMAGE AND THE EXISTENCE OF A DIRECT LINK IN THE CHAIN OF CAUSALITY BETWEEN THE WRONGFUL ACT AND THE DAMAGE COMPLAINED OF .  DEALING WITH THE FIRST OF THOSE CONDITIONS THE COURT HELD , INTER ALIA , IN ITS JUDGMENT OF MAY ( JOINED CASES AND 94/, , AND 40/HNL V COUNCIL AND COMMISSION ( ) ECR ), THAT THE COMMUNITY DOES NOT INCUR LIABILITY ON ACCOUNT OF A LEGISLATIVE MEASURE WHICH INVOLVES CHOICES OF ECONOMIC POLICY UNLESS A SUFFICIENTLY SERIOUS BREACH OF A SUPERIOR RULE OF LAW FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL HAS OCCURRED .  IT IS NOT DISPUTED THAT IN THIS CASE THE MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE DEFENDANT INSTITUTIONS WHICH ALLEGEDLY CAUSED THE DAMAGE OF WHICH THE APPLICANTS COMPLAIN ARE LEGISLATIVE IN CHARACTER AND INVOLVE CHOICES OF ECONOMIC POLICY . IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO BEGIN BY CONSIDERING WHETHER THE CONDITIONS POSTULATED IN THE COURT ' S CASE-LAW IN ORDER FOR THE COMMUNITY TO BE HELD LIABLE IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES ARE FULFILLED .  IN THAT CONNECTION THE APPLICANTS '  CONTENTION THAT ARTICLE OF THE TREATY HAS BEEN INFRINGED SHOULD IMMEDIATELY BE RULED OUT . AS THE DEFENDANT INSTITUTIONS HAVE RIGHTLY CONTENDED , IN APPLYING THE SYSTEM OF M.C.A.S NO DISTINCTION IS MADE BETWEEN TRADERS ON GROUNDS OF NATIONALITY . THUS ARTICLE AND THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-DISCRIMINATION ON GROUNDS OF NATIONALITY CONTAINED THEREIN ARE NOT RELEVANT TO THIS DISPUTE .  AS FOR THE ALLEGATION OF AN INFRINGEMENT OF ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) AND ( C ) OF THE TREATY , THE APPLICANTS ASSERT THAT THE APPLICATION OF M.C.A.S TO THE PIGMEAT SECTOR IS CONTRARY TO THE OBJECTIVES OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY SET FORTH IN THAT ARTICLE , NAMELY TO ENSURE BY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT POLICY A FAIR STANDARD OF LIVING FOR THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY AND TO STABILIZE MARKETS .  THE APPLICANTS ARGUE , FIRST , THAT THE MAINTENANCE OF M.C.A.S FOR PIGMEAT HAD THE EFFECT OF UPSETTING THE MARKETS BY CAUSING DISTORTIONS IN COMPETITION AND DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN PRODUCERS IN DIFFERENT MEMBER STATES . THE APPLICANTS EMPHASIZE THAT , SINCE M.C.A.S HAVE BEEN APPLIED , PRODUCERS IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY AND THE NETHERLANDS - COUNTRIES WITH POSITIVE M.C.A.S - HAVE CONSIDERABLY INCREASED THEIR SHARE OF THE COMMUNITY MARKET , THEREBY HARMING FRENCH PRODUCERS .  THE DEFENDANT INSTITUTIONS BEGIN BY OBSERVING THAT ARTICLE DOES NOT CONTAIN HIGHER RULES OF LAW PROTECTING INDIVIDUALS FOR WHOSE BREACH THE COMMUNITY MAY INCUR NON-CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY . THE COUNCIL POINTS OUT THAT , IN ITS JUDGMENTS , THE COURT HAS RECOGNIZED THAT THE INSTITUTIONS ENJOY A BROAD MARGIN OF DISCRETION IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OBJECTIVES SET FORTH IN ARTICLE , AND HAS CONCEDED THAT IT IS IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES PERMISSIBLE TO GIVE ONE OF THOSE OBJECTIVES PRIORITY OVER THE OTHERS .  FURTHERMORE , THE COMMISSION DENIES THAT THE MAINTENANCE OF M.C.A.S FOR PIGMEAT HAS BROUGHT ABOUT THE DISRUPTION ALLEGED BY THE APPLICANTS . IT CONTENDS THAT PIGMEAT PRODUCTION HAS INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY , NOT ONLY IN MEMBER STATES WHERE THE M.C.A.S ARE POSITIVE BUT ALSO IN THOSE WHERE THEY ARE NEGATIVE . WHILST AGREEING WITH THE APPLICANTS THAT THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN THE MARKET SHARE HELD BY PRODUCERS FROM MEMBER STATES HAVING POSITIVE M.C.A.S , THE COMMISSION TAKES THE VIEW THAT THE PHENOMENON IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO FACTORS OTHER THAN THE APPLICATION OF M.C.A.S , AND IN THAT CONNECTION POINTS TO PIG-BREEDING CYCLES , THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW BREEDS , THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROCESSING INDUSTRIES AND THE USE BY NETHERLANDS BREEDERS OF FEEDS SUCH AS MANIOC WHICH ARE NOT SUBJECT TO M.C.A.S .  AS FAR AS FRANCE IS CONCERNED , THE COMMISSION SUBMITS THAT , WHILST THE SHARE OF THE NATIONAL MARKET HELD BY FRENCH PRODUCERS FELL SHARPLY IN , THE SITUATION DID NOT RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN IMPORTS FROM COUNTRIES HAVING POSITIVE M.C.A.S - SUCH AS THE NETHERLANDS - BUT WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE INCREASED CONSUMPTION OF PORK IN FRANCE WAS NOT MATCHED BY A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN PRODUCTION .  THE PLAUSIBILITY OF THOSE EXPLANATIONS IS BORNE OUT BY STATISTICS SUPPLIED BY THE COMMISSION AND NOT CONTESTED BY THE APPLICANTS , SHOWING THAT THE MAIN SUPPLIERS OF PIGMEAT TO FRANCE ARE THE COUNTRIES OF THE BELGO-LUXEMBOURG ECONOMIC UNION , AND NOT COUNTRIES HAVING POSITIVE M.C.A.S SUCH AS THE NETHERLANDS AND THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY . IT ALSO APPEARS FROM THE STATISTICS THAT ALTHOUGH EXPORTS TO FRANCE OF PIGS ORIGINATING IN THE NETHERLANDS HAVE INCREASED IN QUANTITATIVE TERMS , THEY HAVE REMAINED STEADY DURING RECENT YEARS AT AROUND 14% OF TOTAL NETHERLANDS EXPORTS OF THAT PRODUCT .  THUS THE CONCLUSION TO BE DRAWN IS THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT THE MAINTENANCE OF M.C.A.S IN THE PIGMEAT SECTOR HAS LED TO AN IMBALANCE IN THE MARKETS IN THAT SECTOR .  IN THE SECOND PLACE , BY WAY OF DEMONSTRATING THAT THE DEFENDANT INSTITUTIONS HAVE INFRINGED ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) AND ( C ), THE APPLICANTS CLAIM THAT THE METHOD ADOPTED BY THOSE INSTITUTIONS FOR CALCULATING THE M.C.A.S IS ILLEGAL .  IT SHOULD BE RECALLED THAT UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 974/OF THE COUNCIL OF MAY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( I ), P . ) M.C.A.S APPLY :    ' ( A ) TO PRODUCTS COVERED BY INTERVENTION ARRANGEMENTS UNDER THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF AGRICULTURAL MARKETS ;   ( B)TO PRODUCTS WHOSE PRICE DEPENDS ON THE PRICE OF THE PRODUCTS REFERRED TO UNDER ( A ) AND WHICH ARE GOVERNED BY THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF ( THE ) MARKET OR ARE THE SUBJECT OF A SPECIFIC ARRANGEMENT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE TREATY ' .  UNDER ARTICLE ( ) AND ( ) THE BASIS FOR CALCULATING M.C.A.S VARIES ACCORDING TO WHETHER THE PRODUCTS IN QUESTION ARE COVERED BY ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' BASIC PRODUCTS ' ) OR BY ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) ( ' DERIVED PRODUCTS ' ).  IN THE CASE OF PIGMEAT , EVEN SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF M.C.A.S , THE COMMISSION HAS REGARDED IT AS A BASIC PRODUCT FOR THE PURPOSE OF APPLYING THOSE AMOUNTS . INDEED , COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2759/OF OCTOBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN PIGMEAT , WHICH IS APPLICABLE TO THIS CASE , PROVIDES IN ARTICLE ( ) THAT ' INTERVENTION MEASURES MAY BE TAKEN WHEN THE COMMUNITY MARKET PRICE FOR PIG CARCASES . . . IS , AND IS LIKELY TO REMAIN , AT LESS THAN 103% OF THE BASIC PRICE ' .  UNDER ARTICLE OF THE REGULATION , INTERVENTION MEASURES MAY CONSIST OF AID FOR PRIVATE STORAGE OR OF BUYING-IN BY INTERVENTION AGENCIES . WITH REFERENCE TO THE LATTER MEASURE , ARTICLE ( ) PROVIDES THAT THE BUYING-IN PRICE MAY NOT BE MORE THAN 92% OR LESS THAN 85% OF THE BASIC PRICE . THAT MINIMUM THRESHOLD WAS CHANGED TO 78% BY COUNCIL REGULATION NO 1423/OF JUNE ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ).  THE PARTIES ARE , HOWEVER , AGREED THAT EVER SINCE - A YEAR IN WHICH IT LAUNCHED A BUYING-IN OPERATION ( SEE COMMISSION REGULATION NO 641/OF MARCH , JOURNAL OFFICIEL L , P . ) - THE COMMISSION HAS FIXED NO BUYING-IN PRICE BUT HAS CONFINED ITS MEASURES IN THAT SECTOR TO AWARDING AID FOR PRIVATE STORAGE .  IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THE COMMISSION DECIDED TO BASE ITS CALCULATION OF M.C.A.S FOR PIGMEAT ON THE MINIMUM BUYING-IN PRICE LAID DOWN BY ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 2759/- THAT IS TO SAY , FIRST 85% AND LATER 78% OF THE BASIC PRICE ( SEE REGULATIONS NOS 2630/OF OCTOBER , OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . , AND 1517/OF JUNE , OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ).  THE COUNCIL LATER DECIDED , IN REGULATION NO 2025/OF JULY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), TO INSERT IN ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 974/A NEW PARAGRAPH , NUMBERED 3A AND WORDED AS FOLLOWS :    ' THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS FOR PRODUCTS IN THE PIGMEAT SECTOR SHALL BE CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF 90% OF THE LOWER LIMIT OF THE BUYING-IN PRICE APPLICABLE TO PIG CARCASES . '  FOLLOWING THAT AMENDMENT , M.C.A.S FOR PIGMEAT HAVE BEEN CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF APPROXIMATELY 70% OF THE BASIC PRICE .  IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT A LATER AMENDMENT TO ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 974/, INTRODUCED BY COUNCIL REGULATION NO 855/OF MARCH ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) - WHICH DOES NOT APPLY TO THE PRESENT FACTS - PROVIDED THAT , FROM JANUARY ONWARDS , PIGMEAT WAS TO BE TREATED FOR THE PURPOSES OF APPLYING M.C.A.S AS A PRODUCT DERIVED FROM CEREALS . CONSEQUENTLY , M.C.A.S FOR PIGMEAT ARE EQUAL TO THE INCIDENCE ON THE PRICE OF PIGMEAT OF THE APPLICATION OF M.C.A.S TO CEREAL PRICES .  THE APPLICANTS MAINTAIN THAT , SINCE NO BUYING-IN PRICE HAS BEEN FIXED FOR PIGMEAT SINCE , THE DEFENDANT INSTITUTIONS COULD NOT APPLY TO PIGMEAT M.C.A.S CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF A FRACTION OF THE BASIC PRICE - THAT IS , ON A FICTITIOUS BUYING-IN PRICE . ACCORDING TO THE APPLICANTS , M.C.A.S MAY NOT BE APPLIED EXCEPT WITHIN A SYSTEM OF PRICES GUARANTEED BY INTERVENTION MEASURES .  THE APPLICANTS FURTHER MAINTAIN THAT , IN THE ABSENCE OF A BUYING-IN PRICE CAPABLE OF AFFORDING A BASIS FOR CALCULATING M.C.A.S , THOSE AMOUNTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIXED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 974/; THEY SHOULD THEREFORE HAVE BEEN EQUAL TO THE INCIDENCE ON PIGMEAT PRICES OF THE APPLICATION OF M.C.A.S TO THE PRICE OF THE BASIC PRODUCT ON WHICH PIGMEAT DEPENDS , NAMELY CEREALS . THE APPLICANTS POINT OUT THAT THE LEVY ON PIGMEAT IMPORTS FROM NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES IS CALCULATED , IN PART , ON THE BASIS OF THE QUANTITY OF FEED GRAIN REQUIRED FOR THE PRODUCTION IN THE COMMUNITY OF ONE KILOGRAM OF PIGMEAT ( ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) OF REGULATION NO 2759/, MENTIONED ABOVE ). THE SAME METHOD WAS ADOPTED IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THE ACCESSION TREATY OF , WITH REFERENCE TO ' ACCESSION '  COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS .  THE APPLICANTS SUBMIT LASTLY THAT THE VALIDITY OF THAT METHOD FOR THE CALCULATION OF M.C.A.S IS BORNE OUT BY THE ADOPTION OF REGULATION NO 855/, MENTIONED ABOVE , BY VIRTUE OF WHICH PIGMEAT WAS THEREAFTER TREATED AS A PRODUCT DERIVED FROM CEREALS FOR THE PURPOSE OF APPLYING M.C.A.S .  IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE OBSERVED THAT , AS MAY BE SEEN FROM REGULATION NO 2759/ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN PIGMEAT , PIGMEAT IS A PRODUCT FOR WHICH INTERVENTION MEASURES ARE PRESCRIBED . THERE CAN THEREFORE BE NO DOUBT THAT PIGMEAT WAS COVERED BY ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) OF REGULATION NO 974/, AND HENCE COULD BE SUBJECT TO M.C.A.S AS A BASIC PRODUCT , PROVIDED THAT THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF SUCH AMOUNTS WERE FULFILLED .  THE FACT THAT INTERVENTION MEASURES FOR PIGMEAT AT THE MATERIAL PERIOD CONSISTED SOLELY OF AID FOR PRIVATE STORAGE IN NO WAY INVALIDATES THAT CONCLUSION . NOWHERE DOES REGULATION NO 974/REQUIRE THAT , IN ORDER TO BE REGARDED AS A BASIC PRODUCT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE APPLICATION OF M.C.A.S , A PRODUCT MUST ACTUALLY BE THE SUBJECT OF PUBLIC BUYING-IN OPERATIONS , NOR DOES IT INDICATE THAT THE INITIATION OF A SERIES OF PRIVATE-STORAGE AID OPERATIONS IS NOT SUFFICIENT .  ON THE OTHER HAND , IT MUST BE RECOGNIZED THAT , EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY PUBLIC BUYING-IN OPERATIONS , PIGMEAT WAS AND IS SUBJECT TO AN INTERVENTION SCHEME . AS THE COMMISSION HAS RIGHTLY ARGUED , THAT SCHEME IS GOVERNED BY THE BASIC PRICE , SINCE IT IS NOT UNTIL THE COMMUNITY MARKET PRICE IS , AND IS LIKELY TO REMAIN , AT LESS THAN 103% OF THE BASIC PRICE THAT INTERVENTION MEASURES , WHETHER IN THE FORM OF BUYING-IN BY INTERVENTION AGENCIES OR OF AID FOR PRIVATE STORAGE , MAY BE TAKEN PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 2759/.   THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE BASIC PRICE AND THE TRIGGERING OF INTERVENTION MEASURES ALSO DEMONSTRATES THAT THE BASIC PRICE , FAR FROM BEING ARTIFICIAL IN CHARACTER , CORRESPONDS TO A FACTOR OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO THE MANAGEMENT OF THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN QUESTION - WITH THE CONSEQUENCE THAT FIRST THE COMMISSION AND THEN THE COUNCIL WERE ENTITLED TO DECIDE THAT M.C.A.S FOR PIGMEAT SHOULD BE CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO A PROPORTION OF THE BASIC PRICE CORRESPONDING TO THE MINIMUM BUYING-IN PRICE LAID DOWN BY REGULATION NO 2759/OR , ONCE REGULATION NO 2025/ENTERED INTO FORCE , 90% OF THAT PRICE .  IT SHOULD BE ADDED THAT THE FACT OF CHOOSING THE MINIMUM BUYING-IN PRICE AND , LATER , 90% THEREOF AS A POINT OF REFERENCE FOR THE CALCULATION OF M.C.A.S HAD THE EFFECT OF PROGRESSIVELY REDUCING THE BASIS FOR CALCULATING M.C.A.S FOR PIGMEAT ; THE BASIS DECLINED FROM 92% TO AROUND 70% OF THE BASIC PRICE . THAT RESULT IS IN KEEPING WITH THE POLICIES WHICH HAVE LONG BEEN EXPRESSED BY THE DEFENDANT INSTITUTIONS , OF PROGRESSIVELY DISMANTLING M.C.A.S .  THE ADOPTION IN PURSUANCE OF THOSE AIMS OF A NEW METHOD OF CALCULATING M.C.A.S FOR PIGMEAT , AS PRESCRIBED BY REGULATION NO 855/, AND THE CONSEQUENT REDUCTION OF THOSE AMOUNTS , MAY NOT IN ANY EVENT SERVE TO CAST DOUBT ON EARLIER DECISIONS , WHICH WERE ADOPTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS PREVAILING AT THAT TIME .  IT IS SIMILARLY IRRELEVANT IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS DISPUTE TO POINT - AS THE APPLICANTS HAVE DONE - EITHER TO THE METHOD OF CALCULATING THE IMPORT LEVY OR TO THE ' ACCESSION '  COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS PRESCRIBED BY ARTICLE ( ) OF THE ACCESSION TREATY .  INDEED , AS THE COURT HELD IN ITS JUDGMENT OF FEBRUARY ( CASE 113/SCHOUTEN ( ) ECR ), THE AIM OF THE AGRICULTURAL LEVY IS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRICE ON THE WORLD MARKET AND THE HIGHER COMMUNITY PRICE , SO AS TO PROTECT AND STABILIZE THE COMMUNITY MARKET WHILST PREVENTING PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE WORLD MARKET FROM HAVING REPERCUSSIONS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY .  AS REGARDS THE ' ACCESSION '  COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS , THE COURT HAS HAD OCCASION TO POINT OUT IN ITS JUDGMENT OF JULY ( CASE 6/UNION FRANCAISE DES CEREALES ( ) ECR ) THAT THEIR FUNCTION WAS TO COMPENSATE FOR ANY DIFFERENCE WHICH MAY HAVE PERSISTED DURING THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD , BETWEEN THE PRICES FIXED FOR THE NEW MEMBER STATES AND THE COMMON PRICES , AND THEREBY TO FACILITATE THE TRANSITION OF THOSE STATES FROM THEIR PREVIOUS STATUS AS NON-MEMBER COUNTRIES TO THEIR NEW STATUS AS MEMBER STATES .  THE OBJECTIVES PURSUED BY IMPORT LEVIES , ON THE ONE HAND , AND ' ACCESSION '  COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS , ON THE OTHER , DO NOT THEREFORE COINCIDE WITH THE FUNCTION PERFORMED BY M.C.A.S , NAMELY TO COUNTERACT THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH MIGHT ARISE FOR THE PROPER WORKING OF THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET AS A RESULT OF CURRENCY INSTABILITY AND - AS MATTERS NOW STAND - DIVERGENCES BETWEEN THE REPRESENTATIVE RATES USED IN THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY AND THE CONVERSION RATES ON THE MARKET .  CONSEQUENTLY , NO IMPORTANCE MAY BE ATTACHED TO THE FACT THAT M.C.A.S FOR PIGMEAT WERE FOR A LONG TIME CALCULATED IN A MANNER WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE METHOD OF CALCULATING IMPORT LEVIES AND ' ACCESSION '  COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO THE SAME PRODUCT .  IT MUST THEREFORE BE CONCLUDED THAT THE ARGUMENTS BROUGHT BY THE APPLICANTS HAVE NOT DISCLOSED ANY INFRINGEMENT OF ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) AND ( C ) OF THE EEC TREATY .  THAT BEING SO , IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE OTHER CONDITIONS POSTULATED IN THE COURT ' S CASE-LAW IN ORDER FOR THE COMMUNITY TO INCUR NON-CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY UNDER THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY ARE FULFILLED .  THE APPLICATION MUST THEREFORE BE DISMISSED .
