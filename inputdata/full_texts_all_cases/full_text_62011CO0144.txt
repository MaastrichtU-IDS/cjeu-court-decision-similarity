Preliminary rulings – Admissibility – Questions asked without giving details enough of the factual background – Manifest inadmissibility (Art. TFEU; Statute of the Court of Justice, Art. 23; Rules of Procedure of the General Court,

Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Giudice di pace di Mestre – Direct applicability of Directive 2008/115/EC of the European
                  Parliament and of the Council of December on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally
                  staying third-country nationals (OJ L 348, p. 98) – Interpretation of Article of that directive – National legislation
                  providing for a fine of between EUR and EUR to be imposed on a foreign national who unlawfully enters, or remains
                  in, national territory, and also empowers the court to substitute for that fine deportation for a period of less than five
                  years, in the case of a criminal conviction.

The reference for a preliminary ruling made by the Giudice di pace di Mestre (Italy), by decision of March 2011, is manifestly
         inadmissible.
