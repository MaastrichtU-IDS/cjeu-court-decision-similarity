Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Tribunale Ordinario di Milano (Italy) – Interpretation of Articles EC and EC –
                  Equal treatment in employment matters – Grant of survivor’s benefit – National rules providing for differences in treatment
                  between surviving spouses and surviving partners who were in a life partnership.
               
Operative part
Community law does not impose a prohibition of all discrimination, the application of which the courts of Member States must
         ensure, where the allegedly discriminatory treatment has no link with Community law. In circumstances such as those at issue
         in the main proceedings, no such link arises from Articles EC and EC in themselves.
      
Those articles do not preclude, in those circumstances, national rules under which, in the event of the death of a person
         as a result of an accident, a pension amounting to 50% of the remuneration received by that person before his death is paid
         solely to his surviving spouse and the infant child of the deceased receives only a pension amounting to 20% of that remuneration.
