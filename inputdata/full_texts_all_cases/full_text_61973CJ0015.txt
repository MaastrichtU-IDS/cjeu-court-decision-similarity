Subject of the case
IN THE MATTER - AT THE PRESENT STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS - OF THE ADMISSIBILITY OF APPLICATIONS FOR PAYMENT TO THE APPLICANTS OF ARREARS OF EXPATRIATION ALLOWANCE AND, TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY, THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISIONS ON THE PART OF THE DEFENDANTS WITHDRAWING OR REFUSING THEM THE BENEFIT OF THIS ALLOWANCE . 
Grounds
THE ACTIONS, FILED AT THE COURT BETWEEN FEBRUARY AND MAY 1973, ARE FOR PAYMENT TO THE APPLICANTS OF ARREARS OF EXPATRIATION ALLOWANCE CALCULATED FROM THE DAY WHEN THIS WAS WITHDRAWN OR REFUSED, IN APPLICATION OF ARTICLE ( B ) OF ANNEX VII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS, UP TO THE DATE WHEN IT WAS RESTORED TO THEM .  THEY ARE FURTHER FOR ANNULMENT - TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY - OF THE DEFENDANTS' DECISIONS WITHDRAWING OR REFUSING THE APPLICANTS THE BENEFIT OF THE EXPATRIATION ALLOWANCE, AND OF THE DECISIONS REJECTING THEIR COMPLAINTS WITH A VIEW TO OBTAINING THE GRANT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR THE PERIOD PRIOR TO JULY .  BY PRELIMINARY DOCUMENTS, ON THE BASIS OF ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE DEFENDANTS RAISED ARGUMENTS OF INADMISSIBILITY BY REASON OF THE LATENESS OF THE APPEALS, ARGUING THAT THESE HAD NOT BEEN LODGED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULES LAID DOWN BY ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  UNDER ARTICLE 91, AN APPEAL TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE SHALL LIE ONLY IF THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY HAS PREVIOUSLY HAD A COMPLAINT SUBMITTED TO IT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) WITHIN THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED THEREIN .  UNDER ARTICLE 90, ANY COMPLAINT AGAINST AN ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING AN OFFICIAL MUST BE SUBMITTED TO THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY WITHIN A PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF NOTIFICATION OF THE DECISION TO THE PERSON CONCERNED BUT IN NO CASE LATER THAN THE DATE ON WHICH THE LATTER BECAME AWARE OF IT .  A SIMPLE EXAMINATION OF THE DATES OF WITHDRAWAL OR REFUSAL OF THE EXPATRIATION ALLOWANCE ON THE ONE HAND AND THE DATES OF THE APPEALS ON THE OTHER, SHOWS THAT THE LATTER ARE INADMISSIBLE SINCE THEY WERE LODGED AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE TIME LIMITS LAID DOWN BY ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  THE APPLICANTS RETORT THAT THE APPEALS ARE IN THE FIRST PLACE ACTIONS FOR PAYMENT OF ARREARS AND THAT SUCH ACTIONS CONSTITUTE AN AUTONOMOUS FORM OF ACTION WHICH IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE TIME LIMITS OF ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  THE ACTIONS DESCRIBED IN THIS WAY IN FACT SEEK TO OBTAIN THE ANNULMENT OF DECISIONS TAKEN BY THE DEFENDANT INSTITUTIONS AND ARE BASED ON THE ALLEGED ILLEGALITY OF THOSE DECISIONS .  IN NONE OF THE APPLICATIONS IS THE PAYMENT CLAIMED PRESENTED AS A CLAIM FOR COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE INSTITUTIONS .  EVEN IF THE APPLICANTS INTENDED TO CLAIM COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE INSTITUTIONS IN THE EXERCISE OF THEIR FUNCTIONS, SUCH AN ACTION IN THE PRESENT CASE HAS ITS ORIGIN IN THE ALLEGED ILLEGALITY OF THE INSTITUTIONS' DECISIONS AND CANNOT THEREFORE BE DISTINGUISHED FROM AN ACTION FOR ANNULMENT .  THE BASIS FOR THE APPEALS THUS LIES EXCLUSIVELY IN ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY, WHICH PROVIDES THAT THE COURT SHALL HAVE JURISDICTION IN ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND ITS SERVANTS WITHIN THE LIMITS AND UNDER THE CONDITIONS LAID DOWN IN THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  THE APPEALS ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO THE TIME LIMITS OF ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  THIS ARGUMENT MUST THEREFORE BE REJECTED .  SOME OF THE APPLICANTS MAINTAIN THAT TIME HAS NOT STARTED RUNNING AGAINST THEM, SINCE THE ORIGINAL DECISIONS WITHDRAWING OR REFUSING THE EXPATRIATION ALLOWANCE WERE NOT PROPERLY COMMUNICATED TO THEM IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  THE APPLICANTS COULD HAVE REALIZED THAT THEIR ALLOWANCE HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN OR REFUSED ONLY BY READING THEIR SALARY STATEMENTS, WITHOUT THERE HAVING IN THIS RESPECT BEEN ANY EXPRESS AND REASONED WRITTEN COMMUNICATION .  A SALARY STATEMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A DECISION WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  IT IS NOT DENIED THAT THE APPLICANTS HAD KNOWLEDGE OF THE DECISIONS RESULTING IN THE WITHDRAWAL OR REFUSAL TO THEM OF THE EXPATRIATION ALLOWANCE MORE THAN THREE MONTHS BEFORE THE MAKING OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT .  THE SENDING OF THE MONTHLY SALARY STATEMENT HAS THE EFFECT OF STARTING THE TIME FOR APPEAL RUNNING, WHERE IT CLEARLY SHOWS THE DECISION TAKEN .  IN THE PRESENT CASE THIS CONDITION IS FULFILLED .  THIS GROUND OF APPEAL MUST ACCORDINGLY BE REJECTED .  FINALLY, THE APPLICANTS RAISE VARIOUS ARGUMENTS WITH A VIEW TO SHOWING THAT TIME HAD IN ANY EVENT STARTED TO RUN AFRESH IN THEIR CASE .  ONE OF THE APPLICANTS IN THIS RESPECT MAINTAINS THAT THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ( ) OF ANNEX VII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS AMOUNT TO ILLEGALITY OF SO STRIKING A KIND THAT THEY MUST BE CONSIDERED AS 'NON-EXISTENT '.  THE FINDING OF NON-EXISTENCE OF A RULE IS SAID TO RELIEVE THE APPLICANT FROM BEING TIME-BARRED BY REASON OF THE EXPIRY OF THE TIME-LIMITS FOR APPEAL .  ALL THE APPLICANTS REFER FOR THE SAME PURPOSE TO THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN 'NEW FACTS '.  THE COURT'S JUDGMENTS OF JUNE IN CASE 20/71, SABBATINI V EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND CASE 32/71, BAUDUIN V COMMISSION ARE SAID TO AMOUNT TO A NEW FACT .  THE GROUND OF ANNULMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS PRONOUNCED BY THESE JUDGMENTS WAS THE ILLEGALITY FOUND TO EXIST IN ARTICLE ( ) OF ANNEX VII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS;  IT IS PRECISELY BY APPLICATION OF THIS PROVISION, FOUND TO HAVE BEEN ILLEGAL, THAT THE BENEFIT OF THE EXPATRIATION ALLOWANCE WAS WITHDRAWN OR REFUSED TO THE APPLICANTS .  THE DECISIONS TAKEN BY THE DEFENDANT INSTITUTIONS CONSEQUENT UPON THE COURT'S JUDGMENT, WITH A VIEW TO GRANTING HENCEFORTH - OR RESTORING - THE ALLOWANCE TO THE APPLICANTS AS FROM JULY 1972, IS SAID TO CONSTITUTE A SECOND NEW FACT .  THESE DECISIONS MIGHT BE TERMED A GENERAL CHANGE OF DIRECTION IN ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE, AND ARE SAID THUS TO CONSTITUTE A NEW FACT .  FOLLOWING UPON THE COURT'S JUDGMENTS OF JUNE AND THE STEPS TAKEN BY THE INSTITUTIONS, FIRST IN FAVOUR OF THE APPLICANTS INDIVIDUALLY AND SUBSEQUENTLY IN FAVOUR OF ALL THE OFFICIALS, BY THE MODIFICATIONS MADE IN THE STAFF REGULATIONS, THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL TREATMENT OF OFFICIALS IN ITS APPLICATION TO THE PROBLEM OF THE EXPATRIATION ALLOWANCE TO BE GRANTED TO FEMALE OFFICIALS, IS NO LONGER IN ISSUE .  THE APPEALS ARE SOLELY FOR PAYMENT TO THE APPLICANTS OF ARREARS OF EXPATRIATION ALLOWANCE FOR THE PERIOD PRIOR TO THE DECISIONS MENTIONED .  IT THEREFORE APPEARS THAT THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPEALS MUST BE JUDGED WITH DUE REGARD TO THE NEED FOR LEGAL CERTAINTY, INDISPENSABLE TO THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF THE COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS, REFLECTED IN THE FIXING OF TIME LIMITS BY ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  IN ANY EVENT THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ( ) OF ANNEX VII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS CANNOT BE TERMED 'NON-EXISTENT', ORIGINATING AS IT DOES WITH THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY AND TAKEN WITH DUE REGARD TO THE PROCEDURAL AND FORMAL CONDITIONS LAID DOWN BY THE TREATIES .  IN THE FIRST PLACE THE PARTIES TREAT AS 'NEW FACTS' THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT FOLLOWING UPON THE JUDGMENTS OF JUNE 1972, THE PROVISION IN ARTICLE ( ) OF ANNEX VII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN DEFECTIVE, AND ACCORDINGLY INVALID AS FROM THE COMING INTO FORCE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  SECONDLY, THEY TAKE THIS VIEW OF THE DECISIONS, CONSEQUENT UPON THE SAME JUDGMENTS OF THE COURT, TAKEN IN RESPECT OF THEM BY THE DEFENDANT INSTITUTIONS, BEARING IN MIND THAT THE EFFECT OF THESE DECISIONS WAS THE RECOGNITION WITH RETROSPECTIVE EFFECT OF THE NONVALIDITY OF THE PROVISION IN THE STAFF REGULATIONS MENTIONED .  THE JUDGMENTS OF JUNE HAVE THE AUTHORITY OF RES JUDICATA ONLY IN RELATION TO THE PARTIES INVOLVED AT THAT TIME .  IT IS RIGHT TO POINT OUT MOREOVER THAT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PRONOUNCED THE ANNULMENT OF THE REGULATORY PROVISION INVOLVED, WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE 174, FIRST PARAGRAPH, BUT THAT THEY SIMPLY PLACED ON RECORD THE INAPPLICABILITY OF THIS PROVISION AND CONSEQUENT UPON THIS PRONOUNCED THE ANNULMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS TAKEN ON THAT BASIS .  IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE JUDGMENTS CANNOT BE RELIED UPON BY PARTIES WHO AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME OMITTED TO MAKE USE OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF APPEAL OFFERED TO THEM BY THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND BY THE TREATY .  THE GENERAL CHANGE IN DIRECTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE FOLLOWING UPON THESE JUDGMENTS MUST IN THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES BE CONSIDERED AS THE ANTICIPATED APPLICATION OF A FORMAL AMENDMENT IN THE STAFF REGULATIONS BUT MUST NOT BE UNDERSTOOD AS PERMITTING THE RETROSPECTIVE RE-OPENING OF A SITUATION RESULTING FROM DECISIONS TAKEN IN RELATION TO THE APPLICANTS, WHICH AT THE EXPIRY OF THE TIME LIMITS FOR APPEALS HAD BECOME FINAL .  THESE PLEAS MUST THEREFORE BE REJECTED .  IT FOLLOWS FROM THE FOREGOING TAKEN TOGETHER THAT THE APPEALS WERE PRESENTED OUT OF TIME AND THAT FOR THAT REASON THEY MUST BE DECLARED INADMISSIBLE .  
Decision on costs
THE APPLICANTS HAVE FAILED IN THEIR ACTIONS .  UNDER THE TERMS OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY SHALL BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .  HOWEVER, UNDER THE TERMS OF ARTICLE OF THE SAID RULES, THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE INSTITUTIONS IN ACTIONS BROUGHT BY EMPLOYEES OF THE COMMUNITY ARE TO BE BORNE BY SUCH INSTITUTIONS .  
Operative part
THE COURT ( SECOND CHAMBER )  HEREBY :  . DISMISSES THE ACTIONS AS INADMISSIBLE;  . ORDERS EACH PARTY TO BEAR ITS OWN COSTS .
