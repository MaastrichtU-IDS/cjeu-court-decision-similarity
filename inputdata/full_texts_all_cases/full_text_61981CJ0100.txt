Grounds
BY APPLICATION RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON APRIL THE COMMISSION BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT BY NOT ADOPTING WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 74/561/EEC OF NOVEMBER ON ADMISSION TO THE OCCUPATION OF ROAD-HAULAGE OPERATOR IN NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORT OPERATIONS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS HAD FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY .   PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 74/561/EEC , THE MEMBER STATES WERE REQUIRED TO ADOPT THE MEASURES NEEDED IN ORDER TO CONFORM WITH THAT DIRECTIVE WITHIN A PERIOD WHICH EXPIRED ON JANUARY .    THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DENY THAT IT HAS NOT FULLY COMPLIED WITH THAT OBLIGATION . IT CLAIMS ON THE OTHER HAND THAT THE CONDITIONS REQUIRED BY THE COMMUNITY RULES REGARDING THE OCCUPATIONAL SKILLS AND FINANCIAL STANDING OF THE OWNERS OF TRANSPORT UNDERTAKINGS HAVE BEEN SATISFIED IN THE NETHERLANDS FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME . THE ONLY POINT REMAINING TO BE DEALT WITH IS THE CONDITION REGARDING THE GOOD REPUTE OF HAULAGE OPERATORS . IN THAT RESPECT , THE DELAY TO WHICH ATTENTION HAS BEEN DRAWN MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR     BY THE OBLIGATION CREATED BY THE JUDGMENTS DELIVERED BY THE COURT ON MARCH IN CASES AND 146/( AUGUSTIJN AND WATTENBERG ( ) ECR AND ), AS A RESULT OF WHICH THE DRAFT LAW ALREADY ADOPTED BY THE FIRST CHAMBER OF THE STATES GENERAL MUST BE AMENDED SO THAT IT CONFORMS WITH ALL THE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY THE DIRECTIVE IN QUESTION .   THESE CIRCUMSTANCES CANNOT EXPUNGE THE FAILURE TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS , WITH WHICH THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS IS CHARGED . ACCORDING TO WELL-ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW , A MEMBER STATE MAY NOT PLEAD PROVISIONS , PRACTICES OR CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING IN ITS INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OBLIGATIONS RESULTING FROM COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES .   IT MUST THEREFORE BE DECLARED THAT BY NOT ADOPTING WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NEEDED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE NO 74/OF NOVEMBER , THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ONE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TREATY .
