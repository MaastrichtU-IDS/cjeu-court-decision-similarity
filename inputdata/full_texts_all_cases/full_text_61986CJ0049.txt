Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON FEBRUARY 1986, THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION BEFORE THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT, BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 82/76/EEC OF JANUARY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL, L 43, P . ) AMENDING DIRECTIVE 75/362/EEC CONCERNING THE MUTUAL RECOGNITION OF DIPLOMAS, CERTIFICATES AND OTHER EVIDENCE OF FORMAL QUALIFICATIONS IN MEDICINE, INCLUDING MEASURES TO FACILITATE EFFECTIVE EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT OF ESTABLISHMENT AND FREEDOM TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND DIRECTIVE 75/363/EEC CONCERNING THE COORDINATION OF PROVISIONS LAID DOWN BY LAW, REGULATION OR ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION IN RESPECT OF ACTIVITIES OF DOCTORS, THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY .  ARTICLE OF DIRECTIVE 82/76/EEC PROVIDES THAT THE MEMBER STATES ARE TO TAKE THE NECESSARY MEASURES TO COMPLY WITH THE DIRECTIVE BY DECEMBER AT THE LATEST AND TO INFORM FORTHWITH THE COMMISSION THEREOF .  SINCE THE COMMISSION HAD RECEIVED NO INFORMATION FROM THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT CONCERNING THE MEASURES ADOPTED FOR THE TRANSPOSITION INTO NATIONAL LAW OF THE DIRECTIVE AT ISSUE WITH REGARD TO FULL-TIME AND PART-TIME TRAINING FOR MEDICAL SPECIALISTS, IT GAVE THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT FORMAL NOTICE, ON JANUARY 1984, TO SUBMIT ITS OBSERVATIONS . HAVING NOTED THAT THE DRAFT LAW ANNOUNCED BY THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT HAD NOT BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE PARLIAMENT, AND HAVING RECEIVED NO REPLY TO THE REASONED OPINION DELIVERED ON MARCH 1984, THE COMMISSION BROUGHT THIS ACTION .  REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE REPORT FOR THE HEARING FOR A FULLER ACCOUNT OF THE FACTS, THE PROCEDURE, AND THE SUBMISSIONS AND ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES, WHICH ARE MENTIONED OR DISCUSSED HEREINAFTER ONLY IN SO FAR AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE REASONING OF THE COURT .  THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT ADMITS THAT IT HAS NOT FULFILLED ITS OBLIGATIONS . AT THE HEARING, IT STATED THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN POSSIBLE FOR THE LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURE IN REGARD TO THE ABOVEMENTIONED DRAFT LAW TO TAKE A NORMAL COURSE BY REASON OF THE DELICATE PROBLEMS RAISED BY THE DRAFT LAW, IN PARTICULAR IN REGARD TO THE NUMERUS CLAUSUS FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS .  IT SHOULD BE POINTED OUT THAT THE COURT HAS CONSISTENTLY HELD THAT A MEMBER STATE MAY NOT PLEAD PROVISIONS, PRACTICES OR CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING IN ITS INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OBLIGATIONS AND TIME-LIMITS RESULTING FROM COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES .  CONSEQUENTLY, IT MUST BE HELD THAT, BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 82/76/EEC OF JANUARY 1982, THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY .
