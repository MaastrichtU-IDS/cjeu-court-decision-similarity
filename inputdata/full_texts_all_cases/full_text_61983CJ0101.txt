Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1408/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE APPLICATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEMES TO EMPLOYED PERSONS AND THEIR FAMILIES MOVING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P . ), 
Grounds
BY ORDER OF OCTOBER , WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON MAY , THE CENTRALE RAAD VAN BEROEP ( COURT OF LAST INSTANCE IN SOCIAL SECURITY MATTERS ) REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY TWO QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1408/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE APPLICATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEMES TO EMPLOYED PERSONS AND THEIR FAMILIES MOVING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION ( II ), P . ).   THE QUESTIONS WERE RAISED IN PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY P . BRUSSE AGAINST THE RAAD VAN ARBEID ( LABOUR COUNCIL ), AMSTERDAM .   HAVING PREVIOUSLY WORKED IN THE NETHERLANDS , MR BRUSSE , A NETHERLANDS NATIONAL , HAS LIVED AND WORKED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM SINCE SEPTEMBER . ACCORDING TO ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION OF THE MEMBER STATE IN WHICH HE WAS EMPLOYED , THAT IS TO SAY , IN RELATION TO THE PERIOD COMMENCING ON SEPTEMBER , THE UNITED KINGDOM . HOWEVER , HE WAS NEVER AFFILIATED TO THE UNITED KINGDOM SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEME AND CONTINUED TO PAY VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE NETHERLANDS SCHEME .   WHEN THE IRREGULARITY OF MR BRUSSE ' S SITUATION WAS DISCOVERED IN THE RELEVANT UNITED KINGDOM AND NETHERLANDS AUTHORITIES DECIDED , IN VIEW OF     THE FACT THAT THE IRREGULARITY HAD EXISTED FOR SEVERAL YEARS , TO CONCLUDE AN AGREEMENT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1408/.    ARTICLE IS WORDED AS FOLLOWS :    ' ' TWO OR MORE MEMBER STATES OR THE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES OF THOSE STATES MAY , BY COMMON AGREEMENT , PROVIDE FOR EXCEPTIONS TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES AND IN THE INTEREST OF CERTAIN WORKERS OR CATEGORIES OF WORKERS . ' '   ACCORDING TO THE AGREEMENT RELATING TO MR BRUSSE CONCLUDED BY THOSE AUTHORITIES HE WAS TO BE REGARDED AS SUBJECT TO THE NETHERLANDS SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEME FOR THE PERIOD ENDING ON DECEMBER . HOWEVER , AS FROM THAT DATE THE UNITED KINGDOM LEGISLATION WAS TO BE APPLICABLE TO HIM .   ON THE BASIS OF THAT AGREEMENT MR BRUSSE ' S EMPLOYER ASKED THE RAAD VAN ARBEID , AMSTERDAM , TO AWARD MR BRUSSE THE FAMILY ALLOWANCES PAYABLE TO HIM UNDER NETHERLANDS LEGISLATION FOR THE PERIOD IN RESPECT OF WHICH IT HAD BEEN AGREED THAT THAT LEGISLATION WOULD APPLY TO HIM .   THE RAAD VAN ARBEID REJECTED THAT REQUEST , CONTENDING THAT THE NETHERLANDS LEGISLATION PROVIDES FOR PAYMENT OF FAMILY ALLOWANCES ONLY TO WORKERS RESIDING IN THE NETHERLANDS AND THAT MR BRUSSE DID NOT FULFIL THAT CONDITION DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD . IN ADDITION THE RAAD VAN ARBEID DENIED THAT THE AGREEMENT CONCERNING MR BRUSSE WAS AN AGREEMENT WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1408/.    MR BRUSSE CHALLENGED THAT DECISION BEFORE THE RAAD VAN BEROEP ( SOCIAL SECURITY COURT ), AMSTERDAM , WHICH UPHELD HIS RIGHT TO THE FAMILY ALLOWANCES IN QUESTION . THE RAAD VAN ARBEID APPEALED AGAINST THAT DECISION TO THE CENTRALE RAAD VAN BEROEP . THAT COURT DECIDED TO STAY THE PROCEEDINGS AND TO REFER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS TO THE COURT :    ' ' . DOES ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1408/ENABLE TWO MEMBER STATES , IN THE CASE WHERE A WORKER OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS WAS NOT AFFILIATED TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEME OF ONE OF THOSE MEMBER STATES WHICH WAS APPLICABLE TO HIM PURSUANT TO ARTICLES AND OF REGULATION NO     1408/, TO DECLARE BY AGREEMENT THAT , IN RESPECT OF THOSE YEARS , THE SCHEME OF THE OTHER MEMBER STATE ( WHERE THE EMPLOYEE RESIDED BEFORE MOVING TO THE FIRST MEMBER STATE ) IS APPLICABLE?    2.IF THE REPLY TO THE FIRST QUESTION IS IN THE AFFIRMATIVE ( AND ASSUMING THAT THE COURT OF JUSTICE HAS JURISDICTION TO PRONOUNCE BY WAY OF A PRELIMINARY RULING UPON THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN TWO MEMBER STATES MENTIONED IN THE FIRST QUESTION ) IS THE WORKER CONCERNED ENTITLED TO FAMILY ALLOWANCES UNDER THE SCHEME OF A MEMBER STATE INDICATED IN THAT AGREEMENT EVEN IF HE DOES NOT SATISFY THE CONDITION FOR ENTITLEMENT TO FAMILY ALLOWANCES LAID DOWN IN THAT SCHEME , NAMELY RESIDENCE IN THE TERRITORY OF THAT MEMBER STATES?  ' '  THE COURT ' S JURISDICTION    IN THE SECOND QUESTION THE CENTRALE RAAD VAN BEROEP EXPRESSES DOUBTS , PARENTHETICALLY , AS TO THE COURT ' S JURISDICTION TO PRONOUNCE BY WAY OF A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE TREATY UPON AN AGREEMENT MADE BETWEEN TWO MEMBER STATES UNDER ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1408/.    THERE IS NO NEED TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE COURT MAY , UNDER ARTICLE OF THE TREATY , PRONOUNCE ON THE VALIDITY OR INTERPRETATION OF SUCH AN AGREEMENT SINCE IT HAS JURISDICTION , IN ANY EVENT , TO DEFINE THE SCOPE OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1408/SO AS TO ENABLE THE NATIONAL COURT TO GIVE JUDGMENT IN THE CASE BEFORE IT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMMUNITY RULES .  THE FIRST QUESTION   THE CENTRALE RAAD VAN BEROEP ' S FIRST QUESTION SEEKS , ESSENTIALLY , TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER TWO MEMBER STATES MAY , BY MEANS OF AN AGREEMENT CONCLUDED UNDER ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1408/, DECIDE , WITH RETROACTIVE EFFECT , THAT THE LEGISLATION OF ONE OF THOSE MEMBER STATES , WHICH IS APPLICABLE TO A WORKER PURSUANT TO ARTICLES TO , DOES NOT APPLY TO HIM AND THAT THE LEGISLATION OF THE OTHER STATE IS APPLICABLE TO HIM IN RESPECT OF A GIVEN PERIOD .       BEFORE A REPLY IS GIVEN TO THAT QUESTION , ARTICLE MUST BE PLACED IN ITS LEGAL CONTEXT .   AS THE COURT HAS RECENTLY POINTED OUT ( JUDGMENT OF SEPTEMBER IN CASE 276/BOARD OF THE SOCIALE VERZEKERINGSBANK V HEIRS OR ASSIGNS OF G . T . KUIJPERS ( ) ECR ) THE AIM OF THE PROVISIONS OF TITLE II OF REGULATION NO 1408/, WHICH DETERMINE THE LEGISLATION APPLICABLE TO WORKERS MOVING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY , ' ' IS TO ENSURE THAT THE PERSONS CONCERNED SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEME OF ONLY ONE MEMBER STATE , IN ORDER TO PREVENT MORE THAN ONE NATIONAL LEGISLATION FROM BEING APPLICABLE AND THE COMPLICATIONS WHICH MAY RESULT FROM THAT SITUATION ' ' .   IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT AIM ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) LAYS DOWN THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE THAT A WORKER IS TO BE SUBJECT , WITH REGARD TO SOCIAL SECURITY MATTERS , TO THE LEGISLATION OF THE MEMBER STATE IN WHOSE TERRITORY HE IS EMPLOYED .   NEVERTHELESS THAT GENERAL PRINCIPLE IS STATED TO BE ' ' SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES TO ' ' . IN FACT , IN CERTAIN SPECIFIC SITUATIONS THE UNRESERVED APPLICATION OF THE RULE SET OUT IN ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) MIGHT CREATE , INSTEAD OF PREVENT , ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLICATIONS FOR WORKERS AS WELL AS FOR EMPLOYERS AND SOCIAL SECURITY AUTHORITIES , WHICH WOULD ENTAIL DELAYS IN THE FORWARDING OF EMPLOYEES '  FILES AND , THEREFORE , PLACE OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF THEIR FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT . SPECIAL RULES GOVERNING SUCH SITUATIONS ARE SET OUT IN ARTICLES TO .    IN ADDITION , ARTICLE ALLOWS EXCEPTIONS TO BE MADE IN ORDER TO COVER OTHER SITUATIONS WHICH , ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED FOR IN TITLE II OF REGULATION NO 1408/, CALL FOR A SOLUTION WHICH DIFFERS FROM THOSE ADOPTED IN ARTICLES TO . THE TASK OF IDENTIFYING THOSE SITUATIONS AND DETERMINING THE LEGISLATION TO BE APPLIED IS ENTRUSTED BY ARTICLE TO THE MEMBER STATES CONCERNED , WHICH MAY , BY COMMON AGREEMENT , DEROGATE FROM ARTICLES TO PROVIDED THE AGREEMENT IS CONCLUDED ' ' IN THE INTEREST OF CERTAIN WORKERS ' ' .   CONSEQUENTLY , IT IS WHOLLY CONSISTENT WITH THE SCHEME OF REGULATION NO 1408/, AND IN PARTICULAR WITH ARTICLE THEREOF , FOR TWO MEMBER STATES TO     CONCLUDE AN AGREEMENT WITH A VIEW TO SUBJECTING A WORKER TO LEGISLATION OTHER THAN THAT DESIGNATED IN ARTICLES TO , PROVIDED THAT THE AGREEMENT IS IN THE INTERESTS OF THAT WORKER .   THE NATIONAL COURT HAS EXPRESSED DOUBTS AS TO WHETHER SUCH A DEROGATION MIGHT BE GIVEN RETROACTIVE EFFECT , THAT IS TO SAY WHETHER THE LEGISLATION DESIGNATED BY THE MEMBER STATES IN DEROGATION FROM ARTICLES TO MAY BE REGARDED AS APPLICABLE IN RESPECT OF PAST PERIODS .   THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORDING OF ARTICLE TO INDICATE THAT RECOURSE TO THE DEROGATION MADE AVAILABLE TO THE MEMBER STATES BY THAT PROVISION IS POSSIBLE ONLY AS REGARDS THE FUTURE .   ON THE CONTRARY , IT FOLLOWS FROM THE SPIRIT AND SCHEME OF ARTICLE THAT AN AGREEMENT WITHIN THE MEANING OF THAT PROVISION MUST ALSO BE CAPABLE , IN THE INTERESTS OF THE WORKER OR WORKERS CONCERNED , OF COVERING PAST PERIODS . SINCE ARTICLE PROVIDES FOR AN EXCEPTION INTENDED TO MITIGATE THE DIFFICULTIES RESULTING FROM THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLES TO TO SPECIAL SITUATIONS NOT SPECIFICALLY ENVISAGED IN REGULATION NO 1408/, IT MAY BE USED NOT ONLY TO ENSURE THAT A CERTAIN SITUATION DOES NOT ARISE BUT ALSO TO REMEDY AN EXISTING SITUATION THE INJUSTICE OF WHICH APPEARS ONLY AFTER IT HAS ARISEN .   IT MUST ALSO BE EMPHASIZED THAT , IN VIEW OF THE TIME NEEDED FOR TWO OR MORE MEMBER STATES TO REACH AGREEMENT AS TO WHETHER IT IS APPROPRIATE TO DEROGATE FROM ARTICLES TO , ARTICLE WOULD BE DEPRIVED OF MUCH OF ITS MEANING IF THE AGREEMENT COULD HAVE ONLY PROSPECTIVE EFFECT .   IT MUST THEREFORE BE CONCLUDED THAT AN AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BETWEEN TWO OR MORE MEMBER STATES PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1408/MAY DECLARE LEGISLATION OTHER THAN THAT DESIGNATED IN ARTICLES TO APPLICABLE IN RESPECT OF PAST PERIODS PROVIDED , OF COURSE , THAT THE AGREEMENT IS IN THE INTERESTS OF THE WORKER OR WORKERS IN QUESTION .       IN ITS OBSERVATIONS SUBMITTED TO THE COURT THE RAAD VAN ARBEID MAINTAINS THAT MEMBER STATES MAY NOT AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THEIR RIGHT TO DEROGATE FROM ARTICLES TO IN A CASE SUCH AS THIS WHERE THE WORKER IN QUESTION HAS FAILED TO AFFILIATE HIMSELF TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEME DESIGNATED IN ARTICLE ( ) ( A ).   NO SUCH RESTRICTION ON THE POWER CONFERRED UPON THE MEMBER STATES APPEARS ANYWHERE IN ARTICLE . ON THE CONTRARY , THAT PROVISION MAKES NO REFERENCE TO THE REASONS OR CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MIGHT LEAD THE MEMBER STATES TO DEROGATE FROM ARTICLES TO . IT FOLLOWS THAT , IN THAT RESPECT , THE MEMBER STATES ENJOY A WIDE DISCRETION TO WHICH THE ONLY LIMITATION IS REGARD FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE WORKER .   CONSEQUENTLY THE REPLY TO THE FIRST QUESTION MUST BE THAT ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1408/MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR TWO MEMBER STATES , IN THE CASE OF A WORKER WHO FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF YEARS HAS NOT BEEN AFFILIATED TO THE SCHEME OF ONE OF THOSE MEMBER STATES WHICH WAS APPLICABLE TO HIM PURSUANT TO ARTICLES TO INCLUSIVE OF THE SAID REGULATION , BY AGREEMENT TO DECLARE APPLICABLE , IN RESPECT OF THOSE YEARS , THE LEGISLATION OF THE OTHER MEMBER STATE PROVIDED THAT SUCH AGREEMENT CORRESPONDS TO THE INTERESTS OF THE WORKER CONCERNED .  THE SECOND QUESTION   THE CENTRALE RAAD VAN BEROEP ' S SECOND QUESTION SEEKS TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER A WORKER , TO WHOM THE LEGISLATION OF A MEMBER STATE OTHER THAN THE STATE IN WHICH HE AND HIS FAMILY RESIDE HAS BEEN MADE APPLICABLE BY MEANS OF AN AGREEMENT CONCLUDED UNDER ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1408/, IS ENTITLED TO BE GRANTED THE FAMILY ALLOWANCES PROVIDED FOR BY THAT LEGISLATION EVEN IF THAT LEGISLATION LIMITS THE GRANT OF SUCH ALLOWANCES TO PERSONS RESIDING IN THE TERRITORY OF THE MEMBER STATE IN QUESTION .   IN THE FIRST PLACE IT SHOULD BE STATED THAT THE REPLY TO BE GIVEN TO THAT QUESTION DOES NOT DEPEND ON ARTICLES TO OF REGULATION NO 1408/, WHOSE SOLE PURPOSE IS TO ENABLE THE LEGISLATION APPLICABLE TO VARIOUS WORKERS MOVING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY TO BE DETERMINED , BUT RATHER ON THE PROVISIONS     OF NATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE BY VIRTUE OF ARTICLES TO , PROVIDED , HOWEVER , THAT THOSE PROVISIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE RELEVANT RULES OF COMMUNITY LAW .   WITH REGARD TO ENTITLEMENT TO FAMILY ALLOWANCES , THEREFORE , IT IS NECESSARY TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1408/WHICH STATES THAT :    ' ' A WORKER SUBJECT TO THE LEGISLATION OF A MEMBER STATE OTHER THAN FRANCE SHALL BE ENTITLED TO FAMILY BENEFITS PROVIDED FOR BY THE LEGISLATION OF THE FIRST MEMBER STATE FOR MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY RESIDING IN THE TERRITORY OF ANOTHER MEMBER STATE , AS THOUGH THEY WERE RESIDING IN THE TERRITORY OF THE FIRST STATE . ' '   THAT ARTICLE CREATES , IN FAVOUR OF A WORKER WHO , AS IN THE CASE ENVISAGED IN THE ORDER MAKING THE REFERENCE , IS SUBJECT TO THE LEGISLATION OF A MEMBER STATE OTHER THAN THE STATE IN WHOSE TERRITORY THE MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY RESIDE , A REAL ENTITLEMENT TO THE FAMILY ALLOWANCES PROVIDED FOR BY THE APPLICABLE LEGISLATION . THAT ENTITLEMENT CANNOT BE DEFEATED BY THE APPLICATION OF A PROVISION OF THAT LEGISLATION BY VIRTUE OF WHICH PERSONS NOT RESIDING IN THE TERRITORY OF THE MEMBER STATE IN QUESTION ARE NOT TO RECEIVE FAMILY ALLOWANCES .   IT MUST ALSO BE ADDED IN CONNECTION WITH ARTICLE THAT IT IS IRRELEVANT WHETHER THE LEGISLATION TO WHICH THE WORKER IS SUBJECT WAS DETERMINED BY APPLICATION OF ARTICLES TO OF REGULATION NO 1408/OR ON THE BASIS OF AN AGREEMENT CONCLUDED PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THAT REGULATION .   CONSEQUENTLY THE REPLY TO THE SECOND QUESTION MUST BE THAT A WORKER WHO HAS BEEN SUBJECT , ON THE BASIS OF AN AGREEMENT CONCLUDED UNDER THE TERMS OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1408/, TO THE LEGISLATION OF A MEMBER STATE OTHER THAN THE ONE IN WHICH THE MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY RESIDE IS ENTITLED , UNDER ARTICLE OF THE SAID REGULATION , TO FAMILY BENEFITS PROVIDED FOR BY THE LEGISLATION DESIGNATED BY THAT AGREEMENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT HE DOES NOT SATISFY THE TERMS OF A PROVISION AS TO RESIDENCE CONTAINED IN THAT LEGISLATION .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE NETHERLANDS , BY THE UNITED KINGDOM AND BY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , WHICH HAVE     SUBMITTED OBSERVATIONS TO THE COURT , ARE NOT RECOVERABLE . AS THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE , IN SO FAR AS THE PARTIES TO THE MAIN ACTION ARE CONCERNED , IN THE NATURE OF A STEP IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THE NATIONAL COURT , THE DECISION ON COSTS IS A MATTER FOR THAT COURT .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ( FIRST CHAMBER )   IN ANSWER TO THE QUESTIONS REFERRED TO IT BY THE CENTRALE RAAD VAN BEROEP BY ORDER OF OCTOBER , HEREBY RULES :   . ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1408/MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR TWO MEMBER STATES , IN THE CASE OF A WORKER WHO FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF YEARS HAS NOT BEEN AFFILIATED TO THE SCHEME OF ONE OF THOSE MEMBER STATES WHICH WAS APPLICABLE TO HIM PURSUANT TO ARTICLES TO INCLUSIVE OF THE SAID REGULATION , BY AGREEMENT TO DECLARE APPLICABLE , IN RESPECT OF THOSE YEARS , THE LEGISLATION OF THE OTHER MEMBER STATE PROVIDED THAT SUCH AGREEMENT CORRESPONDS TO THE INTERESTS OF THE WORKER CONCERNED ;  2.A WORKER WHO HAS BEEN SUBJECT , ON THE BASIS OF AN AGREEMENT CONCLUDED UNDER THE TERMS OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1408/, TO THE LEGISLATION OF A MEMBER STATE OTHER THAN THE ONE IN WHICH THE MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY RESIDE IS ENTITLED , BY VIRTUE OF ARTICLE OF THE SAID REGULATION , TO FAMILY BENEFITS PROVIDED FOR BY THE LEGISLATION DESIGNATED BY THAT AGREEMENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT HE DOES NOT SATISFY THE TERMS OF A PROVISION AS TO RESIDENCE CONTAINED IN THAT LEGISLATION .
