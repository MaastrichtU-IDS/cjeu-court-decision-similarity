IN THE VERSION IN FORCE UNTIL THE END OF , ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS PROVIDED THAT : ' ' AN OFFICIAL ' S REMUNERATION SHALL BE EXPRESSED IN BELGIAN FRANCS . IT SHALL BE PAID IN THE CURRENCY OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THE OFFICIAL PERFORMS HIS DUTIES . REMUNERATION PAID IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN BELGIAN FRANCS SHALL BE CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF THE PAR VALUES ACCEPTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND ON JANUARY . AN OFFICIAL ' S REMUNERATION EXPRESSED IN BELGIAN FRANCS SHALL . . . BE WEIGHTED AT A RATE ABOVE , BELOW OR EQUAL TO 100% DEPENDING ON LIVING CONDITIONS IN THE VARIOUS PLACES OF EMPLOYMENT . . . THE WEIGHTING APPLICABLE TO THE REMUNERATION OF OFFICIALS EMPLOYED AT THE PROVISIONAL SEATS OF THE COMMUNITIES SHALL BE EQUAL TO 100% AS AT JANUARY . ' '   ON DECEMBER THE COUNCIL ADOPTED REGULATION ( EURATOM , ECSC , EEC ) NO 3085/( OFFICIAL JOURNAL L , P . ). ARTICLE THEREOF PROVIDES THAT ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS IS TO BE REPLACED BY THE FOLLOWING PROVISION :    ' ' OFFICIALS '  REMUNERATION SHALL BE EXPRESSED IN BELGIAN FRANCS . IT SHALL BE PAID IN THE CURRENCY OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THE OFFICIAL PERFORMS HIS DUTIES .  REMUNERATION PAID IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN BELGIAN FRANCS SHALL BE CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF THE EXCHANGE RATES USED FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GENERAL BUDGET OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ON JULY .       THIS DATE SHALL BE CHANGED , AT THE TIME OF THE ANNUAL REVIEW OF REMUNERATION PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE , BY THE COUNCIL ACTING BY A QUALIFIED MAJORITY UPON A PROPOSAL FROM THE COMMISSION AS PROVIDED IN THE FIRST INDENT OF THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLES ( ) OF THE EEC TREATY AND OF ( ) OF THE EURATOM TREATY .  WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLES AND , THE WEIGHTINGS FIXED PURSUANT TO THESE ARTICLES SHALL , WHENEVER THE ABOVE DATE IS CHANGED , BE ADJUSTED BY THE COUNCIL , WHICH , ACTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURE MENTIONED IN THE THIRD PARAGRAPH , SHALL CORRECT THE EFFECT OF THE VARIATION IN THE BELGIAN FRANC WITH RESPECT TO THE RATES REFERRED TO IN THE SECOND PARAGRAPH . ' '  ARTICLE OF THE REGULATIONS PROVIDES THAT THE REGULATION IS TO ENTER INTO FORCE ON JANUARY AND THAT IT IS TO APPLY FROM APRIL .    ON DECEMBER THE COUNCIL ALSO ADOPTED REGULATION ( EURATOM , ECSC , EEC ) NO 3086/ADJUSTING THE WEIGHTINGS APPLICABLE TO THE REMUNERATION AND PENSIONS OF OFFICIALS AND OTHER SERVANTS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES FOLLOWING THE AMENDMENT OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS CONCERNING THE MONETARY PARITIES TO BE USED IN IMPLEMENTING THE STAFF REGULATIONS . ARTICLE ( ) OF THE REGULATION FIXES AMONGST OTHER THINGS THE WEIGHTING APPLICABLE TO THE REMUNERATION OF OFFICIALS AND OTHER SERVANTS .   THE RULES IN FORCE BEFORE JANUARY PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS PROVIDED FOR A SO-CALLED ' ' SEPARATION ' '  ALLOWANCE EQUAL TO 20% OF THE BASIC SALARY TO BE PAID TO OFFICIALS WHO COULD PROVE THAT THEIR PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT WAS MORE THAN KILOMETRES ( KILOMETRES UNDER THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY OF ) FROM THEIR PLACE OF ORIGIN . NATIONALITY WAS NOT TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION .   THE STAFF REGULATIONS WHICH ENTERED INTO FORCE ON JANUARY REPLACED THAT ALLOWANCE BY THE ' ' EXPATRIATION ' '  ALLOWANCE , SO-CALLED BECAUSE AN OFFICIAL HAS TO WORK IN A MEMBER STATE OTHER THAN THAT OF WHICH HE IS A NATIONAL . AS A TRANSITIONAL PROVISION ARTICLE PROVIDED THAT :       ' ' ANY OFFICIAL IN RECEIPT OF A SEPARATION ALLOWANCE BEFORE THESE REGULATIONS WERE APPLIED WHO DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR AN EXPATRIATION ALLOWANCE UNDER ARTICLE OF ANNEX VII SHALL BE ALLOWED THE SAME AMOUNT AS THAT WHICH HE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED BY WAY OF SEPARATION ALLOWANCE UNDER THE SCALE OF REMUNERATION EXISTING BEFORE THE STAFF REGULATIONS ENTERED INTO FORCE . SUCH AMOUNT SHALL NOT IN FUTURE BE VARIED FOR ANY REASON WHATEVER , SAVE WHERE THE OFFICIAL QUALIFIES FOR AN EXPATRIATION ALLOWANCE BY SATISFYING THE REQUIREMENTS THEREFOR . ' '   ARTICLE WAS APPLIED AFTER MAY AND WITH RETROACTIVE EFFECT FROM FEBRUARY TO OFFICIALS WHO HAD BEEN RECRUITED BETWEEN JUNE AND DECEMBER BY THE FORMER COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN ATOMIC ENERGY COMMUNITY AND HAD NEVER RECEIVED THE SEPARATION ALLOWANCE . BY LETTER OF MARCH OFFICIALS IN THAT CATEGORY BELONGING TO THE JOINT RESEARCH CENTRE WERE SENT A CIRCULAR IN WHICH THE AMOUNT OF THE SEPARATION ALLOWANCE WAS EXPRESSED IN BELGIAN FRANCS ON THE BASIS OF THE BASIC SALARY , LIKEWISE EXPRESSED IN BELGIAN FRANCS , SHOWN IN THEIR LETTERS OF EMPLOYMENT .   THE ALLOWANCE IN QUESTION CONTINUED TO BE PAID TO OFFICIALS ON THE BASIS OF THE EXCHANGE RATE OF BELGIAN FRANC TO 12.ITALIAN LIRE . ACCORDING TO THE APPLICANT AN ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION TAKEN IN JANUARY BUT WHICH WAS NEVER BROUGHT TO THE NOTICE OF THE STAFF , PROVIDED FOR THAT ALLOWANCE , AMONGST OTHERS , TO BE PAID ON THE BASIS OF UPDATED EXCHANGE RATES . HOWEVER , THAT DECISION WAS NEVER APPLIED TO THE SEPARATION ALLOWANCE BECAUSE , ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSION , AFTER A CHECK OF THE VARIOUS BUDGETARY ITEMS IT CONSIDERED THAT THE DECISION SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO THAT ALLOWANCE ON THE GROUND THAT ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS PROVIDES THAT IT MAY NOT BE VARIED FOR ANY REASON WHATEVER .   AFTER THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF REGULATIONS NOS AND 3086/THE APPLICANT FOUND THAT IN HIS SALARY STATEMENT FOR APRIL THE AMOUNT EXPRESSED IN BELGIAN FRANCS WAS CONSIDERABLY REDUCED WHILST THAT PAID IN ITALIAN LIRE REMAINED UNCHANGED .   BY LETTER OF JUNE HE CONSEQUENTLY SUBMITTED TO THE COMMISSION A COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AGAINST THE ' ' REDUCTION IN REAL TERMS ' '  OF THE ALLOWANCE . HE COMPLAINED NOT ONLY OF THE     REDUCTION OF THE AMOUNT IN BELGIAN FRANCS WHICH WAS APPARENT FROM HIS SALARY STATEMENT FOR APRIL BUT ALSO OF THE NON-APPLICATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION OF . THE COMMISSION REJECTED THAT COMPLAINT AND THE APPLICANT BROUGHT THIS APPLICATION .   THE APPLICANT ' S MAIN CLAIM , RELATING TO THE PERIOD BEGINNING ON APRIL , SHOULD BE EXAMINED FIRST . HE MAINTAINS THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE SEPARATION ALLOWANCE SHOULD BE PAID AT THE UPDATED EXCHANGE RATE FROM APRIL . THAT , HE CLAIMS , FOLLOWS FROM ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AS IT NOW STANDS . THE COMMISSION CONTESTS THAT ARGUMENT . IT MAINTAINS THAT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AN OFFICIAL MAY RECEIVE ONLY THE AMOUNT WHICH HE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED BY WAY OF SEPARATION ALLOWANCE UNDER THE SCALE OF REMUNERATION EXISTING PRIOR TO THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS . THAT AMOUNT MAY NOT IN FUTURE BE VARIED FOR ANY REASON WHATEVER . IT FOLLOWS THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE IN THE NATIONAL CURRENCY OF THE PLACE WHERE OFFICIALS ARE EMPLOYED WAS FIXED BY APPLYING THE EXCHANGE RATE IN AND THAT THIS AMOUNT MAY NOT BE CHANGED .   THE COMMISSION ' S ARGUMENT CANNOT BE ACCEPTED . IT IS COMMON GROUND THAT OFFICIALS '  REMUNERATION WAS EXPRESSED IN BELGIAN FRANCS BEFORE THE STAFF REGULATIONS WERE ADOPTED AND THEREAFTER THE AMOUNT OF REMUNERATION OF EACH OFFICIAL HAS BEEN FIXED IN BELGIAN FRANCS , EVEN IF THE REMUNERATION IS PAID IN NATIONAL CURRENCY . ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS MUST THEREFORE BE UNDERSTOOD AS MEANING THAT IT ENTITLES AN OFFICIAL TO RECEIVE A SEPARATION ALLOWANCE THE AMOUNT OF WHICH , EXPRESSED IN BELGIAN FRANCS , HAS BEEN FROZEN AT THE LEVEL . THAT AMOUNT MUST BE CALCULATED IN THE NATIONAL CURRENCY OF THE PLACE WHERE AN OFFICIAL IS EMPLOYED AT THE RATE FIXED IN ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS AS IN FORCE WHEN THE ALLOWANCE HAS TO BE PAID .   IT FOLLOWS THAT THE APPLICANT IS ENTITLED TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMOUNT PAID TO HIM BY THE COMMISSION AFTER APRIL BY WAY OF SEPARATION ALLOWANCE AND THE AMOUNT WHICH WOULD BE OBTAINED FROM THE APPLICATION OF THE UPDATED EXCHANGE RATE AND TO THAT EXTENT THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION MUST BE ANNULLED .       THE SEPARATION ALLOWANCE , TO WHICH THE WEIGHTING REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS HAS NEVER BEEN APPLIED , MUST NOT BE WEIGHTED EITHER AFTER THE ADOPTION OF THE UPDATED RATES .   AS TO THE APPLICANT ' S CLAIM FOR A RULING THAT UPDATED EXCHANGE RATES MUST BE APPLIED TO THE ALLOWANCE DURING THE PERIOD FROM JANUARY TO MARCH , A STUDY OF THE FILE ON THE CASE LEADS TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION .   ON NOVEMBER THE COMMISSION TOOK THE DECISION TO APPLY AS FROM NOVEMBER UPDATED EXCHANGE RATES TO THE REFUND OF CERTAIN EXPENSES INCURRED BY OFFICIALS OF THE COMMISSION . THAT DECISION DID NOT CONCERN THE SEPARATION ALLOWANCE . BY AN INTERNAL INSTRUCTION FROM THE DIRECTOR OF PERSONNEL , WHICH WAS APPROVED ON JANUARY BY THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL FOR PERSONNEL AND ADMINISTRATION , THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION WAS EXTENDED AS FROM JANUARY ' ' TO ALL EMOLUMENTS PAID BY THE COMMISSION OR TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO PAY AN AMOUNT ON THE BASIS OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS OR THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OTHER SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES , WHERE THOSE AMOUNTS ARE NOT WEIGHTED UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS ' '  EXCEPT FOR SOME SPECIFIC AMOUNTS EXPRESSLY REFERRED TO IN THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF THE INSTRUCTION .   FOLLOWING THAT INSTRUCTION THE OFFICERS OF THE COMMISSION DREW UP A LIST OF THE BUDGETARY ITEMS TO WHICH IT HAD TO BE APPLIED . AMONGST THOSE ITEMS THERE WAS MENTION OF ALLOWANCES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ART . , ART . , ECSC STAFF REGULATIONS . SHORTLY AFTERWARDS , AT ANY RATE BEFORE PAYMENTS WERE ACTUALLY MADE PURSUANT TO THE INSTRUCTION , A CHECK WAS CARRIED OUT ON THE VARIOUS ITEMS COMPRISED IN THAT LIST . IT WAS ASCERTAINED THAT THE SEPARATION ALLOWANCE WAS GOVERNED BY ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS WITH THE RESULT THAT THE INSTRUCTION WAS NEVER APPLIED WITH RESPECT TO THAT ALLOWANCE .   IT IS COMMON GROUND THAT WHATEVER ITS LEGAL VALUE MAY BE THE INSTRUCTION WAS NEVER BROUGHT TO THE NOTICE OF STAFF , WHICH THE APPLICANT HIMSELF ACCEPTS . IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE MADE HIS COMPLAINT ON JUNE THAT HE FIRST ASKED FOR UPDATED EXCHANGE RATES TO BE APPLIED IN RESPECT OF THE PERIOD PRIOR TO APRIL .        IT FOLLOWS FROM THE CONSIDERATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE THAT THE ALLOWANCE IN QUESTION MUST BE REGARDED AS AN AMOUNT EXPRESSED IN BELGIAN FRANCS , BUT WHICH , PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , MUST BE PAID IN THE NATIONAL CURRENCY OF THE PLACE AT WHICH AN OFFICIAL IS EMPLOYED AT THE RATE APPLYING ON THE DATE ON WHICH THE ALLOWANCE HAS TO BE PAID . THE COMMISSION THEREFORE RIGHTLY DECIDED TO APPLY UNTIL APRIL THE EXCHANGE RATE REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE OF THE OLD VERSION OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS . IT FOLLOWS THAT IN SO FAR AS THE APPLICANT ' S CLAIM RELATES TO THE PERIOD PRIOR TO APRIL IT MUST BE DISMISSED .
