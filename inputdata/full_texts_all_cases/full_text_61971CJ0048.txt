Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAD FAILED TO FULFIL THE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED ON IT BY THE TREATY ESTABLISHING THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY AND IN PARTICULAR BY ARTICLE BY NOT COMPLYING WITH THE JUDGMENT GIVEN ON DECEMBER BY THE COURT OF JUSTICE IN CASE 7/68, COMMISSION OF THE EC V ITALIAN REPUBLIC ( ) ECR 423, 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION DATED JULY THE COMMISSION HAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE TREATY AN APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC BY NOT COMPLYING WITH THE JUDGMENT GIVEN ON DECEMBER IN CASE 7/HAS FAILED TO FULFIL THE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED ON IT BY ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY .  IN THIS JUDGMENT THE COURT HAD DECLARED THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC, BY CONTINUING TO LEVY AFTER JANUARY THE PROGRESSIVE TAX LAID DOWN BY ARTICLE OF THE LAW OF JUNE NO ON THE EXPORT TO OTHER MEMBER STATES OF THE COMMUNITY OF ARTICLES OF AN ARTISTIC, HISTORIC, ARCHAEOLOGICAL OR ETHNOGRAPHIC INTEREST, HAD FAILED TO FULFIL THE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED ON IT BY ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY .  THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC, WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT IT IS BOUND TO TAKE MEASURES TO COMPLY WITH THIS JUDGMENT, CITES THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH IT MET WITH IN REGARD TO PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE AIMED AT ABOLISHING THE TAX AND REFORMING THE SYSTEM OF PROTECTION OF THE NATIONAL ARTISTIC HERITAGE . THESE MEASURES MUST NECESSARILY BE ADOPTED IN THE FORM AND ACCORDING TO THE PROCEDURES PROVIDED FOR BY ITS CONSTITUTIONAL LAW . SINCE THE LEVYING OF THE TAX CAN CEASE ONLY ON ITS FORMAL REPEAL AND SINCE THE DELAYS IN EFFECTING THIS REPEAL ARE DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF THE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES, THERE ARE NO GROUNDS FOR FINDING A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .  THE COMMISSION MAINTAINS THAT THE NATIONAL PROVISIONS COULD HAVE BEEN REPEALED BY MORE EXPEDITIOUS MEANS .  WITHOUT HAVING TO EXAMINE THE VALIDITY OF SUCH ARGUMENTS, IT SUFFICES FOR THE COURT TO OBSERVE THAT BY JUDGMENT OF DECEMBER IT ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE THE QUESTION IN DISPUTE BETWEEN THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE COMMISSION : WHETHER OR NOT THE TAX IN QUESTION WAS TO BE REGARDED AS A TAX HAVING AN EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO A CUSTOMS DUTY ON EXPORTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .  FURTHER BY ANOTHER JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER GIVEN IN CASE 18/71, EUNOMIA V ITALIAN REPUBLIC, THE COURT EXPRESSLY FOUND THAT THE PROHIBITION CONTAINED IN ARTICLE PRODUCES DIRECT EFFECTS IN THE NATIONAL LAW OF ALL MEMBER STATES .  SINCE IT IS A QUESTION OF A DIRECTLY APPLICABLE COMMUNITY RULE, THE ARGUMENT THAT THE INFRINGEMENT CAN BE TERMINATED ONLY BY THE ADOPTION OF MEASURES CONSTITUTIONALLY APPROPRIATE TO REPEAL THE PROVISION ESTABLISHING THE TAX WOULD AMOUNT TO SAYING THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE COMMUNITY RULE IS SUBJECT TO THE LAW OF EACH MEMBER STATE AND MORE PRECISELY THAT THIS APPLICATION IS IMPOSSIBLE WHERE IT IS CONTRARY TO A NATIONAL LAW .  IN THE PRESENT CASE THE EFFECT OF COMMUNITY LAW, DECLARED AS RES JUDICATA IN RESPECT OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC, IS A PROHIBITION HAVING THE FULL FORCE OF LAW ON THE COMPETENT NATIONAL AUTHORITIES AGAINST APPLYING A NATIONAL RULE RECOGNIZED AS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE TREATY AND, IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES SO REQUIRE, AN OBLIGATION ON THEM TO TAKE ALL APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO ENABLE COMMUNITY LAW TO BE FULLY APPLIED .  THE ATTAINMENT OF THE OBJECTIVES OF THE COMMUNITY REQUIRES THAT THE RULES OF COMMUNITY LAW ESTABLISHED BY THE TREATY ITSELF OR ARISING FROM PROCEDURES WHICH IT HAS INSTITUTED ARE FULLY APPLICABLE AT THE SAME TIME AND WITH IDENTICAL EFFECTS OVER THE WHOLE TERRITORY OF THE COMMUNITY WITHOUT THE MEMBER STATES BEING ABLE TO PLACE ANY OBSTACLES IN THE WAY .  THE GRANT MADE BY MEMBER STATES TO THE COMMUNITY OF RIGHTS AND POWERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY INVOLVES A DEFINITIVE LIMITATION ON THEIR SOVEREIGN RIGHTS AND NO PROVISIONS WHATSOEVER OF NATIONAL LAW MAY BE INVOKED TO OVERRIDE THIS LIMITATION .  IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO FIND THAT IN NOT COMPLYING WITH THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF DECEMBER IN CASE 7/THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL THE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED ON IT BY ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .  IN A COMMUNICATION OF JULY THE DEFENDANT HAS INFORMED THE COURT THAT THE TAX HAS CEASED TO BE LEVIED AND THAT IT HAS BEEN EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED AS FROM JANUARY 1962, THE DATE ON WHICH THE LEVY SHOULD HAVE CEASED .
