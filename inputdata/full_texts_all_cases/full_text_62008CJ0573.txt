Operative part
The Court: 
1.
	Declares that, the legislation transposing Council Directive 79/409/EEC of April on the conservation of wild birds
                     into Italian law not being quite consistent with that directive, and the system for transposing Article of that directive
                     failing to ensure that the derogations adopted by the competent Italian authorities satisfy the conditions and requirements
                     referred to in that article, the Italian Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles to 7, to 11, and of the Directive; 
                  
2.
	Orders the Italian Republic to bear the costs, including those of the interlocutory proceedings.
