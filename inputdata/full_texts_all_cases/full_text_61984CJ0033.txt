IN CASE 33/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE TRIBUNALE CIVILE DI VENEZIA FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE PROCEEDINGS PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  SPA FRAGD  AND  AMMINISTRAZIONE DELLE FINANZE DELLO STATO ( STATE FINANCE ADMINISTRATION )   
Subject of the case
ON THE VALIDITY OF COMMISSION REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1541/OF JUNE ALTERING THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS , 
Grounds
BY ORDER OF NOVEMBER , WHICH WAS RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON FEBRUARY , THE TRIBUNALE CIVILE E PENALE DI VENEZIA ( CIVIL AND CRIMINAL DISTRICT COURT , VENICE ) REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY A QUESTION CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OF COMMISSION REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1541/OF JUNE ALTERING THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ).  THE QUESTION AROSE IN A DISPUTE BETWEEN THE AMMINISTRAZIONE DELLE FINANZE DELLO STATO ( STATE FINANCE ADMINISTRATION ) AND FRAGD SPA , THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS , WHICH PROCESSES QUANTITIES OF MAIZE IN ITALY , FIRST INTO STARCH AND SUBSEQUENTLY INTO POWDERED GLUCOSE ( DEXTROSE ) INTENDED FOR EXPORT . BETWEEN AND JULY THE PLAINTIFF EXPORTED FOUR CONSIGNMENTS OF POWDERED GLUCOSE TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY AND PAID TO THE ITALIAN CUSTOMS AUTHORITY IN RESPECT OF THOSE EXPORTS MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS ON THE BASIS OF THE CRITERIA FIXED BY THE COMMUNITY LEGISLATION IN FORCE AT THAT TIME .  THE PLAINTIFF , RELYING ON THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF OCTOBER IN CASE 145/( ROQUETTE FRERES V FRENCH CUSTOMS ADMINISTRATION ( ) ECR ) AND SECONDLY ON THE ALLEGED ILLEGALITY OF THOSE CRITERIA IN SO FAR AS THEY WERE ESTABLISHED WITH REFERENCE TO THE INTERVENTION PRICE WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE PRODUCTION REFUND ON MAIZE STARCH , INSTITUTED PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE NATIONAL COURT ON MAY AGAINST THE AMMINISTRAZIONE DELLE FINANZE DELLO STATO FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT OF PART OF THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS WHICH IT HAD LEVIED .  THE AMMINISTRAZIONE DELLE FINANZE DELLO STATO , THE DEFENDANT IN THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS , ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS ON THE EXPORTS IN QUESTION WERE CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SAME PROCEDURE AS THAT WHICH WAS DECLARED INVALID BY THE COURT IN ITS JUDGMENT IN ROQUETTE FRERES CONCERNING COMMISSION REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 652/OF MARCH CHANGING THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS FOLLOWING CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES FOR THE FRENCH FRANC ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), BUT CONTESTED THE PLAINTIFF ' S CLAIM AND DENIED THAT THERE WAS ANY RIGHT TO REIMBURSEMENT .  THE NATIONAL COURT POINTS OUT THAT THE ISSUE WHICH ARISES CONCERNS THE DIRECT APPLICATION OF THE RULES LAID DOWN BY REGULATION NO 1541/IN WHICH THE BASES FOR DETERMINING THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS ARE IN REALITY SUCH AS TO MAKE THE PLAINTIFF ' S OBSERVATIONS TO THE EFFECT THAT THE PROVISIONS ARE INVALID ON THE GROUND OF INFRINGEMENT OF COMMUNITY RULES APPEAR TO BE NOT WHOLLY WITHOUT FOUNDATION . THE NATIONAL COURT THEREFORE CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO STAY THE PROCEEDINGS AND TO REFER THE FOLLOWING QUESTION TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING :    ' IS COMMISSION REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1541/OF JUNE VALID IN SO FAR AS IT FIXES THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS FOR THE EXPORTED PRODUCTS IN QUESTION ( POWDERED GLUCOSE OR DEXTROSE CLASSIFIED UNDER COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF SUBHEADING 17.B II ( A )) AT LIT PER TONNE IF , FOR THE PURPOSES OF THAT CALCULATION , REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE INTERVENTION PRICE OF MAIZE WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE PRODUCTION REFUND ON MAIZE STARCH IN ACCORDANCE WITH A CRITERION WHICH THE COURT HAS ALREADY DECLARED INVALID IN ITS JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER IN CASE 145/79?  '  IN THE PLAINTIFF ' S VIEW IT IS NECESSARY TO DISTINGUISH TWO PROBLEMS , FIRST THE PROBLEM OF HOW MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS ARE TO BE CALCULATED AND , SECONDLY , THE QUESTION OF THE LIMITS AND CONSEQUENCES OF A DECLARATION OF INVALIDITY MADE BY THE COURT ON THE BASIS OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY . AS REGARDS THE FIRST PROBLEM , THE PLAINTIFF OBSERVES THAT REGULATION NO 1541/FIXES THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO PRODUCTS PROCESSED FROM MAIZE AND MAIZE STARCH ON THE BASIS OF THE COMMUNITY INTERVENTION PRICE FOR MAIZE , WITHOUT TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE SUBSIDY FOR MAIZE PRODUCTS . CONSEQUENTLY , EXPORTERS OF STARCH AND STARCH PRODUCTS IN COUNTRIES WITH WEAK CURRENCIES , SUCH AS ITALY , HAVE HAD TO PAY MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS APPROXIMATELY 14% LOWER THAN THOSE WHICH WERE ACTUALLY PAID OUT .  AS REGARDS THE QUESTION OF THE LIMITS AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE DECLARATION OF INVALIDITY , THE PLAINTIFF CHALLENGES PARAGRAPH OF THE OPERATIVE PART OF THE AFORESAID JUDGMENT AND CONTENDS THAT IN PRINCIPLE THE COURT ' S TASK IS OVER ONCE IT DECLARES A REGULATION INVALID AND THAT , IN THE CONTEXT OF PROCEEDINGS FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING , ONLY THE NATIONAL COURT HAS JURISDICTION TO GIVE JUDGMENT ON THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CASE AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS MUST BE REIMBURSED . COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1430/OF JULY ON THE REPAYMENT OR REMISSION OF IMPORT OR EXPORT DUTIES ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), WHICH ENTERED INTO FORCE ON JULY , PROVIDES IN ARTICLE , IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE , FOR THE REPAYMENT OF EXPORT DUTIES UPON PROOF THAT THE AMOUNT OF SUCH DUTIES EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT LAWFULLY PAYABLE . FINALLY , THE PLAINTIFF MAINTAINS THAT THE PRINCIPLE THAT SUMS IMPROPERLY LEVIED MUST BE REPAID , WHICH IS AT ISSUE IN THIS CASE , IS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING RELATIONSHIPS GOVERNED BY PRIVATE LAW IN THE ITALIAN LEGAL SYSTEM AS IN ALL THE MEMBER STATES '  LEGAL SYSTEMS ON WHICH COMMUNITY LAW MUST BE BASED .  THE COMMISSION POINTS OUT THAT THE QUESTION SUBMITTED SHOULD REALLY CONCERN COMMISSION REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2140/OF SEPTEMBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) OF WHICH REGULATION NO 1541/IS MERELY AN AMENDED VERSION . REGULATION NO 2140/WHICH , ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSION , IS IN FACT AN AMENDMENT OF REGULATION NO 652/, WAS IN ITS TURN AMENDED BY COMMISSION REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 3013/OF NOVEMBER AMENDING REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2140/AS REGARDS CERTAIN MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS , AND BY REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 2803/AS REGARDS CERTAIN EXPORT REFUNDS IN THE CEREALS SECTOR ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ). IN ADOPTING REGULATION NO 2140/, THE COMMISSION DREW THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE COURT ' S JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER AND THUS IMPLICITLY ACKNOWLEDGED THE INVALIDITY OF THE RULE RELATING TO THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO THE PRODUCT CONCERNED LAID DOWN IN REGULATION NO 2140/. THE COMMISSION ALSO CONSIDERS THAT , SINCE DEXTROSE IS ONE OF THE PRODUCTS REFERRED TO AS ' MAIZE STARCH '  AND ' PRODUCTS OBTAINED BY THE PROCESSING OF . . . MAIZE '  IN PARAGRAPH OF THE OPERATIVE PART OF THE JUDGMENT IN THE ROQUETTE FRERES CASE , AND HAVING REGARD TO PARAGRAPH THEREOF , REGULATION NO 2140/HAS ALREADY BEEN IMPLICITLY DECLARED INVALID BY THAT JUDGMENT .  AS REGARDS THE LIMITS AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE DECLARATION OF INVALIDITY , THE COMMISSION MAINTAINS THAT THE TEMPORAL LIMITATION OF ITS EFFECTS SHOULD NOT AFFECT PERSONS WHO , PRIOR TO THE JUDGMENT DECLARING THE REGULATION INVALID , APPLIED TO THE COURTS OR TO THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT OF MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS UNDULY PAID .  THE QUESTION SUBMITTED TO THE COURT IS DESIGNED TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE PROVISIONS OF REGULATION NO 1541/ARE VALID IN SO FAR AS IT FIXES THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO EXPORTS OF PRODUCTS CLASSIFIED UNDER COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF SUBHEADING 17.B II ( A ) ( POWDERED GLUCOSE ). AS THE COMMISSION RIGHTLY POINTS OUT , THE QUESTION SUBMITTED REALLY CONCERNS COMMISSION REGULATION NO 2140/OF SEPTEMBER , OF WHICH REGULATION NO 1541/CONSTITUTES AN AMENDED VERSION .  IT MUST BE RECALLED IN THIS REGARD THAT , IN ITS JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER , THE COURT HELD IN PARAGRAPH OF THE OPERATIVE PART THAT REGULATION NO 652/WAS INVALID :    ' IN SO FAR AS IT FIXES THE COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO MAIZE STARCH ON A BASIS OTHER THAN THAT OF THE INTERVENTION PRICE OF MAIZE AFTER DEDUCTION OF THE PRODUCTION REFUND ON STARCH ;   . . .  IN SO FAR AS IT FIXES THE COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO ALL THE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS OBTAINED BY THE PROCESSING OF A GIVEN QUANTITY OF THE SAME BASIC PRODUCT , SUCH AS MAIZE OR WHEAT , IN A SPECIFIED MANUFACTURING PROCESS AT A FIGURE APPRECIABLY HIGHER THAN THE COMPENSATORY AMOUNT FIXED FOR THAT GIVEN QUANTITY OF THE BASIC PRODUCT . . . ' .  IN PARAGRAPH OF THE OPERATIVE PART , THE COURT HELD THAT :    ' THE FACT THAT THAT REGULATION IS INVALID RENDERS INVALID THE PROVISIONS OF THE SUBSEQUENT REGULATIONS OF THE COMMISSION , THE PURPOSE OF WHICH IS TO ALTER THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO THE PRODUCTS REFERRED TO IN THE FOREGOING PARAGRAPH . '  AS REGARDS THE FIXING OF THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO THE PRODUCTS CONCERNED , IT IS CLEAR AND UNDISPUTED THAT THE GROUNDS ON WHICH THE REGULATION IN QUESTION WAS DECLARED INVALID IN THE JUDGMENT IN ROQUETTES FRERES ALSO APPLY TO THE PROVISIONS AT ISSUE IN THIS CASE .  REGULATION NO 2140/, AS AMENDED BY REGULATION NO 1541/, REFERS TO REGULATION NO 652/AND , AS THE COMMISSION RIGHTLY POINTS OUT , ALTERS IT IN THE SENSE REQUIRED BY THE OPERATIVE PART OF THE AFORESAID JUDGMENT . IT MUST THEREFORE BE REGARDED AS HAVING BEEN IMPLICITLY DECLARED INVALID BY THAT JUDGMENT .  IT IS THEREFORE SUFFICIENT TO STATE THAT , AS FAR AS CONCERNS THE FIXING OF MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO THE PRODUCT FALLING UNDER SUBHEADING 17.B II ( A ), COMMISSION REGULATION NO 2140/OF SEPTEMBER , AS AMENDED BY COMMISSION REGULATION NO 1541/OF JUNE , IS INVALID ON THE GROUNDS ALREADY STATED BY THE COURT IN ITS JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER .   ALTHOUGH THE QUESTION SUBMITTED IS CONCERNED ONLY WITH WHETHER THE REGULATION IN QUESTION IS INVALID , IT IS APPROPRIATE TO INDICATE THE LIMITS AND CONSEQUENCES OF ITS INVALIDITY , AS THE COURT POINTED OUT IN ITS AFORESAID JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER , IN ORDER TO ENABLE THE NATIONAL COURT TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE BEFORE IT .  IN THAT CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE RECALLED THAT IN PARAGRAPH OF THE OPERATIVE PART OF ITS JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER , THE COURT HELD , FOR THE REASONS STATED IN PARAGRAPHS AND OF THAT DECISION , THAT :    ' THE FACT THAT THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PROVISIONS ARE INVALID DOES NOT ENABLE THE CHARGING OR PAYMENT OF MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS BY THE NATIONAL AUTHORITIES ON THE BASIS OF THOSE PROVISIONS TO BE CHALLENGED AS REGARDS THE PERIOD PRIOR TO THE DATE OF THIS JUDGMENT . '  IT SHOULD BE ADDED THAT THE QUESTION OF THE LIMITS AND CONSEQUENCES OF A DECLARATION THAT , AS A RESULT OF THE JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER , REGULATIONS ALTERING MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS ARE INVALID WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE COURT ' S JUDGMENT OF FEBRUARY IN CASE 112/( SOCIETE DES PRODUITS DE MAIS V DIRECTEUR GENERAL DES DOUANES ET DROITS INDIRECTS ( ) ECR ). IN PARAGRAPH OF THAT JUDGMENT THE COURT EMPHASIZED THAT ITS ' POWER TO IMPOSE TEMPORAL LIMITS ON THE EFFECTS OF A DECLARATION THAT A LEGISLATIVE ACT IS INVALID , IN THE CONTEXT OF PRELIMINARY RULINGS UNDER INDENT ( B ) OF THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE , IS JUSTIFIED BY THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY HAVING REGARD TO THE NECESSARY CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE PRELIMINARY RULING PROCEDURE AND THE ACTION FOR ANNULMENT PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLES , AND OF THE TREATY , WHICH ARE TWO MECHANISMS PROVIDED BY THE TREATY FOR REVIEWING THE LEGALITY OF ACTS OF THE COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS . THE POSSIBILITY OF IMPOSING TEMPORAL LIMITS ON THE EFFECTS OF THE INVALIDITY OF A COMMUNITY REGULATION , WHETHER UNDER ARTICLE OR ARTICLE , IS A POWER CONFERRED ON THE COURT BY THE TREATY IN THE INTEREST OF THE UNIFORM APPLICATION OF COMMUNITY LAW THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY . IN THE PARTICULAR CASE OF THE JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER , REFERRED TO BY THE TRIBUNAL , THE USE OF THE POSSIBILITY PROVIDED FOR IN THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE WAS BASED ON REASONS OF LEGAL CERTAINTY . . . ' .  IN THAT CONNECTION THE COURT ALSO STATED IN PARAGRAPH OF ITS JUDGMENT OF FEBRUARY THAT ' WHERE IT IS JUSTIFIED BY OVERRIDING CONSIDERATIONS THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE GIVES THE COURT DISCRETION TO DECIDE , IN EACH PARTICULAR CASE , WHICH SPECIFIC EFFECTS OF A REGULATION WHICH HAS BEEN DECLARED VOID MUST BE MAINTAINED . IT IS THEREFORE FOR THE COURT , WHERE IT MAKES USE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF LIMITING THE EFFECT ON PAST EVENTS OF A DECLARATION IN PROCEEDINGS UNDER ARTICLE THAT A MEASURE IS VOID , TO DECIDE WHETHER AN EXCEPTION TO THAT TEMPORAL LIMITATION OF THE EFFECT OF ITS JUDGMENT MAY BE MADE IN FAVOUR OF THE PARTY WHICH BROUGHT THE ACTION BEFORE THE NATIONAL COURT OR OF ANY OTHER TRADER WHO TOOK SIMILAR STEPS BEFORE THE DECLARATION OF INVALIDITY OR WHETHER , CONVERSELY , A DECLARATION OF INVALIDITY APPLICABLE ONLY TO THE FUTURE CONSTITUTES AN ADEQUATE REMEDY EVEN FOR TRADERS WHO TOOK ACTION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME WITH A VIEW TO PROTECTING THEIR RIGHTS ' .  THAT QUESTION , WHICH WAS CONSIDERED IN THE JUDGMENT OF FEBRUARY AND WHICH CONCERNS THE DETERMINATION OF THE SCOPE OF THE JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER , IS HOWEVER IRRELEVANT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS CASE WHICH WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE NATIONAL COURT ON MAY , THAT IS TO SAY AFTER THE IMPLIED DECLARATION TO THE EFFECT THAT THE PROVISIONS REFERRED TO IN THE QUESTION SUBMITTED FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING WERE INVALID .  THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION SUBMITTED BY THE NATIONAL COURT MUST THEREFORE BE THAT , AS THE COURT HAS ALREADY RULED IN ITS JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER IN CASE 145/, THE PROVISIONS OF COMMISSION REGULATION NO 2140/, AS AMENDED BY COMMISSION REGULATION NO 1541/, ARE INVALID IN SO FAR AS THEY FIX THE MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO EXPORTS OF POWDERED GLUCOSE FALLING UNDER SUBHEADING NO 17.B II ( A ) OF THE COMMON CUSTOMS TARIFF . THE FACT THAT THE PROVISIONS OF COMMISSION REGULATION NO 2140/, AS AMENDED BY COMMISSION REGULATION NO 1541/, HAVE BEEN DECLARED INVALID PROVIDES NO GROUND FOR CALLING IN QUESTION THE LEVYING OR PAYMENT OF MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS BY THE NATIONAL AUTHORITIES ON THE BASIS OF THOSE PROVISIONS IN RESPECT OF THE PERIOD PRECEDING OCTOBER , THE DATE ON WHICH THE JUDGMENT DECLARING SUCH PROVISIONS INVALID WAS DELIVERED .  
Decision on costs

THE FACT THAT THE PROVISIONS OF COMMISSION REGULATION NO 2140/, AS AMENDED BY COMMISSION REGULATION NO 1541/, HAVE BEEN DECLARED INVALID PROVIDES NO GROUND FOR CALLING IN QUESTION THE LEVYING OR PAYMENT OF MONETARY COMPENSATORY AMOUNTS BY THE NATIONAL AUTHORITIES ON THE BASIS OF THOSE PROVISIONS IN RESPECT OF THE PERIOD PRECEDING OCTOBER , THE DATE ON WHICH THE JUDGMENT DECLARING SUCH PROVISIONS INVALID WAS DELIVERED .
