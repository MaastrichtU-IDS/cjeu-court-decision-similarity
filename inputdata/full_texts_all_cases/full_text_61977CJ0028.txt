OF FEBRUARY .   ARTICLES AND OF THE DECISION FURTHER STATED THAT ' ' THE APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION UNDER ARTICLE ( ) THAT ARTICLE ( ) IS INAPPLICABLE IS REFUSED IN RESPECT OF THE AGREEMENT REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE HEREOF ' '  AND THE TWO UNDERTAKINGS WERE ORDERED TO BRING THE INFRINGEMENT OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TREATY TO AN END WITHOUT DELAY AND TO REFRAIN FROM ALL FURTHER ACTION OF ANY KIND CALCULATED TO PREVENT THE IMPORTATION INTO OR RESALE IN THE NETHERLANDS OF ANY WATTS PRODUCTS .    2FINALLY A FINE OF U.A .

APPLICATION OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE EEC TREATY   17THE APPLICANT STATES THAT , ALTHOUGH AN ORAL EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT BETWEEN WATTS AND ITSELF HAS CERTAINLY BEEN IN EXISTENCE SINCE , ON THE OTHER HAND AN AGREEMENT RELATING TO THE USE AND REGISTRATION OF TRADE-MARKS HAS AT NO TIME BEEN ENTERED INTO BY THE TWO UNDERTAKINGS .   18IT CLAIMS THAT THE COMMISSION IS WRONG IN MAINTAINING THAT THE APPLICANT HAS USED WATTS ' S TRADE-MARK RIGHTS IN THE NETHERLANDS WITH THE CONSENT OF WATTS .   19IT ASSERTS THAT IT IS THE APPLICANT WHICH ESTABLISHED THE TRADE-MARKS DUST BUG , DISC PREENER AND PARASTAT AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF THE EXCLUSIVE AGENCY AGREEMENT FOR CLEANING APPLIANCES FOR GRAMOPHONE RECORDS MANUFACTURED BY WATTS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM .   20IT STATES FURTHER THAT THEAL ' S TRADE-MARKS IN THE NETHERLANDS AND THOSE OF WATTS IN ENGLAND ARE COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER AND WERE ESTABLISHED SEPARATELY , THE ENGLISH TRADE-MARKS HAVING ORIGINATED WITHOUT THEAL ' S KNOWLEDGE .   21THEAL CLAIMS TO HAVE HAD AN EXCLUSIVE AND INDEPENDENT RIGHT , VESTED IN NO ONE ELSE , TO USE THESE TRADE-MARKS , BUT IT NEVER INTENDED TO USE ITS RIGHTS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO PREVENT EITHER IN FACT OR IN LAW PARALLEL IMPORTS .   22IT STATES THAT IT ONLY ENFORCED ITS TRADE-MARK RIGHTS AGAINST GOODS WHICH WERE NOT GENUINE , BUT MANUFACTURED NEITHER BY WATTS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM NOR BY ITSELF .   23THEAL STATES THAT IT OBTAINED SEVERAL COURT DECISIONS FROM NOVEMBER TO MAY ORDERING THE NETHERLANDS TRADERS TO CEASE WITHIN HOURS TO SELL ARTICLES BEARING THOSE TRADE-MARKS WHICH HAD NOT BEEN SUPPLIED BY THEAL .   24IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE APPLICANT DOES NOT ' ' CLEARLY ' '  UNDERSTAND IN RELIANCE ON WHAT FACTS OR STATEMENTS THE COMMISSION REACHED THE CONCLUSION THAT IT HAS INFRINGED ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TREATY AND THAT THE NOTIFICATION OF THE AGREEMENT ON JANUARY CONTAINS INCORRECT AND MISLEADING INFORMATION .   25THE COMMISSION FINED THEAL INTER ALIA FOR NOT HAVING NOTIFIED IT THAT THE AGREEMENT CONCLUDED WITH WATTS ' ' INCLUDED THE GRANT OF THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO THE TRADE-MARKS IN THE NETHERLANDS ' ' , A CLAUSE OF THE AGREEMENT WHICH THE COMMISSION DISCOVERED ONLY ON JULY AT A MEETING WITH THEAL AND WATTS .   26IT POINTS OUT IN SUPPORT OF THIS ARGUMENT THAT IT WAS WATTS WHO FIRST USED THE WORDS ' ' DUST BUG ' ' , ' ' PARASTAT ' '  AND ' ' DISC PREENER ' ' , AND MOREOVER HAD THE FIRST TWO REGISTERED AS TRADE-MARKS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM ON FEBRUARY AND THE THIRD A LITTLE LATER .   27THE DEFENDANT STATES THAT WATTS CONSENTED , AT THE REQUEST OF THEAL , WITH THE WORDS ' ' DO AS YOU LIKE ' '  TO THE USE BY THEAL OF THE DESIGNATION ' ' DUST BUG ' '  IN ITS OWN NAME IN THE NETHERLANDS .   28THE SPECIFIC CONSENT IN RESPECT OF DUST BUG WAS ALSO GRANTED IN RESPECT OF THE TRADE-MARKS DISC PREENER AND PARASTAT .   29IN A LETTER OF OCTOBER SIGNED BY THE APPLICANT ' S TWO DIRECTORS , THE APPLICANT WROTE TO WATTS AND SAID ' ' WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR COMPANY IS THE PROPRIETOR OF THE TRADE-MARKS DUST BUG , DISC PREENER , PARASTAT AND WATTS . IF YOU AGREE TO WITHDRAW THE REGISTRATION OF THESE TRADE-MARKS IN YOUR NAME ON THE BENELUX REGISTER OR YOUR APPLICATION FOR REGISTRATION , AS THE CASE MAY BE , WE UNDERTAKE TO TAKE AT ANY TIME , AT YOUR REQUEST , THE NECESSARY STEPS TO ASSIGN ANY RIGHTS WHICH WE MAY HAVE TO YOUR COMPANY , OR TO THE COMPANY . . . DESIGNATED BY YOU . . . ' ' .   30THE COMMISSION CONSIDERS THAT THE CONTENT OF THAT LETTER WHICH ARE IN KEEPING WITH THE HISTORY OF THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES , THEIR STATEMENTS AND THEIR CONDUCT CORRECTLY REPRESENTS THE LEGAL SITUATION ARISING OUT OF THEIR AGREEMENTS .   31MOREOVER , THE COMMISSION CONTENDS , THIS SITUATION FOUND SPECIFIC EXPRESSION WHEN WATTS , AFTER HAVING ITS TRADE-MARKS REGISTERED IN THE BENELUX REGISTER ON DECEMBER , HAD THEM STRUCK OUT ON OCTOBER AT THE REQUEST OF THEAL IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE PROGRESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS INSTITUTED BY THE LATTER AGAINST PARALLEL IMPORTERS .   32THE COMMISSION FINDS THAT THE APPLICANT ' S STATEMENTS TO THE EFFECT THAT A FURTHER LETTER OF OCTOBER SUPERSEDED THAT OF OCTOBER ARE IRRELEVANT WHEREAS WATTS ASSERTS THAT IT NEVER RECEIVED THE TEXT OF THIS LETTER OF OCTOBER AND THAT FURTHERMORE IT EMERGES FROM THE REPORT OF ONE OF WATT ' S AUTHORIZED AGENTS AND FROM CORRESPONDENCE PLACED ON THE COURT ' S FILE THAT THE LETTER OF OCTOBER , WRITTEN FOLLOWING VERY DETAILED DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES CONCERNED AND THEIR ADVISERS , WAS INTENDED TO ASSIST THEAL ' S CASE IN ITS PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE INTERVENER MR WILKES .   33ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSION THESE EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS AND AGREEMENTS GRANTING THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO USE THE WATTS TRADE-MARKS WERE IN FACT DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THEAL HAD ABSOLUTE TERRITORIAL PROTECTION EXCLUDING ALL PARALLEL IMPORTS OF AUTHENTIC PRODUCTS AND FOR THIS REASON THEY ARE SUBJECT TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TREATY .   34IN THE COURT ' S VIEW THE FILE AS A WHOLE SHOWS THAT APPLICANT ' S CONDUCT ON THE MARKET FOR CLEANING APPLIANCES FOR GRAMOPHONE RECORDS IN THE NETHERLANDS HAS BEEN AS DESCRIBED BY THE COMMISSION .   35AS FAR AS CONCERNS THE GRANT OF THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO USE THE TRADE-MARKS IN THE NETHERLANDS IT MAY BE ADDED THAT THE DISTINCTIVENESS OF THE WORDS ' ' DUST BUG ' '  WHICH ORIGINATED IN THE BRINGING TOGETHER OF THE WORDS ' ' DUST ' '  AND ' ' BUG ' '  IS INDISPUTABLY TO BE ASCRIBED TO THE INVENTOR OF THE CLEANING APPLIANCE FOR GRAMOPHONE RECORDS .   36IT IS CLEAR FROM AN ARTICLE WHICH APPEARED IN AN ENGLISH PERIODICAL THAT THIS WORDING HAS BEEN USED BY WATTS SINCE .    37IT WAS THEREFORE POSSIBLE FOR THE REGISTRATION OF THIS SPECIFICALLY ENGLISH DESIGNATION AS A TRADE-MARK IN THE NETHERLANDS TO BE EFFECTED BY THEAL ONLY WITH THE CONSENT OF ITS INVENTOR , JUST AS WATTS CONSENTED TO THE REGISTRATION OF THIS TRADE-MARK SUBSEQUENTLY IN BELGIUM , LUXEMBOURG , FRANCE , ITALY AND GERMANY .   38THIS CONSENT GIVEN TO THEAL IN THE MOST GENERAL WAY WITH THE WORDS ' ' DO AS YOU LIKE ' '  INEVITABLY COVERED THE USE OF ALL WATTS ' S TRADE-MARKS .   39THEIR LONG-STANDING RELATIONS AND THE CONFIDENCE AND SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THEAL , A DISTRIBUTOR HAVING A LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE , FOR WATTS AFTER HIS FIRST INVENTIONS , EXPLAIN HOW THEIR RELATIONS CAME INTO BEING AND THEN DEVELOPED WITHOUT THE TWO PARTIES '  HAVING THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO SET THEM DOWN IN WRITING .   40THERE ARE GROUNDS FOR ACCEPTING THAT AS FAR BACK AS THE WATTS AND THEAL UNDERTAKINGS WERE BOUND BY TWO ORAL AGREEMENTS , ONE APPOINTING THEAL AS THE SOLE DISTRIBUTOR OF WATTS ' S PRODUCTS IN THE NETHERLANDS WHEREBY WATTS UNDERTOOK TO SUPPLY THEAL EXCLUSIVELY IN THE NETHERLANDS AND TO PASS ON TO IT ALL ORDERS RECEIVED BY WATTS FOR THE NETHERLANDS , THE OTHER CONSISTING OF THE GRANT OF THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO USE IN THE NETHERLANDS THE TRADE-MARKS AFFIXED TO THESE PRODUCTS .   41THESE ORAL AGREEMENTS MUTUALLY BINDING TWO UNDERTAKINGS WERE AGREEMENT WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE ( ) THE CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH WAS TO GIVE THEAL ABSOLUTE TERRITORIAL PROTECTION IN THE NETHERLANDS .   42FURTHERMORE THIS PROTECTION WAS ENSURED IN BY THE APPLICABLE NATIONAL LAW AND STRENGTHENED LATER BY THE PROHIBITION ON EXPORTS IMPOSED BY WATTS ON WHOLESALERS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND BY THE AFFIXING OF A LABEL ' ' EEN THEAL-PRODUKT ' '  TO PRODUCTS SUPPLIED BY WATTS TO THEAL WHICH ENABLED THE LATTER TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER WATTS PRODUCTS WHICH DID NOT COME FROM ITS OWN UNDERTAKING WERE BEING OFFERED FOR SALE IN THE NETHERLANDS .   43THIS SYSTEM TAKEN AS A WHOLE PROVIDED THEAL WITH THE MEANS OF PREVENTING ALL PARALLEL IMPORTS FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM OR FROM ANY OTHER MEMBER STATE INTO THE NETHERLANDS AND THUS OF ELIMINATING ALL COMPETITION ; IT CONSEQUENTLY LEFT THEAL COMPLETELY FREE TO FIX IN THE NETHERLANDS PRICES FOR THESE PRODUCTS PROTECTED FROM ANY EFFECTIVE COMPETITION FROM PRODUCTS OF THE SAME BRAND .   44THE SKILFUL USE OF TRADE-MARK LAW HAS IN THIS WAY STRENGTHENED THE TERRITORIAL PROTECTION GIVEN BY THE EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT , THE EXISTENCE OF WHICH IS ADMITTED , THE COMBINED EFFECT OF THESE TWO TECHNIQUES SECURING ABSOLUTE AND PERMANENT PROTECTION .   45THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT CANNOT THEREFORE BE EXAMINED WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE CONCERTED PRACTICE WHICH ENSURED ITS EFFICACY .   46FOR AN AGREEMENT TO BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE COMMON MARKET AND PROHIBITED UNDER ARTICLE IT MUST IN THE FIRST PLACE BE ONE ' ' WHICH MAY AFFECT TRADE BETWEEN MEMBER STATES ' ' .   47ALTHOUGH THE CASE-LAW OF THE COURT LAYS DOWN ( JUDGMENT OF NOVEMBER IN CASE 22/, BEGUELIN IMPORT CO . AND OTHERS V S.A.G.L . IMPORT EXPORT AND OTHERS ( ) ECR AT P . ) THAT THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE UNDERTAKINGS WHICH ARE PARTIES TO THE AGREEMENT IS SITUATE IN A NON-MEMBER COUNTRY DOES NOT PREVENT THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLE SINCE THE AGREEMENT IS OPERATIVE ON THE TERRITORY OF THE COMMON MARKET , THE FACT MUST ALSO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THAT SUCH AN AGREEMENT DOES NOT FALL WITHIN THE PROHIBITION CONTAINED IN ARTICLE IF IT AFFECTS TRADE BETWEEN MEMBER STATES ONLY TO AN EXTENT WHICH IS NOT APPRECIABLE .   48AS LONG AS THE UNITED KINGDOM WAS NOT A MEMBER STATE THE RESTRICTIONS ON COMPETITION ARISING OUT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE WATTS/THEAL AGREEMENTS ONLY IN FACT AFFECTED TRADE WITHIN THE NETHERLANDS AND NOTHING IN THE COURT ' S FILE JUSTIFIES THE ASSERTION THAT THE PARTITIONING OF THIS DOMESTIC MARKET APPRECIABLY INTERFERED WITH THE PATTERN OF TRADE BETWEEN MEMBER STATES IN WATTS PRODUCTS BEFORE JANUARY , THE DATE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM ' S ACCESSION TO THE COMMON MARKET .   49THEAL CONTINUED TO OPERATE THESE AGREEMENTS TO ITS ADVANTAGE AFTER THAT DATE SINCE IT OBTAINED JUDGMENTS ON JANUARY AND JUNE AND MAY AGAINST THREE UNDERTAKINGS WHICH WERE FORBIDDEN TO IMPORT WATTS PRODUCTS DIRECTLY INTO THE NETHERLANDS AND IT CONTINUED TO WRITE TO RETAILERS IN THE NETHERLANDS WHO HAD BOUGHT WATTS PRODUCTS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM WHOLESALERS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM , POINTING OUT THAT THESE DEALINGS INFRINGED ITS TRADE-MARK RIGHTS IN THE NETHERLANDS .   50CONSIDERATION OF THE SPECIFIC EFFECTS OF THESE AGREEMENTS SHOWS THAT THEY RESTRICTED INTRA-COMMUNITY TRADE APPRECIABLY SINCE THE SALE OF APPLIANCES OF THE WATTS BRAND IN THE NETHERLANDS ACCOUNTED FOR % OF THE MARKET FOR APPLIANCES FOR CLEANING GRAMOPHONE RECORDS .   51IN VIEW OF THESE FINDINGS IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT SINCE JANUARY THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THEAL AND WATTS AFFECTED TRADE BETWEEN MEMBER STATES .   52A SECOND CONDITION MUST BE FULFILLED BEFORE THE PROHIBITION IN ARTICLE ( ) CAN APPLY , NAMELY THAT THE AGREEMENT HAS AS ITS OBJECT OR EFFECT THE PREVENTION , RESTRICTION OR DISTORTION OF COMPETITION WITHIN THE COMMON MARKET .   53THE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THEAL AND WATTS HAD AS THEIR MAIN OBJECT AND EFFECT THE PREVENTION OF COMPETITION IN THE PROTECTED AREA WITHIN THE COMMON MARKET .   54IT IS APPARENT FROM THE PRACTICES OF THE PARALLEL IMPORTERS AND THE RISKS TO WHICH THEY EXPOSED THEMSELVES BY ENGAGING IN THEM THAT THERE WAS A SPECIFIC DEMAND FOR WATTS ' S PRODUCTS IN THE NETHERLANDS .   55THEAL ' S CONDUCT SHOWS THAT THE LATTER FEARED THE COMPETITION OF TRADERS WHO OBTAINED THEIR SUPPLIES ELSEWHERE SINCE WATTS ' S PRODUCTS ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN % OF ITS TURNOVER .   56IT FOLLOWS FROM ALL THESE FINDINGS THAT , SINCE THE AGREEMENTS IN QUESTION HAVE AS FROM JANUARY AFFECTED TRADE BETWEEN MEMBER STATES IN CLEANING APPLIANCES FOR GRAMOPHONE RECORDS AND THEIR EFFECT HAS BEEN TO DEPRIVE CONSUMERS OF THE BENEFITS FLOWING FROM EFFECTIVE COMPETITION BETWEEN PRODUCTS OF THE SAME BRAND WHICH MIGHT SPRING FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF OUTLETS AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY AND FROM LOWER PRICES , THEY ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE COMMON MARKET AND FALL WITHIN THE PROHIBITION IN ARTICLE ( ).   57FURTHERMORE THESE AGREEMENTS , WHICH BY PREVENTING PARALLEL IMPORTS SECURED FOR THEAL ABSOLUTE TERRITORIAL PROTECTION WHICH WAS MADE STILL MORE EFFECTIVE BY THE PROHIBITION ON EXPORTS IMPOSED BY WATTS , DID NOT CONTRIBUTE EITHER TO IMPROVING THE PRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF GOODS OR TO PROMOTING TECHNICAL OR ECONOMIC PROGRESS AND COULD NOT THEREFORE - EVEN IF THEY HAD BEEN DULY NOTIFIED OR EXEMPTED FROM NOTIFICATION - BE EXEMPTED AS PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE ( ) SINCE THE REQUISITE CONDITIONS FOR THE APPLICATION OF THAT ARTICLE DO NOT EXIST .  THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 58UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO THE COMMISSION MAY IMPOSE FINES OF ONE THOUSAND UNITS OF ACCOUNT OR MORE , BUT NOT EXCEEDING % OF THE TURNOVER IN THE PRECEDING BUSINESS YEAR OF THE UNDERTAKING COMMITTING THE INFRINGMENT WHERE , EITHER INTENTIONALLY OR NEGLIGENTLY , THE UNDERTAKING INFRINGES ARTICLE ( ).   59THE ACTS COMPLAINED OF IN THE CASE OF THEAL FALL WITHIN ARTICLE ( ).   60IN FIXING THE AMOUNT OF THE FINE TO BE IMPOSED UPON IT REGARD MUST BE HAD TO THE DURATION AND GRAVITY OF THE INFRINGEMENT .   61AS FAR THE DURATION IS CONCERNED THE COMMISSION STATED IN THE GROUNDS OF THE DECISION THAT IT DID NOT ' ' PROPOSE TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF INFRINGEMENTS SUBSISTING BEFORE MAY , THE DATE ON WHICH THE EXPORT PROHIBITION WAS CLEARLY IN FORCE AND HAVING EFFECT . ' '  WITH REFERENCE MORE PARTICULARLY TO THEAL THE COMMISSION TOOK AS THE RELEVANT DATE SEPTEMBER , WHICH WAS THE DATE ON WHICH THE APPLICANT FIRST EXERCISED ITS TRADE-MARK RIGHTS TO PREVENT PARALLEL IMPORTS .   62ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT THE FACTS DATE FROM JANUARY THE INFRINGEMENT ONLY MATERIALIZED AS FROM JANUARY , THE DATE OF THE ACCESSION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM TO THE COMMON MARKET .   63AS FAR AS CONCERNS THE DURATION , THE INCONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SEPTEMBER , THE DATE TAKEN BY THE COMMISSION , AND JANUARY , THE DATE WHEN THE INFRINGEMENT ACTUALLY BEGAN , LEADS TO THE VIEW THAT IT SHOULD HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE FIXING OF THE AMOUNT OF THE FINE .   64AS FAR AS CONCERNS ITS GRAVITY IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND THAT THE APPLICANT CONTINUED AFTERWARDS TO ENGAGE IN THIS COURSE OF CONDUCT BY MAKING APPLICATIONS ON THREE OTHER OCCASIONS TO THE NETHERLANDS COURTS , EVEN THOUGH ITS ATTENTION HAD BEEN DRAWN TO THE RULES OF COMPETITION LAID DOWN BY THE TREATY OF ROME .   65FURTHERMORE THEAL ' S ACTIONS HAVE LED TO CLEAR RESTRICTIONS OF COMPETITION WHICH CONTRAVENE ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTIVES OF THE TREATY , NAMELY TO ESTABLISH A SINGLE MARKET IN THE COMMUNITY .   66HOWEVER , ACCOUNT MUST BE TAKEN OF THE FACT THAT THE PRODUCTS IN QUESTION , OWING TO THEIR NATURE , REPRESENT ONLY A SMALL ITEM OF CONSUMERS '  EXPENDITURE .   67ALTHOUGH THEAL ' S CONDUCT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO ELIMINATING COMPETITION BETWEEN PRODUCTS OF THE SAME BRAND , THE LOSS TO THE CONSUMER HAS NOT BEEN SERIOUS IN VIEW OF THE PRICE OF THE PRODUCT IN QUESTION AND ITS RELATIVELY SMALL IMPORTANCE TO THE ORDINARY CONSUMER .   68IN THE LIGHT OF THESE CONSIDERATIONS THE FINE OF U . A . IMPOSED BY THE COMMISSION FOR THE INFRINGEMENT OF ARTICLE ( ) BY THEAL DOES NOT SEEM TO BE OUT OF PROPORTION TO ITS GRAVITY AND DURATION .  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) OF REGULATION NO 69UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO THE COMMISSION MAY BY DECISION IMPOSE ON UNDERTAKINGS FINES OF FROM TO U . A . WHERE , INTENTIONALLY OR NEGLIGENTLY , THEY SUPPLY INCORRECT OR MISLEADING INFORMATION IN A NOTIFICATION PURSUANT TO ARTICLES AND OF THE SAID REGULATION .   70THE INFRACTION COMMITTED BY THEAL IN SUPPLYING INCORRECT AND MISLEADING INFORMATION WAS , IF NOT INTENTIONAL AT LEAST NEGLIGENT , SINCE THE NOTIFICATION FORM CLEARLY DREW ITS ATTENTION TO THE DUTY TO INFORM THE COMMISSION OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE AGREEMENT AND TO STATE WHETHER IT INVOLVED A SHARING OF THE MARKETS OR A RESTRICTION OF FREEDOM TO PURCHASE FROM OR SELL TO THIRD PARTIES OR MIGHT IN ANY OTHER WAY HAVE AS ITS OBJECT OR EFFECT THE RESTRICTION OR DISTORTION OF COMPETITION AND SINCE THE APPLICANT IN ITS NOTIFICATION TO THE COMMISSION DID NOT DISCLOSE THE AGREEMENT GRANTING THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO MAKE USE OF THE TRADE-MARKS REGISTERED IN THE NETHERLANDS AND OF THE EFFECTS OF THE ABSOLUTE TERRITORIAL PROTECTION IN THAT COUNTRY , THE JOINT EFFECT OF THESE TWO AGREEMENTS BEING TO PREVENT PARALLEL IMPORTS AND DISTORT COMPETITION WITHIN THE COMMON MARKET .   71CONSEQUENTLY THE COMMISSION WAS DECEIVED AS TO THE ACTUAL PROVISIONS OF THE AGREEMENTS WHICH BOUND WATTS AND THEAL AS FROM JANUARY , THE DATE OF THE NOTIFICATION , UNTIL WILKES DREW ITS ATTENTION TO THE LATTER IN HIS APPLICATION OF JANUARY .    72HAVING REGARD TO THE GRAVITY OF THIS INFRACTION WHICH LED TO THE MISAPPREHENSION UNDER WHICH THE COMMISSION LABOURED FOR YEARS , THE FINE OF U . A . IMPOSED ON TEPEA APPEARS TO BE COMPLETELY JUSTIFIED .
