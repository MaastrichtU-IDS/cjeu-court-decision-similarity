(Case C‑395/05)
Article 104(3), first subparagraph, of the Rules of Procedure – Freedom of establishment – Freedom to provide services – Rules of competition applicable to undertakings – Interpretation of Articles EC, EC, EC and EC – Games of chance – Collection of bets on sporting events – Licensing requirement – Exclusion of certain operators by reason of their type of corporate form – Requirement of police authorisation – Criminal penalties
Freedom of movement for persons – Freedom of establishment – Freedom to provide services – Restrictions (Arts EC and EC) (see para. 7, operative part 1-4)
Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Tribunale di Viterbo – Interpretation of Articles 31, 43, and to EC – National
                  law making exercise of activity of taking bets subject to obtaining authorisation.
               
Operative part: 
 
National legislation which prohibits the pursuit of the activities of collecting, taking, booking and forwarding offers of
                     bets, in particular bets on sporting events, without a licence or a police authorisation issued by the Member State concerned,
                     constitutes a restriction on the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services, provided for in Articles EC and EC respectively. 
                  
 
It is for the national courts to determine whether, in so far as national legislation limits the number of operators active
                     in the betting and gaming sector, it genuinely contributes to the objective of preventing the exploitation of activities in
                     that sector for criminal or fraudulent purposes. 
                  
 
Articles EC and EC must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings,
                     which excludes – and, moreover, continues to exclude – from the betting and gaming sector operators in the form of companies
                     whose shares are quoted on the regulated markets.
                  
 
Articles EC and EC must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings,
                     which imposes a criminal penalty on persons such as the defendants in the main proceedings for pursuing the organised activity
                     of collecting bets without a licence or a police authorisation as required under the national legislation, where those persons
                     were unable to obtain licences or authorisations because that Member State, in breach of Community law, refused to grant licences
                     or authorisations to such persons.
