Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE REFUSAL TO ACCEPT THE APPLICANT ' S APPLICATION FOR A POST OF LAWYER/LINGUIST .  
Grounds
THE APPLICATION , DATED SEPTEMBER AND ENTERED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON THE SAME DAY , IS BROUGHT AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE AND SEEKS THE ANNULMENT , IN ITS OWN WORDS , ' OF THE REFUSAL TO ACCEPT THE APPLICANT ' S APPLICATION FOR THE COMPETITION FOR THE POST OF LAWYER/LINGUIST OF FRENCH MOTHER TONGUE ' .   AFTER THE APPLICATION WAS LODGED , THE APPLICANT SUBMITTED A COMPLAINT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS .   THE DEFENDANT HAS RAISED AN OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY BASED , PRINCIPALLY , ON NON-COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS IN THAT THE APPLICANT DID NOT , BEFORE LODGING HER APPLICATION , SUBMIT TO THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY A COMPLAINT AGAINST THE ACT ADVERSELY AFFECTING HER , AND , ALTERNATIVELY , ON THE GROUND THAT THE APPLICANT IS NOT A PERSON TO WHOM THE STAFF REGULATIONS APPLY WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   THE DEFENDANT HAS REQUESTED THAT THE COURT ( FIRST CHAMBER ) SHOULD GIVE A RULING ON THIS OBJECTION , UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE , WITHOUT GOING INTO THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CASE .   THIS REQUEST MUST BE GRANTED .   WHILE THE APPLICANT LEAVES IT TO THE DISCRETION OF THE COURT AS REGARDS THE PRINCIPAL OBJECTION RAISED , SHE STATES THAT THE DEFENDANT CANNOT DENY THAT SHE IS A ' PERSON TO WHOM THESE STAFF REGULATIONS APPLY '  AND AT THE SAME TIME CONSIDER HER AS BOUND TO COMPLY WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES PRESCRIBED BY ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .   IF SHE IS NOT A PERSON TO WHOM THE STAFF REGULATIONS APPLY , HER APPLICATION IS BASED ON ARTICLE OF THE TREATY , WHICH PROVISION DOES NOT MAKE THE ADMISSIBILITY OF AN APPLICATION SUBJECT TO THE PRIOR SUBMISSION OF AN APPEAL THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS .   HOWEVER , IN SO FAR AS IT IS BASED ON ARTICLE OF THE TREATY , THE APPLICATION IS INADMISSIBLE SINCE THAT PROVISION CONFERS NO RIGHT TO INSTITUTE PROCEEDINGS FOR ANNULMENT OF THE ACTS OF INSTITUTIONS OTHER THAN THE COUNCIL OR THE COMMISSION .   IN CONSEQUENCE , THE APPLICATION IS ADMISSIBLE ONLY IN SO FAR AS IT IS BASED ON ARTICLE OF THE TREATY , UNDER WHICH THE COURT OF JUSTICE HAS JURISDICTION IN ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND ITS SERVANTS WITHIN THE LIMITS AND UNDER THE CONDITIONS LAID DOWN IN THE STAFF REGULATIONS OR THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT .   IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES , AND WITHOUT THE NEED FOR A DECISION ON THE SUBMISSION OF INADMISSIBILITY BASED ON THE FACT THE APPLICANT IS NOT A ' PERSON TO WHOM THESE STAFF REGULATIONS APPLY '  WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS , WHICH , BY VIRTUE OF ARTICLE OF THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OTHER SERVANTS , HAVE BEEN MADE APPLICABLE BY ANALOGY TO THE SAID ' OTHER SERVANTS ' , AN APPLICATION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE TREATY CANNOT BE DECLARED ADMISSIBLE IN THE ABSENCE OF A PRIOR COMPLAINT AS PROVIDED FOR IN THE SAID ARTICLE .    SINCE THIS ESSENTIAL PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENT HAS NOT BEEN SATISFIED , THE APPLICATION MUST BE DECLARED INADMISSIBLE .  
Decision on costs
COSTS  THE APPLICANT HAS FAILED IN HER SUBMISSIONS .   UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY SHALL BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .   NEVERTHELESS UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE , IN PROCEEDINGS COMMENCED BY SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES THE INSTITUTIONS SHALL BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .   SINCE THE APPLICATION HAS BEEN DECLARED INADMISSIBLE UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OTHER SERVANTS , ARTICLES AND OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE MUST BE APPLIED BY ANALOGY .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE COURT ( FIRST CHAMBER )   HEREBY :   . DISMISSES THE APPLICATION AS INADMISSIBLE ;  . ORDERS EACH PARTY TO BEAR ITS OWN COSTS .
