Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling — Supremo Tribunal Administrativo — Interpretation of Articles TFEU and TFEU — National
                  legislation subjecting dividends distributed to non-resident companies to tax rules less favourable than those applied to
                  dividends distributed to resident companies — Non-resident companies required to have held shares for a longer minimum period
                  and to possess a larger minimum holding.
               
Operative part: 
1.
	Articles TFEU and TFEU preclude the legislation of a  Member State, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which
                     does not permit a company resident in another Member State with a holding of more than 10% but less than 20% in a company
                     resident in Portugal to obtain exemption from the tax withheld at source on dividends distributed by the company resident
                     in Portugal and therefore subjects those dividends to economic double taxation, whereas, if the dividends are distributed
                     to shareholder companies resident in Portugal with the same kind of holdings, such economic double taxation is avoided. Where
                     a Member State relies on a convention for the avoidance of double taxation concluded with another Member State, it is for
                     the national court to establish whether account should be taken, in the main proceedings, of that convention and, if so, to
                     determine whether it enables the effects of the restriction of the free movement of capital to be neutralised.
                  
2.
	Articles TFEU and TFEU preclude the legislation of a Member State, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which
                     permits a company resident in another Member State with a holding greater than 20% in a company resident in Portugal to secure
                     repayment of the tax deducted at source on dividends distributed by the company resident in Portugal only if it has had such
                     a holding for an interrupted period of two years, and thus delays the elimination of economic double taxation by comparison
                     with shareholder companies resident in Portugal with the same kind of shareholdings. When a Member State relies on a convention
                     for the avoidance of double taxation concluded with another Member State, it is for the national court to establish whether
                     account should be taken, in the main proceedings, of that convention and, if so, to determine whether it enables the effects
                     of the restriction of freedom of establishment to be neutralised.
