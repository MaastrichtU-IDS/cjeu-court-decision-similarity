Re:

                  and EC — Permissibility of rules of national law which allow double taxation notwithstanding the existence of a bilateral
                  convention which precludes double taxation — Amendment of national law after the convention had been concluded — Bringing
                  into question of an acquired right — Obstacle to the free movement of capital. 
               
Operative part
In so far as Community law, as applicable at the time of the facts in the main proceedings, does not lay down any general
         criteria for the attribution of areas of competence between the Member States in relation to the elimination of double taxation
         within the European Community, Article EC, read in conjunction with Articles EC and EC, is to be interpreted as
         meaning that it does not preclude a situation in which the Member State, which has undertaken, in a bilateral double taxation
         convention, to establish a mechanism to eliminate such double taxation of dividends, then abolishes that mechanism by way
         of a legislative amendment that has the effect of reintroducing a double taxation.
