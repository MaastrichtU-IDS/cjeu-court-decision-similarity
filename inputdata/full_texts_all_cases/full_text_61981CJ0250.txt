Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT COMMISSION REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1962/OF JULY FIXING , INTER ALIA , THE COEFFICIENTS TO BE APPLIED TO PRODUCTION AID FOR TOMATO CONCENTRATES IN THE 1981/MARKETING YEAR ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) IS VOID , 
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON SEPTEMBER , THE GREEK CANNERS ASSOCIATION , TOGETHER WITH ASTERIS SA AND ADELCAN KANAKARIS BROS , UNDERTAKINGS ENGAGED IN THE PRODUCTION OF TOMATO CONCENTRATES , BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT COMMISSION REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1962/OF JULY , FIXING INTER ALIA THE COEFFICIENTS TO BE APPLIED TO PRODUCTION AID FOR TOMATO CONCENTRATES IN THE 1981/MARKETING YEAR ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), IS VOID IN SO FAR AS IT RELATES TO TOMATO CONCENTRATES PRODUCED IN GREECE .   THE APPLICANTS CONTEND THAT THE CONTESTED REGULATION IS CONTRARY TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE ACT CONCERNING THE CONDITIONS OF ACCESSION OF THE HELLENIC REPUBLIC ( HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' ' THE ACT OF ACCESSION ' ' ) IN SO FAR AS IT TAKES INSUFFICIENT ACCOUNT OF THE PROCESSING COSTS FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF PACKINGS USED IN GREECE .       BY A DOCUMENT DATED OCTOBER , THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES RAISED AN OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE .   ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSION , REGULATION NO 1962/IS LEGISLATIVE IN NATURE , THE RULES WHICH IT CONTAINS ARE EXPRESSED IN GENERAL TERMS , THEY APPLY TO ANYONE ENGAGED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF TOMATO CONCENTRATES AND THEIR CONTENT WAS DETERMINED NOT BY SUBJECTIVE CONSIDERATIONS BUT BY REFERENCE TO OBJECTIVE CRITERIA RELATING TO ' ' DRY EXTRACT CONTENT ' '  AND ' ' IMMEDIATE PACKING ' ' .   IT FOLLOWS THAT THE PROVISIONS IN QUESTION CONSTITUTE A REGULATION , WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY , CONTAINING RULES OF GENERAL APPLICATION AND CONCERNING ALL PRODUCERS OF TOMATO CONCENTRATES IN THE COMMUNITY ; IT IS NOT A DECISION WHICH , ALTHOUGH IN THE FORM OF A REGULATION , IS OF DIRECT AND INDIVIDUAL CONCERN TO THE APPLICANTS . THEREFORE , THE APPLICANTS MAY NOT SEEK TO HAVE IT DECLARED VOID UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY .   THE APPLICANTS MAINTAIN THAT THE REGULATION IN QUESTION IS OF DIRECT AND INDIVIDUAL CONCERN TO THEM SINCE BOTH ASTERIS SA AND ADELCAN KANAKARIS BROS ARE UNDERTAKINGS ENGAGED IN THE PRODUCTION OF TOMATO CONCENTRATES AND HAVE PRODUCED TOMATO CONCENTRATES IN PACKINGS WEIGHING LESS THAN KG .   IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 516/OF MARCH ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), AS MOST RECENTLY AMENDED BY COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1118/OF APRIL ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ), ESTABLISHED A SYSTEM OF PRODUCTION AID FOR TOMATO CONCENTRATES AND PROVIDED THAT THE AMOUNT OF AID IS TO BE DETERMINED BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE MINIMUM PRICE PAYABLE TO TOMATO PRODUCERS AND THE PROCESSING COSTS AND THAT THE PRICE PAYABLE TO PRODUCERS AND THE AMOUNT OF AID ARE TO BE FIXED BY THE COMMISSION FOR EACH MARKETING YEAR .   AS REGARDS GREECE , ARTICLE OF THE ACT OF ACCESSION PROVIDES THAT THE MINIMUM PRICE PAYABLE IS TO BE ESTABLISHED ON THE BASIS OF PRICES PAID IN GREECE TO PRODUCERS FOR A PRODUCT FOR PROCESSING , RECORDED OVER A REPRESENTATIVE PERIOD TO BE DETERMINED . THE AMOUNT OF AID GRANTED IN GREECE IS TO BE DETERMINED BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE MINIMUM PRICE FIXED FOR GREECE AND THE PROCESSING COSTS OBTAINING IN GREECE .       COMMISSION REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1963/OF JULY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) FIXES THE MINIMUM PRICE TO BE PAID TO PRODUCERS PER KG NET WEIGHT OF TOMATOES FOR THE MEMBER STATES OTHER THAN GREECE , ON THE ONE HAND , AND FOR GREECE , ON THE OTHER . THE SAME REGULATION FIXES THE AMOUNT OF AID FOR TOMATO CONCENTRATES IN AN IMMEDIATE PACKING OF KG OR MORE AND MAINTAINS THE DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN GREECE AND THE OTHER MEMBER STATES .   REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1962/, WHICH THE APPLICANTS SEEK TO HAVE DECLARED VOID , FIXES THE COEFFICIENTS TO BE APPLIED TO THE PRODUCTION AID IN ORDER TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE DRY EXTRACT CONTENT AND THE METHOD OF PACKING . THE COEFFICIENTS ARE THE SAME FOR GREECE AND FOR THE OTHER MEMBER STATES .   ACCORDINGLY , IT IS CLEAR THAT THE CONTESTED MEASURE IS A REGULATION WHICH FIXES THE COEFFICIENTS TO BE APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY TO ALL PRODUCERS OF TOMATO CONCENTRATES IN ORDER TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE DRY EXTRACT CONTENT AND THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF PACKING . SUCH A REGULATION IS EXCLUSIVELY LEGISLATIVE IN NATURE AND , ALTHOUGH IT MAY AFFECT THE APPLICANTS , IT IS NOT OF DIRECT AND INDIVIDUAL CONCERN TO THEM WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY . THE APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE REGULATION IS VOID IS THEREFORE INADMISSIBLE .
