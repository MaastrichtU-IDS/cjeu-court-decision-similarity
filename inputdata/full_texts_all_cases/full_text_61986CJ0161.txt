Summary
. It is not only persons who have the status of officials or of employees other than local staff who may bring an action before the Court to contest a decision adversely affecting them but also persons claiming that status ( see judgment of July in Joined Cases 87, 130/77, 22/83, and 10/Salerno v Commission and Council (( )) ECR ).  . The status of official or servant of the Communities cannot be accorded to the staff of the European Association for Cooperation, an international association which is governed by the law of a Member State and which cannot, whatever may be its relations with the Commission, be assimilated to an administrative unit of the Commission ( see judgment in Salerno, supra ).  As a result no provision of the Staff Regulations can be effectively relied on to contest a decision of dismissal taken by the aforesaid association in its capacity as employer in accordance with the rules governing its employment relationship with its staff .
