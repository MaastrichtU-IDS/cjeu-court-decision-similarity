Subject of the case
APPLICATION , AT THIS STAGE OF THE PROCEDURE , FOR A DECISION ON THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION REQUESTING THE COURT TO DECLARE VOID THE DECISION OF APRIL WHEREBY THE COMMISSION TERMINATED THE PROCEDURE INITIATED UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE EEC TREATY BY LETTER OF NOVEMBER TO THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT AND WHICH WAS NOTIFIED TO THE APPLICANT BY THE COMMISSION ' S LETTER OF APRIL , 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON JULY , COMPAGNIE FRANCAISE DE L ' AZOTE ( COFAZ ) SA , SOCIETE CDF CHIMIE AZOTE ET FERTILISANTS SA AND SOCIETE CHIMIQUE DE LA GRANDE PAROISSE SA BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY IN WHICH THEY REQUESTED THE COURT TO DECLARE VOID THE DECISION OF APRIL WHEREBY THE COMMISSION TERMINATED THE PROCEDURE INITIATED UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE EEC TREATY AGAINST THE TARIFF STRUCTURE FOR NATURAL GAS PRICES IN THE NETHERLANDS BY LETTER OF NOVEMBER ADDRESSED TO THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT .  THE COMMISSION CHALLENGED THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION , WITHOUT EXPRESSLY RAISING AN OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE . THE COURT , PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THOSE RULES , DECIDED TO GIVE A DECISION ON THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION FIRST WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CASE .  ON JUNE THE SYNDICAT PROFESSIONNEL DE L ' INDUSTRIE DES ENGRAIS AZOTES ( SPIEA ) ( TRADE ASSOCIATION OF PRODUCERS OF NITRATE FERTILIZERS , HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ' THE SYNDICAT ' ), ACTING INTER ALIA ON BEHALF OF THE APPLICANTS , SUBMITTED A COMPLAINT TO THE COMMISSION AGAINST THE APPLICATION BY THE NETHERLANDS OF A PREFERENTIAL TARIFF SYSTEM TO NETHERLANDS PRODUCERS OF NITRATE FERTILIZERS FOR THE SUPPLY OF NATURAL GAS INTENDED FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF AMMONIA . THE BELGIAN AND FRENCH GOVERNMENTS , TOGETHER WITH A GERMAN UNDERTAKING , ALSO RAISED OBJECTIONS TO THAT PREFERENTIAL TARIFF SYSTEM WHICH WERE TRANSMITTED TO THE COMMISSION .  ON OCTOBER THE COMMISSION DECIDED TO INITIATE THE PROCEDURE UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE EEC TREATY AGAINST THE AFORESAID TARIFF SYSTEM . ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSION , THE AID SCHEME IN QUESTION WAS A SYSTEM WHEREBY THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT , THROUGH GASUNIE ( THE GAS BOARD ), GRANTED SPECIAL REBATES BY MEANS OF A TWO-TIER TARIFF STRUCTURE WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF REDUCING THE COST OF NATURAL GAS USED AS A FEEDSTOCK FOR NETHERLANDS AMMONIA PRODUCERS . BY LETTER OF NOVEMBER , THE COMMISSION INFORMED THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT THAT IT HAD INITIATED THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PROCEDURE . BY NOTICE DATED DECEMBER GIVEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE ( ) OF THE EEC TREATY TO THE PARTIES CONCERNED REGARDING A TARIFF STRUCTURE FOR NATURAL GAS PRICES IN THE NETHERLANDS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , C , P . ), THE COMMISSION INVITED THOSE PARTIES TO SUBMIT THEIR COMMENTS .  AVAILING ITSELF OF THE POSSIBILITY OFFERED IN THE AFOREMENTIONED NOTICE , THE SYNDICAT AGAIN MADE REPRESENTATIONS TO THE COMMISSION IN A LETTER DATED JANUARY AND IN ITS OBSERVATIONS CONFIRMED ITS COMPLAINT AND PROVIDED FURTHER PARTICULARS THEREOF .  AT THE SAME TIME AS THE PROCEDURE PROVIDED FOR BY ARTICLE ( ), THE COMMISSION SET IN MOTION THE PROCEDURE UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY , IN RESPONSE TO A COMPLAINT FROM THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT DIRECTED AGAINST THE SAME TARIFF SYSTEM . IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURE UNDER ARTICLE , THE COMMISSION DELIVERED A REASONED OPINION ON MARCH IN WHICH IT FOUND THAT , BY GRANTING THROUGH GASUNIE A PREFERENTIAL TARIFF FOR THE SUPPLY OF NATURAL GAS TO NETHERLANDS PRODUCERS OF AMMONIA AND OF NITRATE FERTILIZERS , THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS HAD FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE OF THE TREATY . MOREOVER , THE COMMISSION RESERVED ITS POSITION WITH REGARD TO THE ATTITUDE WHICH IT WOULD ADOPT IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROCEDURE INITIATED UNDER ARTICLE ( ).  IN A MEMORANDUM DATED MARCH , THE SYNDICAT , STILL ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE APPLICANTS , MADE FURTHER REPRESENTATIONS TO THE COMMISSION AND RAISED A NUMBER OF OBJECTIONS TO THE SYSTEM OF NATURAL GAS TARIFFS WHICH HAD IN THE MEANTIME BEEN AMENDED BY GASUNIE .  BY TELEX MESSAGE OF APRIL THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT INFORMED THE COMMISSION THAT GASUNIE HAD AGAIN AMENDED ITS INDUSTRIAL TARIFF STRUCTURE WITH RETROACTIVE EFFECT FROM NOVEMBER , THEREBY ABOLISHING THE TWO TARIFF SYSTEMS TO WHICH THE SYNDICAT HAD OBJECTED IN ITS COMPLAINT OF JUNE AND IN ITS OBSERVATIONS OF JANUARY , ON THE ONE HAND , AND IN ITS MEMORANDUM OF MARCH ON THE OTHER .  TAKING THE VIEW THAT THE NEW TARIFF SYSTEM ESTABLISHED BY GASUNIE WAS COMPATIBLE WITH THE COMMON MARKET , THE COMMISSION DECIDED AT ITS MEETING ON APRIL TO TERMINATE THE PROCEDURE WHICH HAD BEEN INITIATED UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE EEC TREATY AGAINST THE TARIFF SYSTEM ESTABLISHED BY GASUNIE . IT NOTIFIED THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT OF ITS DECISION BY LETTER OF MAY . THE APPLICANTS HAD ALREADY BEEN INFORMED OF THAT DECISION , THROUGH THE SYNDICAT , BY LETTER OF APRIL WHICH WAS COUCHED IN TERMS BROADLY SIMILAR TO THOSE USED IN THE LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT .  THE COMMISSION CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE NEW TARIFF SYSTEM WAS COMPATIBLE WITH THE COMMON MARKET ESSENTIALLY FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS : GASUNIE HAD ABOLISHED THE TWO-TIER TARIFF SYSTEM AND HAD ADDED TO ITS INTERNAL INDUSTRIAL TARIFF STRUCTURE ( NAMELY TARIFFS B - E ) A NEW TARIFF , KNOWN AS TARIFF F , FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE MAJOR INDUSTRIAL USERS IN THE NETHERLANDS . IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR THAT NEW TARIFF , USERS HAD TO CONSUME AT LEAST MILLION CUBIC METRES OF GAS PER YEAR AND OPERATE 90% OF THE TIME OR MORE AND THEY HAD TO ACCEPT TOTAL OR PARTIAL INTERRUPTIONS OF SUPPLIES AT GASUNIE ' S DISCRETION OR SUPPLIES OF NATURAL GAS HAVING DIFFERENT CALORIFIC VALUES . THE NEW TARIFF , TARIFF F , FORMED AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE GENERAL TARIFF STRUCTURE FOR USERS IN THE NETHERLANDS AND DID NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN SECTORS . THE VALUE OF THE REBATE GRANTED TO THE UNDERTAKINGS ELIGIBLE FOR THE NEW TARIFF ( BY COMPARISON WITH TARIFF E ) WAS EVEN LOWER THAN THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE SAVINGS MADE BY GASUNIE ON ACCOUNT OF THE VOLUME OF CONSUMPTION BY THOSE UNDERTAKINGS AND THE OTHER AFOREMENTIONED CONDITIONS OF THE NEW TARIFF SYSTEM . TARIFF F WAS THEREFORE JUSTIFIED IN ECONOMIC TERMS .  AFTER CONSIDERING THE COMMISSION ' S LETTER OF APRIL , THE SYNDICAT REPLIED ON MAY SETTING OUT ITS OBJECTIONS TO THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION TO TERMINATE THE PROCEDURE IN QUESTION . IN ITS LETTERS OF AND JUNE , THE COMMISSION REFUTED THOSE OBJECTIONS .  IT IS THE DECISION OF APRIL TERMINATING THE PROCEDURE UNDER ARTICLE ( ) THAT THE APPLICANTS ARE SEEKING TO HAVE ANNULLED IN THIS APPLICATION UNDER THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY . IN THEIR APPLICATION THEY MAINTAIN THAT THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION IS VITIATED BY MANIFEST ERRORS IN THE ASSESSMENT OF ESSENTIAL INFORMATION , PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE APPRAISAL OF THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE SAVINGS MADE BY GASUNIE AS A RESULT OF THE CONDITIONS FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE NEW TARIFF . IN THEIR VIEW , TARIFF F IS MERELY AN ATTEMPT TO MAINTAIN IN A DIFFERENT GUISE THE PREVIOUS TARIFF SYSTEM .  THE COMMISSION CONSIDERS THAT THE CONTESTED DECISION IS NOT OF INDIVIDUAL CONCERN TO THE APPLICANTS , WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE . IT DOES NOT DENY THAT IN DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES AN ACTION MAY BE ADMISSIBLE WHERE IT IS BROUGHT BY AN UNDERTAKING OTHER THAN THAT TO WHICH A DECISION TERMINATING AN INVESTIGATION PROCEDURE INITIATED UNDER ARTICLE ( ) IS ADDRESSED , BUT SUBMITS THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF BRINGING PROCEEDINGS IN THIS CASE SHOULD BE INTERPRETED RESTRICTIVELY . IN ITS VIEW , THERE ARE NO ATTRIBUTES PECULIAR TO THE APPLICANTS WHICH DIFFERENTIATE THEM FROM ALL OTHER PERSONS . NEITHER THE FACT OF BEING AMMONIA PRODUCERS NOR THE FACT THAT THEY WERE ALLEGEDLY TREATED IN A DISCRIMINATORY MANNER IS SUFFICIENT , IN THE COMMISSION ' S VIEW , TO DISTINGUISH THEM INDIVIDUALLY . IN ANY EVENT , SINCE ARTICLES AND OF THE TREATY DID NOT CONFER A RIGHT ON INDIVIDUALS , A DECISION BASED ON THOSE ARTICLES IN NO WAY AFFECTS THE LEGAL POSITION OF INDIVIDUALS . FINALLY , THE COMMISSION MAINTAINS THAT THE DECISION IS NOT OF INDIVIDUAL CONCERN TO THE APPLICANTS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY PRODUCERS OF NITRATE FERTILIZERS IN THE COMMUNITY .  THE COMMISSION CONSIDERS THAT THE APPLICANTS '  INVOLVEMENT IN THE INITIATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE DOES NOT INDIVIDUALLY DISTINGUISH THEM EITHER . THEY MERELY PROVIDED SOME INFORMATION AND THAT CANNOT BE COMPARED TO THE ROLE OF COMPLAINANTS IN A PROCEDURE UNDER REGULATION NO OF THE COUNCIL OF FEBRUARY ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION 1959-, P . ) OR UNDER COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 3017/OF DECEMBER ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ). ARTICLES , AND DO NOT CONFER A SPECIFIC STATUS ON THE APPLICANTS . HOWEVER , EVEN ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE APPLICANTS HAD A RIGHT TO REQUEST THE COMMISSION TO BRING TO AN END AN AID WHICH WAS ALLEGEDLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE COMMON MARKET , THAT WOULD NOT IN ITSELF DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY HAD AN INTEREST IN CHALLENGING A DECISION ESTABLISHING THAT THE AID WAS NOT INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE COMMON MARKET . SINCE THE COURT HAS RECOGNIZED THE DIRECT EFFECT OF ARTICLE ( ), INASMUCH AS IT ESTABLISHES PROCEDURAL CRITERIA WHICH THE NATIONAL COURTS CAN APPLY AND CONFERS RIGHTS ON INDIVIDUALS WHICH THE NATIONAL COURTS MUST PROTECT , IT FOLLOWS , IN THE COMMISSION ' S VIEW , THAT AN INFRINGEMENT OF ARTICLE ( ) MAY BE PENALIZED DIRECTLY BY THE NATIONAL COURTS . THE APPLICANTS ARE NOT , THEREFORE , DENIED ANY REDRESS WHATSOEVER .  THE COMMISSION CONCLUDES THIS LINE OF REASONING WITH A REFERENCE TO THE CASE-LAW OF THE COURT , ACCORDING TO WHICH THE COMMISSION ENJOYS A BROAD DISCRETION WITH REGARD TO THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLE . IT FOLLOWS , IN ITS VIEW , FIRST THAT ARTICLE DOES NOT HAVE DIRECT EFFECT , AND SECONDLY THAT THE COMMISSION ALONE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR INITIATING THE PROCEDURE UNDER ARTICLE ( ).  WITH REGARD TO THE QUESTION WHETHER THE CONTESTED DECISION IS OF DIRECT CONCERN TO THE APPLICANTS , THE COMMISSION EMPHASIZES THAT THE MERE FACT THAT THEY ARE COMPETING WITH UNDERTAKINGS ALLEGEDLY IN RECEIPT OF STATE AID DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCE ENABLING THEM TO CLAIM THAT THE DECISION AFFECTS THEIR POSITION ON THE MARKET . IN THE COMMISSION ' S VIEW , HOWEVER , A SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCE OF THAT KIND IS NECESSARY , ACCORDING TO THE CASE-LAW OF THE COURT , IN ORDER FOR PROCEEDINGS UNDER ARTICLE TO BE BROUGHT . MOREOVER , THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF THE APPLICANTS IS DIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON THE GAS TARIFFS CHARGED BY THEIR SUPPLIER , NAMELY GAZ DE FRANCE , AND NOT ON THE GAS TARIFFS WHICH GASUNIE CHARGES TO NETHERLANDS PRODUCERS .  THE APPLICANTS MAINTAIN ON THE CONTRARY THAT FROM THE INCEPTION OF THE PROCEDURE UNTIL THE ADOPTION OF THE CONTESTED DECISION THE ISSUE HAD REMAINED THE SAME , NAMELY THE ASSESSMENT OF A REBATE GRANTED TO CERTAIN USERS OF NATURAL GAS IN THE NETHERLANDS . THEY CONSIDER THAT THE DECISION IS OF INDIVIDUAL CONCERN TO THEM INASMUCH AS THEY ARE PLACED AT A SERIOUS DISADVANTAGE BY THE FAVOURABLE COMPETITIVE POSITION ENJOYED BY THEIR NETHERLANDS COMPETITORS . FURTHERMORE , THEY CONTEND THAT THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THE INITIATION AND COURSE OF THE PROCEDURE DISTINGUISHES THEM INDIVIDUALLY FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE . THEY MAINTAIN THAT THE COMMISSION ITSELF RECOGNIZED THEIR INVOLVEMENT BY NOTIFYING THE CONTESTED DECISION TO THEM . ACCORDING TO THE APPLICANTS , AN UNDERTAKING WHICH IS ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN AID HAS A RIGHT SIMILAR TO THAT CONFERRED BY ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO OF THE COUNCIL TO REQUEST THE COMMISSION TO GIVE A DECISION ON THE LEGALITY OF THE AID .  THE APPLICANTS ALSO CONSIDER THAT THE CONTESTED DECISION IS OF DIRECT CONCERN TO THEM , FIRST BECAUSE THEY CLAIM TO BE DETRIMENTALLY AFFECTED BY A DISTORTION OF COMPETITION , AND SECONDLY BECAUSE THAT ADVERSE IMPACT IS THE RESULT OF THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION . IN SO FAR AS THE PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY THE NETHERLANDS PRODUCERS ARE MARKETED WITHIN THE COMMUNITY , THE APPLICANTS CLAIM THAT THE DECISION AFFECTS THEIR POSITION ON THE MARKET .  IN THE APPLICANTS '  VIEW , IT IS APPARENT FROM THE RECENT CASE-LAW OF THE COURT THAT ACCOUNT SHOULD BE TAKEN OF THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH ARTICLES AND ARE BASED . ACCORDINGLY , THE ABSENCE OF REGULATIONS WHICH ACCORD THE APPLICANTS SPECIFIC RIGHTS DURING THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE IS NOT A DECISIVE FACTOR . MOREOVER , THE APPLICANTS CONSIDER THAT THE CONTESTED DECISION IS OF DIRECT CONCERN TO THEM ON THE GROUND THAT IT ENTERED INTO FORCE IMMEDIATELY , WITHOUT BEING IMPLEMENTED BY ANY COMMUNITY OR NATIONAL MEASURE .  IT SHOULD BE STATED , BY WAY OF A PRELIMINARY OBSERVATION , THAT IN ORDER TO EXAMINE THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION AND WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CASE , IT IS NECESSARY TO TAKE AS A BASIS THE APPLICANTS '  CONTENTIONS TO THE EFFECT THAT TARIFF F , WHICH WAS ADDED BY GASUNIE TO ITS INDUSTRIAL TARIFF STRUCTURE AND WAS APPLIED TO NATURAL GAS SUPPLIED TO THE MAJOR USERS IN THE NETHERLANDS , CONSTITUTES AN AID GRANTED BY THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT IN FAVOUR OF THE THREE NETHERLANDS PRODUCERS OF AMMONIA AND NITRATE FERTILIZERS .  IN THE FIRST PLACE IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND THAT , IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE , A NATURAL OR LEGAL PERSON MAY , UNDER THE CONDITIONS SET OUT IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THAT ARTICLE , INSTITUTE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST A DECISION ADDRESSED TO ANOTHER PERSON ONLY IF THAT DECISION IS OF DIRECT AND INDIVIDUAL CONCERN TO THE FORMER . ACCORDINGLY , THE APPLICANTS '  RIGHT OF ACTION DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE DECISION ADDRESSED TO THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT WHEREBY THE COMMISSION TERMINATED THE PROCEDURE INITIATED UNDER ARTICLE ( ) AGAINST THE NETHERLANDS IS OF DIRECT AND INDIVIDUAL CONCERN TO THEM .  IT IS CLEAR FROM A CONSISTENT LINE OF DECISIONS OF THE COURT THAT PERSONS OTHER THAN THOSE TO WHOM A DECISION IS ADDRESSED MAY CLAIM TO BE CONCERNED WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ONLY IF THAT DECISION AFFECTS THEM BY REASON OF CERTAIN ATTRIBUTES WHICH ARE PECULIAR TO THEM , OR BY REASON OF CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THEY ARE DIFFERENTIATED FROM ALL OTHER PERSONS , AND BY VIRTUE OF THESE FACTORS DISTINGUISHES THEM INDIVIDUALLY JUST AS IN THE CASE OF THE PERSON ADDRESSED ( JUDGMENT OF JULY IN CASE 25/PLAUMANN V COMMISSION ( ) ECR ).  MORE PARTICULARLY , AS REGARDS THE CIRCUMSTANCES REFERRED TO IN THAT JUDGMENT , THE COURT HAS REPEATEDLY HELD THAT WHERE A REGULATION ACCORDS APPLICANT UNDERTAKINGS PROCEDURAL GUARANTEES ENTITLING THEM TO REQUEST THE COMMISSION TO FIND AN INFRINGEMENT OF COMMUNITY RULES , THOSE UNDERTAKINGS SHOULD BE ABLE TO INSTITUTE PROCEEDINGS IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEIR LEGITIMATE INTERESTS ( JUDGMENTS OF OCTOBER IN CASE 26/METRO V COMMISSION ( ) ECR , OCTOBER IN CASE 191/FEDIOL V COMMISSION ( ) ECR , AND OCTOBER IN CASE 210/DEMO-STUDIO SCHMIDT V COMMISSION ( ) ECR ).  IN ITS JUDGMENT OF MARCH IN CASE 264/( TIMEX CORPORATION V COUNCIL AND COMMISSION ( ) ECR ) THE COURT POINTED OUT THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO EXAMINE IN THAT REGARD THE PART PLAYED BY THE UNDERTAKING IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS . THE COURT ACCEPTED AS EVIDENCE THAT THE MEASURE IN QUESTION WAS OF CONCERN TO THE UNDERTAKING , WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY , THE FACT THAT THE UNDERTAKING WAS AT THE ORIGIN OF THE COMPLAINT WHICH LED TO THE OPENING OF THE INVESTIGATION PROCEDURE , THE FACT THAT ITS VIEWS WERE HEARD DURING THAT PROCEDURE AND THE FACT THAT THE CONDUCT OF THE PROCEDURE WAS LARGELY DETERMINED BY ITS OBSERVATIONS .  THE SAME CONCLUSIONS APPLY TO UNDERTAKINGS WHICH HAVE PLAYED A COMPARABLE ROLE IN THE PROCEDURE REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY PROVIDED , HOWEVER , THAT THEIR POSITION ON THE MARKET IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE AID WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THE CONTESTED DECISION . ARTICLE ( ) RECOGNIZES IN GENERAL TERMS THAT THE UNDERTAKINGS CONCERNED ARE ENTITLED TO SUBMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO THE COMMISSION BUT DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY FURTHER DETAILS .  WITH REGARD TO THE POSITION OF THE APPLICANTS WHILST THE COMMISSION ' S INVESTIGATION CONCERNING THE AID IN QUESTION WAS IN PROGRESS , IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT ON JUNE THEY LODGED A COMPLAINT WITH THE COMMISSION CONCERNING THE PREFERENTIAL TARIFF SYSTEM IN FAVOUR OF NETHERLANDS PRODUCERS OF NITRATE FERTILIZERS . IN THEIR COMPLAINT , THEY LAID PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THEIR COMPETITIVE POSITION IN RELATION TO THE THREE NETHERLANDS PRODUCERS AND ON THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THE AID . MOREOVER , THE APPLICANTS COMPLIED WITH THE COMMISSION ' S REQUEST TO SUBMIT THEIR COMMENTS UNDER ARTICLE ( ).  WITH REGARD TO THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC FACTORS AS A WHOLE ON THE MARKET IN NITRATE FERTILIZERS , THE APPLICANTS HAVE POINTED OUT THAT , ACCORDING TO THEIR CALCULATIONS , THE PREFERENTIAL TARIFF SYSTEM REPRESENTS AN ANNUAL TRANSFER OF APPROXIMATELY HFL MILLION TO THE THREE NETHERLANDS PRODUCERS OF AMMONIA . ACCORDING TO THE APPLICANTS IN FRANCE THE COST OF NATURAL GAS REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 80% OF THE EX-WORKS COST PRICE OF AMMONIA WHICH , IN ITS TURN , IS THE RAW MATERIAL FROM WHICH NITRATE FERTILIZERS ARE MANUFACTURED . THEY HAVE ALSO ARGUED THAT THEY COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH THE THREE NETHERLANDS PRODUCERS OF NITRATE FERTILIZERS WHO , BETWEEN AND , MORE THAN TRIPLIED THEIR VOLUME OF EXPORTS OF NITRATE FERTILIZERS TO FRANCE AND WHOSE SHARE OF THE FRENCH MARKET ROSE BETWEEN AND FROM 9% TO 21.7% .  IT IS NOT FOR THE COURT , AT THIS STAGE OF THE PROCEDURE , WHEN IT IS CONSIDERING WHETHER THE APPLICATION IS ADMISSIBLE , TO MAKE A DEFINITIVE FINDING ON THE COMPETITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE APPLICANTS AND THE NETHERLANDS UNDERTAKINGS . IT IS SUFFICIENT TO NOTE THAT THE APPLICANTS HAVE ADDUCED PERTINENT REASONS TO SHOW THAT THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THEIR LEGITIMATE INTERESTS BY SERIOUSLY JEOPARDIZING THEIR POSITION ON THE MARKET IN QUESTION .  IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES , THE FACT THAT , ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSION , A FOURTH UNDERTAKING WHICH IS NOT IN COMPETITION WITH THE APPLICANTS ALSO QUALIFIES FOR TARIFF F IS IMMATERIAL . AGAIN ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE AID IN QUESTION FALLS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF ARTICLE , THE ADVANTAGE GAINED FROM A TARIFF SYSTEM BY AN OUTSIDE UNDERTAKING NOT IN COMPETITION WITH THE APPLICANTS DOES NOT DETRACT FROM THE VALIDITY OF THE ARGUMENT THAT A SYSTEM OF THAT KIND MAY DISTORT OR THREATEN TO DISTORT COMPETITION BETWEEN THE OTHER UNDERTAKINGS AND DOES NOT AFFECT THE SUBSTANTIVE NATURE OF THE DAMAGE ALLEGEDLY SUSTAINED BY THE APPLICANTS .  AS REGARDS THE QUESTION WHETHER THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION TO TERMINATE THE PROCEDURE IS OF DIRECT CONCERN TO THE APPLICANTS , IT IS SUFFICIENT TO OBSERVE THAT THE DECISION HAS LEFT INTACT ALL THE EFFECTS OF THE TARIFF SYSTEM SET UP , WHILST THE PROCEDURE SOUGHT BY THE APPLICANTS WOULD LEAD TO THE ADOPTION OF A DECISION TO ABOLISH OR AMEND THAT SYSTEM . IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES , IT MUST BE HELD THAT THE CONTESTED DECISION IS OF DIRECT CONCERN TO THE APPLICANTS .  IT FOLLOWS THAT THE CONTESTED MEASURE IS A DECISION OF DIRECT AND INDIVIDUAL CONCERN TO THE APPLICANTS , WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .  FOR ALL THOSE REASONS , THE APPLICATION MUST BE DECLARED ADMISSIBLE AND THE PROCEEDINGS MUST TAKE THEIR COURSE .
