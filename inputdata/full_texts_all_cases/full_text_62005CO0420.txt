Re:
Appeal brought against the judgment of the Court of First Instance (First Chamber) of September in Case T-53/Ricosmos
 v 
Commission
, by which the Court of First Instance dismissed the application for annulment of Commission Decision REM 09/of November
                  informing the Netherlands authorities that there were no grounds for remission of import duties in respect of a consignment
                  of cigarettes intended for the Czech Republic on the ground that fraud committed by third parties in the course of an external
                  Community transit operation does not constitute a special situation justifying remission of the import duties.
               
Operative part:
 
The appeal is dismissed.
 
Ricosmos BV is ordered to pay the costs.
