Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON DECEMBER , THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT , BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 79/32/EEC OF DECEMBER ON TAXES OTHER THAN TURNOVER TAXES WHICH AFFECT THE CONSUMPTION OF MANUFACTURED TOBACCO , THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY .   THE PURPOSE OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 79/OF DECEMBER ON TAXES OTHER THAN TURNOVER TAXES WHICH AFFECT THE CONSUMPTION OF MANUFACTURED TOBACCO ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL , L , P . ) IS TO DEFINE THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MANUFACTURED TOBACCO . ARTICLE PROVIDES THAT THE MEMBER STATES MUST BRING INTO FORCE THE LAWS , REGULATIONS OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THE DIRECTIVE NOT LATER THAN JANUARY AND THAT THEY MUST FORTHWITH INFORM THE COMMISSION THEREOF .   THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DENY THAT IT HAS NOT FULFILLED THAT OBLIGATION . IT STATES THAT THE DELAY IN IMPLEMENTING THE DIRECTIVE IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT DRAFT LAW NO , WHICH WAS LAID BEFORE THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES ON MAY FOR THAT PURPOSE , COULD NOT COMPLETE THE PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE BECAUSE OF THE EARLY DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT . A NEW DRAFT LAW IS BEING PREPARED IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE DIRECTIVE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE .   THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES CANNOT EXPUNGE THE FAILURE TO FULFIL ONE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS WITH WHICH THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC IS CHARGED . ACCORDING TO WELL-    ESTABLISHED CASE-LAW OF THE COURT , A MEMBER STATE MAY NOT PLEAD PROVISIONS , PRACTICES OR CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING IN ITS INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OBLIGATIONS AND TIME-LIMITS LAID DOWN IN COMMUNITY DIRECTIVES .   IT MUST THEREFORE BE HELD THAT , BY FAILING TO ADOPT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE PROVISIONS NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 79/32/EEC OF DECEMBER , THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EEC TREATY .
