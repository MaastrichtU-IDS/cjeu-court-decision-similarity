Summary
. ALTHOUGH THE VACANCY NOTICE MUST NECESSARILY PRECEDE THE NOTICE OF COMPETITION, FAILING WHICH THERE IS AN INFRINGEMENT OF THE SECOND AND THIRD PARAGRAPHS OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS, THIS IS IN ORDER TO ENABLE THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY TO EXAMINE, BEFORE COMMENCING THE PROCEDURE FOR A COMPETITION, WHETHER THE POST SHOULD BE FILLED BY TRANSFER OR PROMOTION .  . THE ORGANIZATION OF A SINGLE COMPETITION FOR DIFFERENT POSTS CORRESPONDING TO DIFFERENT GRADES WITH THE PROVISION THAT THE TASKS REQUIRING MORE RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR THE HIGHEST PLACED CANDIDATES DOES NOT INFRINGE ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS WHEN THESE DIFFERENT POSTS INVOLVE THE PERFORMANCE OF LARGELY SIMILAR DUTIES .  . IN CASES OF PROMOTION BY CHANGE OF CATEGORY, THE ADMINISTRATION ENJOYS A WIDE DISCRETION IN DECIDING UPON THE CRITERIA OF ABILITY REQUIRED FOR THE NEWLY-CREATED POSTS AND CONSEQUENTLY IN DECIDING UPON THE RULES OF THE COMPETITION IN VIEW OF THESE CRITERIA AND IN THE INTERESTS OF THE SERVICE .  . IT APPEARS CLEARLY BOTH FROM A COMPARISON OF THE VERSIONS IN THE VARIOUS LANGUAGES AND FROM THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FIRST AND THIRD PARAGRAPHS OF ARTICLE OF ANNEX III TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS THAT THIS PROVISION MUST BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT IF THE MEMBERS OF THE SELECTION BOARD ARE OFFICIALS THEY MUST BE OF A GRADE AT LEAST EQUAL TO THAT OF THE POST TO BE FILLED WITHOUT, HOWEVER, EITHER THE MEMBERS OR THE PRESIDENT OF THE SELECTION BOARD HAVING NECESSARILY TO BE OFFICIALS .  . THE INTERVENTION OF A THIRD PARTY IN THE ORGANIZATION OF THE COMPETITION TESTS IS AUTHORIZED BY THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF ANNEX III TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS ON CONDITION THAT IT IS IN AN ADVISORY CAPACITY AND THAT THE SELECTION BOARD RETAINS ULTIMATE CONTROL OVER THE PROCEDURES AND ITS DISCRETIONARY POWER .

IN CASE 90/FRANCINE GELDERS ( NEE DEBOECK ), AN OFFICIAL OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, RESIDING AT STOBBAERTSDREEF, OVERIJSE ( BELGIUM ), REPRESENTED BY MARCEL SLUSNY, ADVOCATE AT THE COUR D'APPEL, BRUSSELS, WITH AN ADDRESS FOR SERVICE IN LUXEMBOURG AT THE CHAMBERS OF ERNEST ARENDT, CENTRE LOUVIGNY, B IV, RUE PHILIPPE-II, APPLICANT,  V  COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, REPRESENTED BY ITS LEGAL ADVISER, THOMAS F .

Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF INTERNAL COMPETITION COM/BS/9/TOGETHER WITH THE APPOINTMENTS MADE AS A RESULT OF THAT COMPETITION . 
Grounds
THE APPLICATION LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON NOVEMBER IS ESSENTIALLY FOR THE ANNULMENT OF INTERNAL COMPETITION COM/BS/9/BASED ON QUALIFICATIONS AND ON TESTS ORGANIZED BY THE COMMISSION AND RELATING TO POSTS OF SENIOR SECRETARIAL ASSISTANT IN GRADES B - B AND SECRETARIAL ASSISTANT IN GRADES B - B AND, CONSEQUENTLY, FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE APPOINTMENTS MADE FOLLOWING THIS COMPETITION .  THE APPLICANT RELIES ON VARIOUS SUBMISSIONS, THE FIRST BASED ON THE ABSENCE OF A VACANCY NOTICE PRECEDING THE NOTICE OF COMPETITION, AND THE OTHERS BASED ON IRREGULARITIES ALLEGEDLY VITIATING THE ORGANIZATION AND THE CONDUCT OF THE TESTS AND ON THEIR INCOMPATIBILITY WITH THE OBJECTIVE PURSUED BY THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS IN ADOPTING REGULATION NO 1473/OF JUNE ( OJ L OF . . P . ) AMENDING ANNEX I TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS BY THE CREATION OF TWO NEW BASIC POSTS .  THE COMMISSION, IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF EXECUTIVE SECRETARIES AND PRINCIPAL SECRETARIES WITHIN CAREER BRACKET C AND OF SECRETARY/SHORTHAND-TYPISTS IN CAREER BRACKET C - C 2, WHO ARE FREQUENTLY HELD BACK IN THESE GRADES AT THE END OF THEIR CAREERS AND BECAUSE IT CONSIDERED 'THAT ABOUT PER CENT OF THESE SECRETARIES CARRY OUT SECRETARIAL DUTIES OF CATEGORY B' OBTAINED FROM THE COUNCIL THE CONVERSION OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF POSTS PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED UNDER CATEGORY C INTO POSTS OF SENIOR SECRETARIAL ASSISTANT WITHIN CAREER BRACKET B - B AND OF SECRETARIAL ASSISTANT WITHIN CAREER BRACKET B - B .  WITHOUT PUBLISHING A VACANCY NOTICE, THE COMMISSION ORGANIZED AN INTERNAL COMPETITION BASED ON QUALIFICATIONS AND TESTS, THE CONDITIONS OF WHICH SPECIFIED, INTER ALIA, THAT THE HIGHEST PLACED CANDIDATES, PROVIDED THAT THEY HAD OBTAINED A TOTAL OF MARKS IN THE COMPULSORY TESTS, WOULD BE APPOINTED TO POSTS CONVERTED TO SENIOR SECRETARIAL ASSISTANT IN GRADE B AND THAT THE NEXT CANDIDATES, PROVIDED THAT THEY HAD OBTAINED MARKS, WOULD BE APPOINTED TO POSTS OF SECRETARIAL ASSISTANT IN GRADE B .  THIS COMPETITION, THE CONTENTS OF WHICH WERE IDENTICAL FOR POSTS OF SENIOR SECRETARIAL ASSISTANT ( B - B ) AND OF SECRETARIAL ASSISTANT ( B - B ) INCLUDED, IN ADDITION TO OPTIONAL TESTS, COMPULSORY TESTS, FIRST WRITTEN AND THEN PRACTICAL, AND, FOR THE CANDIDATES WHO HAD PASSED THOSE TESTS, AN ORAL TEST .  LASTLY, A SYSTEM OF BONUS MARKS WAS PROVIDED FOR OFFICIALS WITH GREATER SENIORITY IN THE SERVICE OF THE COMMUNITIES AS A SECRETARY AND/OR PREVIOUS PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE OF SECRETARIAL WORK .  THUS THE COMPETITION, WITHOUT IN PRINCIPLE EXCLUDING OTHER CANDIDATES, CLEARLY FAVOURED SECRETARIES OF THE COMMISSION IN CAREER BRACKETS C AND C - C .  THE APPLICANT, AN EXECUTIVE SECRETARY IN GRADE C 1, WAS INFORMED AFTER TAKING PART IN THE WRITTEN AND PRACTICAL TESTS THAT SHE HAD NOT QUALIFIED FOR THE ORAL TESTS .  BEFORE COMMENCING THE EXAMINATION OF THE FIRST SUBMISSION IT SHOULD BE SAID THAT THERE IS ROOM FOR DOUBT AS TO THE REGULARITY OF A PROCEDURE FOR THE REGRADING OF CERTAIN POSTS AS CONSIDERED NECESSARY, WHICH RESULTS IN DETERMINING FROM AMONGST, A NUMBER OF POSTS THOSE WHICH ARE TO BE REGRADED, NOT IN A GENERAL AND ABSTRACT MANNER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NATURE AND THE LEVEL OF THE DUTIES WHICH THEY INVOLVE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF ARTICLE AND OF ANNEX I OF THE REGULATIONS, BUT, A POSTERIORI, IN ACCORDANCE WITH RESULTS OBTAINED AFTER A COMPETITION BETWEEN HOLDERS, OF POSTS WHO, FURTHERMORE, WILL CONTINUE TO CARRY OUT DUTIES IDENTICAL TO THOSE WHICH THEY PERFORMED PREVIOUSLY .  THIS ARGUMENT, HOWEVER, HAS NOT BEEN RAISED AND THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO EXAMINE IT OF ITS OWN MOTION .  FIRST SUBMISSION  ACCORDING TO THE APPLICANT THE COMPETITION IN QUESTION MUST BE ANNULLED BECAUSE THE NOTICE OF COMPETITION WAS NOT PRECEDED BY THE PUBLICATION OF THE VACANCY NOTICE WHICH IS REQUIRED BY THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS .  THIS SUBMISSION, WHICH RELATES TO A CONDITION OF FORM TO THE FULFILMENT OF WHICH THE REGULARITY OF THE CONTESTED MEASURE IS SUBJECT, IS INADMISSIBLE BECAUSE OF LACK OF INTEREST ON THE PART OF THE APPLICANT .  ALTHOUGH THE VACANCY NOTICE MUST NECESSARILY PRECEDE THE NOTICE OF COMPETITION, FAILING WHICH THERE IS AN INFRINGEMENT OF THE SECOND AND THIRD PARAGRAPHS OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS, THIS IS IN ORDER TO ENABLE THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY TO EXAMINE, BEFORE COMMENCING THE PROCEDURE FOR A COMPETITION, WHETHER THE POST SHOULD BE FILLED BY TRANSFER OR PROMOTION .  THE APPLICANT, HOWEVER, COULD NOT HAVE BENEFITED FROM EITHER OF THESE TWO MEASURES SINCE, BEING AN OFFICIAL IN CATEGORY C, SHE NEEDED TO OBTAIN A POST IN CATEGORY B WHICH, UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS, CAN TAKE PLACE ONLY ON THE BASIS OF A COMPETITION .  FURTHERMORE, THAT OMISSION COULD ALSO HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED POSSIBLE CANDIDATES WHO WERE THEREBY PREVENTED FROM TAKING PART EFFECTIVELY IN THE COMPETITION, BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE AS REGARDS THE APPLICANT .  THE SUBMISSION MUST BE REJECTED .  SECOND SUBMISSION  ACCORDING TO THE APPLICANT THE CONTESTED DECISION INFRINGES ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS CONCERNING THE CLASSIFICATION OF POSTS AND THE DESCRIPTION OF DUTIES CORRESPONDING TO EACH BASIC POST, IN THAT ONE AND THE SAME COMPETITION WAS ORGANIZED FOR DIFFERENT POSTS CORRESPONDING TO DIFFERENT GRADES .  THE ORGANIZATION OF ONE COMPETITION FOR DIFFERENT POSTS WOULD BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH ARTICLE MENTIONED ABOVE IF THIS WERE TO RESULT IN A CLEAR INADEQUACY IN THE TESTS WITH REGARD TO THE EVALUATION WHICH THE SELECTION BOARD MUST MAKE OF THE QUALIFICATIONS REQUIRED TO OCCUPY EITHER OF THE POSTS TO BE FILLED .  ACCORDING TO THE DESCRIPTION OF DUTIES LAID DOWN BY THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION OF MAY 1973, THE POSTS OF SENIOR SECRETARIAL ASSISTANT ( B - B ) AND OF SECRETARIAL ASSISTANT ( B - B ) INVOLVE THE PERFORMANCE OF VERY SIMILAR DUTIES BUT WITH A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY, SINCE HOLDERS OF THE FORMER POSTS HAVE TO BE CAPABLE OF CARRYING OUT DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX SECRETARIAL DUTIES 'WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF GENERAL DIRECTIVES' WHILST HOLDERS OF THE LATTER MUST CARRY OUT THE SAME DUTIES 'UNDER SUPERVISION '.  IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE ORGANIZATION OF A SINGLE COMPETITION AND THE PROVISION THAT THE MORE RESPONSIBLE TASKS WILL BE RESERVED FOR THE HIGHEST PLACED CANDIDATES AND THE TASKS REQUIRING LESS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE PLACED BELOW THE FORMER, DOES NOT INFRINGE ARTICLE QUOTED ABOVE .  THE SUBMISSION MUST BE REJECTED .  THIRD SUBMISSION  THE APPLICANT AGAIN CLAIMS THAT ALTHOUGH THE COMPETITION WAS BASED ON QUALIFICATIONS AND TESTS, THE DEFENDANT ATTACHED TOO MUCH IMPORTANCE TO THE TESTS AND INSUFFICIENT IMPORTANCE TO THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE CANDIDATES .  IN THIS RESPECT, SHE REFERS TO THE WISHES WHICH WERE EXPRESSED BY MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION THAT CAREERS AT THE TOP OF CATEGORY C SHOULD BE CARRIED FORWARD INTO A HIGHER CATEGORY .  SHE ASKS, FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR HER ARGUMENT, THAT THE COURT SHOULD ORDER THE PRODUCTION OF ALL DOCUMENTS AND MINUTES OF THE COMMISSION WHICH LED TO THE PUBLICATION OF THE NOTICE OF COMPETITION .  IT IS ESTABLISHED, AS WAS POINTED OUT ABOVE, THAT THE AIM OF THE CONTESTED COMPETITION WAS TO GIVE CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF OFFICIALS HELD BACK IN GRADES IN CATEGORY C, OR WHO MIGHT BE HELD BACK THERE, THE CHANCE OF ACCESS TO GRADES IN CATEGORY B .  HOWEVER, NEITHER THE NOTICE TO STAFF FROM MR COPPE, A MEMBER OF THE COMMISSION, DATED JUNE ( SCHEDULE V TO THE REPLY ) NOR HIS COMMUNICATION PRECEDING THE NOTICE OF COMPETITION MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO INFER THAT THE INTENTION WAS TO ORGANIZE THE COMPETITION SO AS TO ENSURE, IN FACT, QUASI-AUTOMATICALLY, PROLONGATION OF CAREERS FOR THOSE WITH SENIORITY .  FURTHERMORE, IF SUCH HAD BEEN THE CASE, THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY WOULD HAVE DISREGARDED ARTICLES AND OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  CONSEQUENTLY THE REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS MUST BE REJECTED .  SINCE A CHANGE OF CATEGORY WAS INVOLVED AND A COMPETITION WAS CONSEQUENTLY INDISPENSABLE, THE COMMISSION ENJOYED A WIDE DISCRETION IN DECIDING UPON THE CRITERIA OF ABILITY REQUIRED FOR THE NEWLY-CREATED POST AND, CONSEQUENTLY, IN DECIDING UPON THE RULES OF THE COMPETITION IN VIEW OF THESE CRITERIA AND IN THE INTERESTS OF THE SERVICE .  NO FACTOR HAS BEEN PUT FORWARD TO SHOW THAT THE COMMISSION EXCEEDED THE LIMITS OF THE DISCRETION WHICH IS GRANTED TO IT IN THIS RESPECT .  THE SUBMISSION MUST BE REJECTED .  FOURTH SUBMISSION  THE APPLICANT ALSO CLAIMS THAT THE COMPETITION IS IRREGULAR BECAUSE THE SELECTION BOARD WAS PRESIDED OVER BY A PERSON NOT HAVING THE STATUS OF AN OFFICIAL .  ACCORDING TO ARTICLE OF ANNEX III TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS .  'THE SELECTION BOARD SHALL CONSIST OF A CHAIRMAN, ONE OR MORE PERSONS APPOINTED BY THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY AND AN OFFICIAL APPOINTED BY THE STAFF COMMITTEE .  THE SELECTION BOARD MAY, FOR CERTAIN TESTS, BE ASSISTED BY ONE OR MORE EXAMINERS SERVING IN AN ADVISORY CAPACITY .  MEMBERS OF THE SELECTION BOARD SHALL BE CHOSEN FROM OFFICIALS WHOSE GRADE IS AT LEAST EQUAL TO THAT OF THE POST TO BE FILLED '.  THE APPLICANT WRONGLY DEDUCES FROM THIS PROVISION, AND ESPECIALLY FROM THE THIRD PARAGRAPH THEREOF, THAT THE SELECTION BOARD MUST BE OFFICIALS .  IT APPEARS CLEARLY BOTH FROM A COMPARISON OF THE VERSIONS IN THE VARIOUS LANGUAGES AND FROM THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FIRST AND THIRD PARAGRAPHS OF THE SAID ARTICLE THAT THIS PROVISION MUST BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING THAT IF THE MEMBERS OF THE SELECTION BOARD ARE OFFICIALS, THEY MUST BE OF A GRADE AT LEAST EQUAL TO THAT OF THE POST TO BE FILLED WITHOUT, HOWEVER, EITHER THE MEMBERS OR THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SELECTION BOARD HAVING NECESSARILY TO BE OFFICIALS .  FIFTH AND SIXTH SUBMISSIONS  THE FIFTH AND SIXTH SUBMISSIONS CRITICIZE THE ORGANIZATION OF CERTAIN TESTS AND IN PARTICULAR THE INTERVENTION, FOR THE PRACTICAL TESTS, OF A PRIVATE UNDERTAKING WORKING BY MEANS OF COMPUTERS .  THESE CRITICISMS RELATING TO THE METHODS USED IN THE TESTS WITH VARYING DEGREES OF SUCCESS, CONCERN MATTERS OF FACT WHICH DO NOT BRING THE LEGALITY OF THE COMPETITION INTO QUESTION .  ON THE OTHER HAND THE INTERVENTION OF A THIRD PARTY IN THE ORGANIZATION OF THE TESTS IS AUTHORIZED BY THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF ANNEX III TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS ON CONDITION THAT IT IS IN AN ADVISORY CAPACITY AND THAT THE SELECTION BOARD REGAINS ULTIMATE CONTROL OVER THE PROCEDURES AND ITS DISCRETIONARY POWER .  IT HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN OR EVEN ALLEGED THAT SUCH WAS NOT THE CASE .  THESE SUBMISSIONS MUST BE REJECTED .  
Decision on costs
THE APPLICANT HAS FAILED IN HER APPLICATION .  UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY SHALL BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .  NEVERTHELESS, UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, IN PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES, INSTITUTIONS SHALL BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .
