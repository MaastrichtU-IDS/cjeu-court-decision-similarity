Summary
 $$Pursuant to Article of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of the Justice, an appeal seeking to have an order made by the Court of First Instance set aside must be dismissed as clearly inadmissible where the order under appeal instructs the Commission to produce documents so that they can be placed in the case-file and made available to the other party.  Such an order does not fall within one of the categories of measure against which an appeal may be brought pursuant to the first paragraph of Article of the Statute of the Court of Justice.
