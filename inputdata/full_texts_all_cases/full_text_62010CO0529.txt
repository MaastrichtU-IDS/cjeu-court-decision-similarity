Operative part 
The law of the Union, in particular: the principle of the prohibition of abuse of rights, Article 4(3) TEU, the freedoms guaranteed
         by the FEU Treaty, the principle of non‑discrimination, the rules on State aid and the obligation to ensure the effective
         application of the law of the Union, must be interpreted as not precluding the application, in a case such as that in the
         main proceedings relating to direct taxation, of a provision of national law providing for proceedings pending before the
         court giving judgment at final instance in tax matters to be concluded, on payment of a sum equivalent to 5% of the value
         of the claim, when those proceedings arise from an application made at first instance more than years before the date on
         which that provision entered into force and when the tax authorities have been unsuccessful at first and second instance.
