         nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1810/of September 2004,
         and by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1719/of October 2005, respectively, must be interpreted as meaning that network
         analysers such as those at issue in the main proceedings may be classified in subheading of the combined nomenclature,
         as amended by Regulation No 1810/2004, or in subheading of the combined nomenclature, as amended by Regulation
         No 1719/2005, depending on the date of their import, provided that the devices are intended to measure or check electrical
         quantities, which it is for the national court to ascertain. If they are not, those devices must be classified in subheading
         of the combined nomenclature, as amended by Regulation No 1810/2004, or in subheading of the combined
         nomenclature, as amended by Regulation No 1719/2005, depending on the date of their import.
