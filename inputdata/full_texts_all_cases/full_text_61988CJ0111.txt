Summary
. In the application of Article 108() of the Treaty the Commission has a wide discretion in determining whether the circumstances justify granting a Member State which is experiencing difficulties in its balance of payments authorization to adopt protective measures . In cases involving such discretion, the Court must restrict itself to considering whether the exercise of that discretion contains a manifest error or constitutes a misuse of power or whether the Commission clearly exceeded the bounds of its discretion ( see the judgment of January in Case 11/Piraiki-Patraiki v Commission (( )) ECR ).  . The "consultation with the interested parties" provided for under Article of Commission Decision 86/which is to precede any decision limiting the scope of the authorization given to a Member State experiencing balance of payments difficulties to grant export aid is no more than an expression of the basic principle that every person has a right to be heard in all proceedings the outcome of which may adversely affect him . In the present case, that principle obliges the Commission to inform the Member State concerned of the complaint on the basis of which it proposes to withdraw its authorization for certain types of aid and to afford that Member State an opportunity to make known its views on the accuracy and relevance of the facts and circumstances alleged .
