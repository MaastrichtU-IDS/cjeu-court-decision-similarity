IN CASE 76/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE TRIBUNAL DU TRAVAIL OF BRUSSELS FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  MICHEL S . OF BRUSSELS  AND  LE FONDS NATIONAL DE RECLASSEMENT SOCIAL DES HANDICAPES, OF BRUSSELS  
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1612/68/EEC OF THE COUNCIL OF OCTOBER 1968, RELATING TO THE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT FOR WORKERS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY ( OJ L OF OCTOBER 1968, P . ), 
Grounds
BY JUDGMENT OF NOVEMBER 1972, RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON NOVEMBER 1972, THE TRIBUNAL DU TRAVAIL OF BRUSSELS REFERRED, UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY, THE QUESTION WHETHER THE BENEFITS PROVIDED FOR BY THE BELGIAN LAW OF APRIL WHICH RELATE TO THE REHABILITATION OF THE HANDICAPPED CONSTITUTE SOCIAL BENEFITS WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1612/OF THE COUNCIL OF OCTOBER ( OJ L OF OCTOBER 1968, P . ) RELATING TO FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT FOR WORKERS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY .  IT APPEARS FROM THE DOSSIER THAT THIS APPLICATION CONCERNS THE CASE OF A PERSON OF ITALIAN NATIONALITY WHO HAS NEVER HELD THE POSITION OF A WORKER AND WHOSE POSSIBILITIES OF EMPLOYMENT ARE REDUCED BECAUSE OF AN INADEQUACY OR DIMINUTION IN HIS MENTAL CAPACITY . HE IS THE SON OF AN ITALIAN WORKER WHO WAS EMPLOYED IN BELGIUM UNTIL HIS DEATH .  BY THE QUESTION WHICH HAS BEEN RAISED IT IS ASKED WHETHER ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1612/CONFERS ON THIS CHILD THE RIGHT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE, UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS AS BELGIAN NATIONALS, OF BENEFITS PROVIDED FOR BY THE ABOVE-MENTIONED BELGIAN LAW, WHICH IN PARTICULAR HAS AS ITS OBJECT TO REALIZE OR IMPROVE THE APTITUDE FOR WORK OF THE HANDICAPPED OF BELGIAN NATIONALITY, WHETHER OR NOT THESE PERSONS ARE WORKERS OR THE CHILDREN OF WORKERS .  BY ROYAL DECREE OF MAY 1968, THE SCOPE OF THE SAID LAW HAS BEEN EXTENDED, UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, TO PERSONS OF FOREIGN NATIONALITY .  WHILST THE COURT, ACTING WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF ARTICLE 177, HAS NO JURISDICTION TO APPLY THE COMMUNITY RULE TO A SPECIFIC CASE, NOR, CONSEQUENTLY, TO PRONOUNCE ON A PROVISION OF NATIONAL LAW WITH REGARD TO SUCH RULE, IT CAN HOWEVER PROVIDE A NATIONAL COURT WITH THE FACTORS OF INTERPRETATION DEPENDING ON COMMUNITY LAW WHICH COULD BE USEFUL TO IT IN EVALUATING THE EFFECTS OF SUCH PROVISION .  BY ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 1612/68, " THE WORKER WHO IS A NATIONAL OF A MEMBER STATE, SHALL NOT, WITHIN THE TERRITORY OF OTHER MEMBER STATES, BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY BY REASON OF HIS NATIONALITY FROM THE WORKERS OF THAT STATE, IN RELATION TO ANY CONDITIONS OF WORK AND EMPLOYMENT, IN PARTICULAR IN MATTERS OF REMUNERATION, DISMISSAL, AND REINSTATEMENT IN OCCUPATION OR RE-EMPLOYMENT IF HE BECOMES UNEMPLOYED ".  BY VIRTUE OF ARTICLE ( ) AND ( ), THE SAID WORKER WHEN IN THE TERRITORY OF OTHER MEMBER STATES, SHALL ENJOY " THE SAME SOCIAL BENEFITS ... AS THE WORKERS OF THAT STATE " AND " ON THE SAME BASIS AND UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS AS WORKERS OF THAT STATE, TEACHING AT VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS AND CENTRES OF REHABILITATION AND RETRAINING ".  AS IS APPARENT IN PARTICULAR FROM THE USE OF THE EXPRESSIONS " REINSTATEMENT IN OCCUPATION ", " REHABILITATION " AND " RETRAINING ", THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE EXTEND TO MEASURES PROVIDED BY NATIONAL LEGISLATION WITH A VIEW TO ALLOWING HANDICAPPED WORKERS TO RECOVER THEIR ABILITY TO WORK .  HOWEVER, THE BENEFITS REFERRED TO BY THE SAID ARTICLE ARE THOSE WHICH, BEING CONNECTED WITH EMPLOYMENT, ARE TO BENEFIT THE WORKERS THEMSELVES . BENEFITS RESERVED FOR THE MEMBERS OF THEIR FAMILIES ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLE .  THIS INTERPRETATION RESULTS AS MUCH FROM THE WORDING OF THIS ARTICLE AS FROM THE SCHEME OF REGULATION NO 1612/68, IN WHICH ARTICLE APPEARS IN PART 1, TITLE 2, HEADED " EXERCISE OF EMPLOYMENT AND EQUALITY OF TREATMENT ", THIS TITLE BEING FOLLOWED BY A THIRD TITLE RESERVED FOR " FAMILIES OF WORKERS " ( CF RECTIFICATION TO THE SAME REGULATION, OJ L OF DECEMBER 1968, P . ).  WITH A VIEW TO PLACING THE NATIONAL COURT IN A POSITION TO ACT WITH A COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE OF THE COMMUNITY RULE, IT IS APPROPRIATE TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER THE PROVISIONS OF THIS THIRD TITLE OF THE REGULATION CONFER ON PERSONS IN THE SAME POSITION AS THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION THE RIGHT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE BENEFITS IN QUESTION UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS AS NATIONALS WHO ARE IN A SIMILAR POSITION .  BY ARTICLE OF THE SAID REGULATION " THE CHILDREN OF A NATIONAL OF A MEMBER STATE, WHO IS OR HAS BEEN EMPLOYED IN THE TERRITORY OF ANOTHER MEMBER STATE, SHALL BE ADMITTED TO COURSES OF GENERAL EDUCATION, APPRENTICESHIP AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS AS THE NATIONALS OF THAT STATE, IF THOSE CHILDREN RESIDE IN ITS TERRITORY ". THE MEMBER STATES ARE DIRECTED TO ENCOURAGE " STEPS ALLOWING SUCH CHILDREN TO FOLLOW THE ABOVEMENTIONED COURSES UNDER THE BEST CONDITIONS ".  BY THE FIFTH RECITAL OF THIS REGULATION, THE LATTER HAS BEEN ADOPTED INTER ALIA ON THE GROUND " THAT THE RIGHT OF FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT DEMANDS FOR ITS EXERCISE, CONDITIONS WHICH ARE OBJECTIVELY THOSE OF LIBERTY AND DIGNITY, THE ELIMINATION OF OBSTACLES WHICH IMPEDE THE MOBILITY OF WORKERS, ESPECIALLY AS REGARDS THE RIGHT OF THE WORKER TO BE REUNITED WITH HIS FAMILY, AND THE CONDITIONS OF INTEGRATION OF SUCH FAMILY IN THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE HOST COUNTRY ".  SUCH INTEGRATION PRESUPPOSES THAT, IN THE CASE OF THE HANDICAPPED CHILD OF A FOREIGN WORKER, THIS CHILD CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BENEFITS PROVIDED BY THE LAWS OF THE HOST COUNTRY WITH A VIEW TO THE REHABILITATION OF THE HANDICAPPED, UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS AS NATIONALS WHO ARE IN A SIMILAR POSITION .  THE FACT THAT THE ABOVEMENTIONED ARTICLE DOES NOT EXPRESSLY REFER TO EDUCATIONAL ARRANGEMENT PROVIDED IN FAVOUR OF SUCH CHILDREN, IS NOT TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS DENOTING THE INTENTION TO EXCLUDE THESE ARRANGEMENTS FROM THE SCOPE OF THE REGULATION, BUT IS EXPLAINED BY THE DIFFICULTY OF MENTIONING ALL HYPOTHESES EXHAUSTIVELY, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF AN EXCEPTIONAL CHARACTER, IN VIEW OF WHICH IT IS NECESSARY TO GUARANTEE THE EQUALITY OF NATIONALS OF ALL THE MEMBER STATES, IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE RIGHT OF FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT CAN BE EXERCISED TO ITS FULL EXTENT .  UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, ARTICLE IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD IN THE SENSE THAT IT EMBRACES THE MEASURES PROVIDED BY NATIONAL LAWS WHICH ALLOW THE HANDICAPPED TO REALIZE OR IMPROVE THEIR APTITUDE FOR WORK AND THUS IT HAS AMONG ITS OBJECTS THE GUIDANCE, TRAINING, AND VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION AND RETRAINING OF THE SAID HANDICAPPED .  FINALLY, THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLES AND OF REGULATION NO 1612/TO SUCH LEGISLATION IS NOT EXCLUDED BY THE FACT THAT SUCH LEGISLATION REFERS TO THE HANDICAPPED AS A WHOLE AND NOT ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE THE POSITION OF WORKERS OR THE CHILDREN OF WORKERS .
