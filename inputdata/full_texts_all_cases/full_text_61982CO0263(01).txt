Grounds
BY DECISION 1191/82/ECSC OF AUGUST THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES FOUND THAT KLOCKNER-WERKE AG HAD EXCEEDED BY TONNES THE PRODUCTION QUOTA FOR ROLLED PRODUCTS OF GROUP I WHICH HAD BEEN ALLOCATED TO IT FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF PURSUANT TO DECISION 2794/80/ECSC ( THE GENERAL DECISION ), AND FINED IT THEREFORE ( TEN MILLION , ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY-TWO ) EUROPEAN CURRENCY UNITS , OR DM ( TWENTY-THREE MILLION , NINE HUNDRED AND NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN ).   BY AN APPLICATION REGISTERED AT THE COURT ON SEPTEMBER THE APPLICANT BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE DECISION WAS VOID .   BY A SEPARATE DOCUMENT REGISTERED AT THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY IT MADE AN APPLICATION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY AND ARTICLE ET SEQ . OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE FOR AN INTERIM ORDER SUSPENDING THE OPERATION OF THE CONTESTED DECISION . IN THE COURSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS CONCERNING THE APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF AN INTERIM ORDER THE COMMISSION STATED THAT IT HAD NO OBJECTION TO A SUSPENSION PROVIDED , HOWEVER , THAT IT WAS MADE     SUBJECT TO PRIOR LODGING OF A SECURITY . THE APPLICANT , HOWEVER , SUBMITTED THAT THE APPLICATION SHOULD BE GRANTED WITHOUT ITS HAVING TO DO SO .   BY AN ORDER OF NOVEMBER THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT ORDERED THE OPERATION OF ARTICLE OF THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION OF AUGUST TO BE SUSPENDED ON CONDITION THAT THE APPLICATION FIRST LODGED A BANK GUARANTEE , APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION , AS SECURITY FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE FINE TOGETHER WITH DEFAULT INTEREST CALCULATED AT 1% ABOVE THE DEUTSCHE BUNDESBANK ' S DISCOUNT RATE . IN ADDITION , THE APPLICANT WAS ALLOWED DAYS FROM THE NOTIFICATION OF THE ORDER TO LODGE THE GUARANTEE .   BY AN APPLICATION REGISTERED AT THE COURT ON DECEMBER THE APPLICANT REQUESTED THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT TO MODIFY THE ORDER OF NOVEMBER AND TO SUSPEND THE OPERATION OF THE COMMISSION ' S DECISION UNCONDITIONALLY PENDING JUDGMENT ON THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CASE .   IN SUPPORT OF ITS REQUEST IT RELIES UPON A DECLARATION , REFERRED TO AS AN ' ' EIDESSTATTLICHE ERKLARUNG ' '  ( AFFIDAVIT ) MADE BY ITS FINANCIAL DIRECTOR AND A STATEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN OF ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS ( VORSTAND ) TO THE EFFECT THAT THE CREDITS AVAILABLE TO THE APPLICANT ARE WHOLLY TAKEN UP WITH FINANCING ITS BUSINESS AND MUST , IF THE UNDERTAKING IS TO CONTINUE IN BUSINESS , REMAIN THUS ASSIGNED .   EACH OF THE MATTERS PUT FORWARD BY THE APPLICANT IN SUPPORT OF THIS FRESH APPLICATION HAS ALREADY BEEN PUT FORWARD BY IT IN THE PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO THE PREVIOUS APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES , WHEN THEY WERE CHALLENGED BY THE COMMISSION . THEY WERE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN THE ORDER OF NOVEMBER , WHICH STATED AS FOLLOWS :    ' ' THE APPLICANT HAS NOT ADDUCED ANY OTHER CONTENTIONS WHICH WOULD JUSTIFY MAKING AN EXCEPTION IN ITS FAVOUR . THEREFORE THE LODGING OF SECURITY CANNOT CAUSE THE APPLICANT SERIOUS AND IRREPARABLE DAMAGE EITHER AS A RESULT OF THE EXPENSE WHICH IT INVOLVES OR OF THE EFFECT WHICH IT MAY HAVE ON THE APPLICANT ' S FINANCIAL POSITION . ' '       IT MUST BE NOTED FURTHER THAT IN ITS FRESH APPLICATION THE APPLICANT DOES NOT SHOW , OR EVEN SEEK TO SHOW OR TO STATE , THAT IT HAS TAKEN STEPS TO TRY TO OBTAIN A BANK GUARANTEE .   PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT MAY GRANT AN APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES EVEN BEFORE THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE OPPOSITE PARTY HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED . SINCE NO ARGUMENT HAS BEEN ADDUCED WHICH MIGHT REASONABLY LEAD THE PRESIDENT TO CONSIDER MODIFYING THE MEASURES CONTAINED IN THE ORDER OF NOVEMBER , IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT A DECISION BE MADE , PURSUANT TO THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PROVISION , WITHOUT ITS BEING NECESSARY TO INVITE THE COMMISSION TO SUBMIT ITS OBSERVATIONS .   IN THE LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT COSTS SHOULD NOT BE RESERVED BUT THAT THE APPLICANT SHOULD BE ORDERED FORTHWITH TO PAY THEM .  
Operative part
ON THOSE GROUNDS , THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT  HEREBY ORDERS AS FOLLOWS :   . THE APPLICATION FOR THE ADOPTION OF INTERIM MEASURES IS DISMISSED .  . THE APPLICANT SHALL PAY THE COSTS .
