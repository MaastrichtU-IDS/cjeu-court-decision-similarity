Order of the Court (Sixth Chamber) of June – Vino v Poste Italiane 
(Case C-161/11)
Articles 92(1), 103(1) and 104(3) of the Rules of Procedure – Social policy – Fixed-term employment contracts – Public sector – First or only contract – Derogation from the obligation to state objective reasons – Principle of non-discrimination – Lack of connection to European Union law – Clear lack of jurisdiction of the Court
Preliminary rulings – Jurisdiction of the Court – Limits – Question raised in a case concerning national, not Union, law – Clear lack of jurisdiction of the Court (Art. TFEU) (see paras 35-41)
Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling – Tribunale di Trani – Interpretation of the general European Union principles of equal
                  treatment and non-discrimination and of Articles and of the Charter of Fundamental Rights – Fields of application of
                  those principles – Compatibility of national legislation validating in the national legal system a clause not specifying the
                  reason for employment on a fixed-term basis for recruitment of workers at the SpA Poste Italiane.
               
Operative part
The Court of Justice of the European Union clearly has no jurisdiction to answer the questions referred by the Tribunale di
         Trani (Italy) by decision of February 2011.
