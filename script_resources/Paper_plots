Syntactic:
TF-IDF

Semantic:
Word2Vec + Cosine Similarity (Doc2Vec) - vector size, window size, epochs
Word2Vec + WMD
Bert + Cosine
Law2Vec + Cosine

Plots:

1. Money plot! (Overlap with citations and similarity networks)
	- Split into one for each algorithm?

2. All plots include outgoing and incoming edges

3. Matrix plot showing overlap for subsets (topics, models etc. ) in percentage

4. Citation network alone? 

5. Similarity Network alone?

6. Do we want to split either of the graphs by topics?

7. Table for results for syntactic and semantic algorithms
